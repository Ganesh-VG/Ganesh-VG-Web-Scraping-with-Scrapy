    "article_content": "ETMarkets.com These are companies which are very liquid, should not have a problem in exiting if you really need to. \"FMCG is a default play, you would want to kind of, because many of the staples, etc, have not done anything for many years now. But that said, it is not as if the volume growth will pick up in a big way and overall these are very expensive stocks,\" says Anand Tandon , Independent Analyst. What is the view on IT and FMCG? Would you be a buyer in select IT and FMCG? Well, FMCG perhaps more than IT. There is no doubt both of the sectors have been under-owned and have underperformed quite considerably. Right now, I think the market is looking for areas to rotate into given the fact that the sectors that have actually led the rally so far, which has been mostly PSUs and so on may take a breather for a while and therefore, even though there are no great upticks that are likely in IT at least, one is still looking for sectors which have not moved so far. And in that context, I think is what you are looking at the moment we are seeing today. There is some case to be made for domestic consumption players to move up, especially those which are related to rural incomes because that will undoubtedly have to be one of the areas which the new government has to focus on and from that context is what I said that I would prefer FMCG kind of stocks more than perhaps the IT ones. .jumptextrow, .jumplinkwrap{margin:15px 0;} article.artData .artText table td {vertical-align:middle} Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO Courses Offering College Course Website Indian School of Business ISB Chief Digital Officer Visit Indian School of Business ISB Chief Technology Officer Visit IIM Lucknow Chief Operations Officer Programme Visit What is the take though on FMCG? You think that was just panic buying that we saw on and maybe a little bit of follow through or is there material reason to believe there will be a rural recovery in place pushed by the government perhaps this time? Well, most of the stars are lining up for a rural recovery, whether it is the fact that, as I mentioned just a while back, that the election mandate does seem to indicate that more needs to be done in rural India and consequently the government has to take more measures to increase the income streams there. Also, I think nature itself will take its own course. The monsoon is likely to be good, which will mean that agricultural income will possibly be better. The crop output is likely to be better and perhaps with some support from the government we are likely to get better realisations as well. So, as a combination, I expect to see a significant increase in rural demand coming through and therefore, you are looking for direct farm plays as well as indirect ways of looking at where rural consumption can actually increase demand. FMCG is a default play, you would want to kind of, because many of the staples, etc, have not done anything for many years now. But that said, it is not as if the volume growth will pick up in a big way and overall these are very expensive stocks. So, from a portfolio sector rotation point of view, I think there is perhaps a little more steam left. Bottom-up, it is not as if it is a screaming buy, but even then compared to many of the other sectors, it still looks relatively fine. Since we are talking about rural recovery, what about the allied segment and I am talking about, let us say, chemicals for instance or the pumps company or the other allies which is there in terms of the water infrastructure, etc. Is this also one of the ways to probably play that? Well, certainly almost everything that goes into the rural part of the country will be something that will have some triggers. I am not so certain about the water play, etc, because that is largely capex driven and has to be, therefore, funded by the government. The rural consumption plays are the easier play and I would expect that even the agri input companies can be doing quite well. So, you mentioned chemicals and specifically I would look for pesticides, fertilisers, all of that should see a resurgence in demand given the context in which we are operating, which is forecast of a normal monsoon. Is that your feeling as well that it is the beaten down banking names, the large private banking lot which will now make a comeback and it has already begun actually with some of them? Well, I have been bullish on that sector for quite a while now and it has not performed at all. Every dog has his days, it is perhaps time to get back. At the end of the day finance and banking related stocks form almost a third of the Nifty and that cannot be underperforming if the Nifty has to continue to go up. More importantly both from a valuation perspective historically as well as relatively to the rest of the market this sector has now become quite cheap. So, the larger companies, the private sector players which have been kind of dragging their feet are certainly attractively valued at this stage and are quite likely to resume their growth journey over the next few years. What should one do about the rally that we have seen in Amara Raja as well as Exide this year? I mean part of the Street has a clear FOMO feeling because they missed out on that and the other half is wondering should they book out, what should they do perhaps add, what is your view on Amara Raja as well as Exide? Whenever any company kind of goes through a major upswing I would not like to comment on the FOMO, but the reality is that it basically borrows from the future in terms of the returns that it is able to get. Amara Raja for example one of the major issues is what is it going to do in the EV world, we have not sorted out that problem yet and therefore there are some existential challenges if they do not sort it out. Exide at least is better positioned because they have some tie-ups on the EV side as well. So, between the two I think at least in terms of where the business strategy is headed, it is clear that Exide is a little further up the curve than Amara Raja is, that does not mean that the management there must not be trying, they must be trying to find some kind of technology tie-ups as well and ways to stay in the EV space because any battery manufacturer knows that maybe that is something that you will have to cover. Overall as I said there is a certain level of growth that you should expect in these companies and whenever the growth oversteps itself, you have to be assuming that going forward the future growth is therefore going to be a little less. I do not believe that chasing stocks is necessarily the best way of investing. What is your take within all of these power names and I am talking about the thermal energy plays as well as the wind energy plays which have seen quite a bit of run up and even financiers for that matter, PFC, REC? Should one hold on or would you recommend maybe kind of booking some profits there? Well, it is a sector which is going to do quite well and the demand side is very robust at this stage. But having said that, they are utilities at the end of the day and they are regulated utilities at that. Therefore, the kind of return that you can expect for both NTPC and Power Grid is really dependent on the capex and the capitalisation that they do and therefore, the return that they are able to get on their capitalised assets, that automatically puts a cap on both the growth as well as the levels at which they can trade at.

But given the kind of momentum that the market is in, it may not necessarily mean that investors should rush out to sell. So, fresh money buy, I do not think is indicated.

    "article_content": "ANI Representational image India 's oil and gas sector is poised for a nuanced fiscal performance in FY24, with anticipated declines in downstream profits contrasting with robust upstream growth, according to the latest analysis from Fitch Ratings . #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Fitch projects a 3 per cent-4 per cent increase in India's petroleum product demand for the fiscal year ending in March 2025 (FY25), buoyed by rising consumer, industrial, and infrastructure needs. This is in tandem with an expected GDP growth of 7 per cent. Diesel and petrol will continue to dominate the consumption landscape, accounting for over half of the overall demand, which grew by 5 per cent in FY24 and 2 per cent in the initial months of FY25. Indian oil marketing companies (OMCs) are anticipated to maintain steady marketing margins in FY25. You Might Also Like: Q4 results: Stable costs boost India Inc. profits Despite a forecasted dip in Brent crude oil prices to USD 77.5 per barrel from USD 82 in FY24, margins should remain stable. This stability is expected even in the face of a recent INR 2 per litre cut in diesel and petrol prices, the first such reduction in nearly two years. However, Fitch warns that rising crude prices amid geopolitical uncertainties could apply pressure on these margins. OMCs are expected to see a reduction in their EBITDA from FY24's peak levels, driven by steady marketing and softening refining margins. You Might Also Like: Credit profile of fertiliser companies to remain comfortable in FY25: Ind-Ra This moderation is attributed to weaker product cracks, reduced exports from Asia, and lower benefits from crude price differentials, despite a decline in special excise duties on diesel and aviation fuel exports. The upstream segment is expected to remain robust, with low-single digit percentage growth in oil and gas production supporting strong cash flows. Key players like Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited ( ONGC ), Oil India Limited (OIL), and Reliance Industries Ltd ( RIL ) will benefit from elevated crude prices, even though they may not reach FY24 highs. In FY24, domestic oil and gas production rose by 3 per cent, bolstered by a 6 per cent increase in gas output. You Might Also Like: India fossil fuel consumption up 8% in 2023 Fitch anticipates high capital expenditure (capex) levels among industry players. Upstream companies are likely to maintain high capex to drive production growth and ensure reserve adequacy, while sovereign-backed downstream entities are set to invest heavily in refining, petrochemical, and retail capacity expansions. Investments in energy transition initiatives are expected to rise gradually across the sector. India's crude oil production is forecasted to grow by mid-single digit percentages in FY25, driven by production increases at ONGC's and RIL's offshore fields in the Krishna-Godavari Basin, and technology-driven output stabilization efforts at mature fields. Despite this growth, the country's dependence on crude oil imports will likely increase, as consumption growth is set to outpace domestic production. In FY24, India's crude oil import dependency climbed to 87.8 per cent, up from 87.4 per cent in FY23, with Russia emerging as the largest oil supplier, accounting for 36 per cent of imports. India's natural gas production is expected to grow by low-single digits in FY25, supported by ongoing development projects at ONGC and RIL. However, this growth may slow as RIL's Krishna-Godavari Basin field approaches peak production. The domestic gas sector saw a 6 per cent production increase in FY24, driven by strong demand from city gas distribution (CGD) companies. LNG imports, which grew by 16 per cent in FY24, are expected to rise further by mid-to-high single digits in FY25 due to increased demand and moderated international gas prices. Petroleum product demand is projected to rise by mid-single digits in FY25, driven by strong growth in automobile sales, infrastructure spending, and economic expansion. FY24 saw a 5 per cent increase in demand as GDP grew by 8.2 per cent. Diesel and petrol sales experienced significant growth, driven by commercial-vehicle demand and increased travel, respectively. Exports of petroleum products rose by 2 per cent in FY24 after a decline in FY23. State-owned OMCs are expected to retain their dominance in the fuel retail market, expanding their outlet share to 90.4 per cent by May 2024 from 89.9 per cent in March 2022. The private sector has taken a more cautious approach due to volatile crude prices and stagnant retail fuel prices for much of FY23-FY24. The number of compressed natural gas (CNG) stations in India has grown significantly, from around 1,300 in early 2018 to 6,861 by April 2024, with continued high growth expected due to favorable investment plans and CNG's cost advantages over liquid fuels. The downstream oil and gas industry involves refining crude oil into consumable products and marketing them. On the other hand, in the oil and gas industry, upstream refers to the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas.

    "article_content": "A STAFF REPORTER Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will chair the 53rd GST Council meeting in New Delhi The 53rd meeting of Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) Council is likely to consider a number of measures at its meeting on Saturday that are expected to set the tone for broader tax reforms in the upcoming full first budget of Modi 3.0. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} The council is expected to discuss the use of GST compensation cess amount collected from sin goods such as pan masala, cigarettes, etc. which may amount to Rs 70,000 crore. Other discussions may include the conditional waiver of interest or penalty on tax notices issued between 2017 and 2020, barring cases of wilful default and review of the decision to levy 28 per cent GST on the full value of bets for online gaming companies The GST Council may also deliberate on streamlining timelines for issuing notices, establishing monetary thresholds for pursuing disputes in the GST Appellate Tribunal, and setting a deadline for anti-profiteering cases. These reforms aim to minimize tax litigation and enhance the ease of doing business. These measures are expected to provide respite to various sectors such as online gaming, insurance firms, banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), airlines, and shipping companies, which have been grappling with substantial tax liabilities. GST council meet: Sin goods windfall The Centre could receive an unexpected windfall of Rs 70,000 crore through a strong goods and services tax (GST) compensation cess, even after repaying loans taken on behalf of states during the Covid-19 period. You Might Also Like: India’s ‘sin’ is govt’s bounty: GST cess may deliver Rs 70,000 cr bonanza This additional cess is imposed on items deemed as \"sin goods,\" including pan masala, cigarettes, carbonated beverages, and automobiles, which already attract the maximum 28% GST rate. \"Going by the collection trend we would be able to make a prepayment of all the loans much ahead of the March 2026 deadline (and) would also be left with about Rs 65,000-70,000 crore,\" a senior official told ET. The Centre is yet to take a final call on the use of this extra cess amount, but officials expect the issue to resonate in the GST Council meeting on Saturday when discussion begins on rate rationalisation. Online gaming on GST council meet agenda The GST council is expected to review the decision to levy 28 per cent GST on the full value of bets for online gaming companies, which came into effect on October 1, 2023. You Might Also Like: Waiver, other tax reforms top GST Council's docket During its meetings in July and August, the GST Council approved amendments to include online gaming, casinos, and horse racing as taxable actionable claims. It clarified that these activities would be subject to a 28% tax on the full bet value. Initially, it was announced that a review of the implementation would take place after six months. Recently, the GST Council is expected to reassess its decision regarding the imposition of a 28% GST on the entire bet value for online gaming firms, which became effective from October 1, 2023. In response to this decision, more than 70 show cause notices have been issued to online gaming companies, alleging GST evasion amounting to over Rs 1.12 lakh crore for the financial years 2022-23 and 2023-24. Many of them have gone to court against the notices and the cases are pending. GST Council is likely to discuss the legality of the show cause notices served to online gaming companies and the way forward. GST council meet: Corporate guarantees The council is also expected to review its last meeting decision to levy 18 per cent GST on guarantees provided by corporates to their subsidiaries. The Punjab and Haryana High Court has issued a stay on the CBIC circular regarding corporate guarantees. A review of the legal implications of this circular is expected to be discussed during the meeting scheduled for today. GST on Fertilisers The council may also discuss the recommendations made by the Standing Committee on Chemicals and Fertilisers in February to reduce GST on nutrients and raw materials in the interest of fertiliser manufacturing companies and farmers, reported PTI. Currently, GST at a 5 per cent rate is charged on fertilisers, while raw materials like Sulphuric Acid and Ammonia face a higher GST at 18 per cent. The issue of further reduce tax on fertilisers was placed before the GST council in its 45th and 47th meetings held in September 2021 and June 2022, though the council did not recommend any change in rates. Saturday's Council meeting will be held after a gap of eight months. The 52nd GST Council meeting took place on October 7, 2023. Clarification for telcos The GST Council is likely to clarify that telecom companies will have to pay GST, along with the instalments paid towards spectrum charges. The clarification should end confusion among field formations regarding the method for collection of GST in the spectrum auction process. Currently, the GST regime has five broad tax slabs of zero, 5, 12, 18, and 28 per cent. A cess is levied over and above the highest 28 per cent rate on luxury and demerit goods. GST council meet: Other likely discussions Also, the GST council may set a timeframe for the GoM on rate rationalisation to submit a report. The GoM has been reconstituted twice in the last one year and now is headed by Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary. The council is also likely to vet the amendments in the GST law with respect to a decision taken in the previous meeting in October last year. The council had decided to give up the right to tax Extra Neutral Alcohol or ENA (raw product for making alcohol for human consumption) to states. Accordingly, ENA used for human consumption will be exempt from Goods and Services Tax (GST), and states can continue to levy VAT. ENA for industrial use will continue to be taxed at 18 per cent under the GST. To bring about this change, an amendment is required in the GST law.

    "article_content": "Wake up and smell the straw Somnath Mukherjee In a famous barnstorming speech, then-US senator Richard Nixon, battling charges of embezzlement of election funds, made an emotional appeal to voters. He invoked his modest background, attacked his opponents and, most memorably, declared his intention to retain one 'gift', a dog his kids called Checkers. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Since then, the 'Checkers Speech' has become famous in the US as a storied instance of the 'straw man' phenomenon. His critics had said nothing about a pet dog. But Nixon pivoted the narrative by putting Checkers at the centre of the critique. He succeeded, winning his nomination and election as Dwight Eisenhower's veepee in 1952. Straw-man invocations are common to politics and policymaking debates. For example, the debate on India 's attempts at recovering its manufacturing mojo has pivoted around a straw man - jobs . Unfortunately, supporters and critics have ping-ponged the same straw man. Supporters claim manufacturing is important because it will help create lots of jobs. Critics, like former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, say India has lost the manufacturing race. They cite scant job creation in PLI projects, and advise focusing on services to create jobs. But, beyond politics, manufacturing is not about jobs. Not in India, not anywhere else. China, the world's largest factory, with a manufacturing output of $5 tn, employs around 100 mn workers in manufacturing - that's less than 20% of its workforce. India, with a manufacturing output of $500 bn, employs 27-62 mn workers (depending on the survey one is quoting) - that's less than 15% of workers. So, manufacturing is not a massive jobs sink. As Indian manufacturing approaches Chinese levels of productivity, chances are that it will need fewer workers, not more. With increased automation, the employment intensity of manufacturing is on a secular decline. For example, Bajaj Auto , India's largest two-wheeler manufacturer, produced less than 2 mn two-wheelers in 2008-09. In 2023-24, production doubled to nearly 3.7 mn. During the same period, the total number of workers employed by Bajaj remained roughly the same. No wonder bulk of the population, even in highly industrialised Asian countries, is employed in services. In China, despite its monster manufacturing capacities, half of its workers are employed in services. But it's not about jobs at all because of the following factors: Balance trade deficits : An economy high on services and limited manufacturing runs into an issue with trade deficits. Most services are non-tradable - a barber or chef, for example, can't deliver his or her services remotely across territories. An economy that has limited tradables - goods and services that can be exported across large distances - typically ends up with large trade deficits. While some services can be traded, like IT, there are limits to their scalability. Global services trade comprises about one-third global goods. No wonder countries with limited manufacturing capacities (relative to their economic size) also tend to have structural current account deficit (CAD). Britain and the US are good examples from the developed world. However, access to a reserve currency affords developed countries more policy options to deal with structural CAD compared to emerging markets. India's CAD has been structural, and a perpetual policy constraint for the country since Independence. While it now has wider pools of capital flows to finance the deficit, it still has an overbearing impact on efficiency in policymaking. Whether determining trade policy, or arriving at an appropriate monetary policy stance, a structural CAD forces trade-offs between economic stability and income growth. It is no longer just an economic policy constraint but a geopolitical one as well, as recent events around the Russia-Ukraine war so vividly demonstrated. Imagine Russia having a structural CAD while its forex reserves were frozen. Enhancing India's manufacturing capacities is imperative for both economic and national security. Derisk supply chains: High dependence on China for active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), rare earth minerals (critical for various industries including semiconductors) or heavy machinery for the industrial value chain , present large, un-diversifiable risks. Recent experience with Covid vaccines, where countries ringfenced vaccine supplies - as well as vaccine raw materials - for their use, illustrated that point sharply. As the world convulses towards new geopolitical cleavages after three decades of a 'relative pause of history', India can't afford to leave itself politically vulnerable due to a weak manufacturing base. Even as India's economy tops global charts on growth, imports from China topped $100 bn in FY24. Recent news about factories running idle and waiting for Chinese technicians to operate them vividly drives home the story of dependence. This is too important a business to be lost in a straw-man debate. India needs a larger manufacturing base, and a jobs 'debate' is a waste of time. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} (Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

AP Moller-Maersk (Maersk) today announced a revolutionary eCommerce fulfilment solution in India with which all elements of an eCommerce fulfilment solution will be available through a single window at a flat rate of INR 80 per order. This solution has primarily been targeted at a typical small or medium e-commerce business in India that relies on multiple logistics partners for different activities. With this solution, Maersk is taking the complexities out of its customers’ supply chains by providing single-window access to all required solutions, such as storage in warehouses, last-mile deliveries and executing return orders, all while providing end-to-end visibility at unified pricing. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Vikash Agarwal , Managing Director, Maersk South Asia , said in a statement, “India’s eCommerce business has great growth potential. But the highly fragmented market and supply chain complexity are hurdles to many businesses' growth. With our new solution, we want to stay true to our purpose of improving life for all by integrating the world.” He added, “With our ‘One Country, one Price’ solution, we will take complexities out of our customers’ supply chains and grow with them as they focus on what they do the best.” Boosting trade in a digital Bharat The recent India e-Conomy Report 2023 shows that in India, the average hours spent per day per user are 6.5 as compared to 5.5 in China and 7 in the US. However, when it comes to digital payments, the number of real-time transactions per capita per year is 65 in India as compared to 12 in China and 8 in the USA. India had 220 million online shoppers between May 2022 and May 2023. Further, the report shows there are 700 million internet users in the country, of which 350 million use digital payments. These staggering statistics prove the potential the e-commerce sector holds in India. The Integrated Solution In a typical fulfilment solution for eCommerce business, multiple interfaces are involved that take care of different elements of logistics. It all starts with picking up finished goods from a manufacturing facility or origin and moving them to a warehouse. Then comes the element of receiving orders through an online eCommerce platform and connecting that order for further processing at a warehouse before it is delivered to the end consumer. All these solutions are managed by more than one logistics partner in India. With the new eCommerce fulfilment solution, all these logistics requirements will be available to the eCommerce business through Maersk as a single partner. The enablers for Maersk to deploy such a solution include multiple warehousing facilities in multiple cities. One Country, One Price The prevalent fragmented logistics solutions are also responsible for fragmented billing. ECommerce businesses are charged differently and separately for each logistics service rendered, making for extremely complex billing. With its ‘One Country, One Price’ solution, Maersk is bringing all the services under a single charge of INR 80 / USD 1 per order. This will include 60 days of storage, delivery across India covering 18000 pin codes in 48 hours, 20% returns to origin ( RTO ) and at no fixed monthly costs or no minimum orders. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} ( Originally published on Jun 19, 2023 ) Read More News on MAERSK vikash agarwal rto maersk south asia AP MOLLER Maersk India (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

This prediction follows the extreme heatwave conditions observed in several states, including Punjab, Haryana-Chandigarh, Delhi, and Uttar Pradesh. Parts of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, and northern Madhya Pradesh are also experiencing similar conditions. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Widespread Heatwave Conditions The IMD noted that nighttime temperatures have remained warm to severely warm in parts of Punjab, Haryana-Chandigarh, Delhi, UP, and some areas of Rajasthan and Bihar. Maximum temperatures in the plains of North India ranged between 44-46 degrees Celsius, exceeding normal by 5-8 degrees Celsius. Prayagraj recorded the highest temperature at 47.6 degrees Celsius. WHO Guidelines for Heat Protection Amid this extreme heat, the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines to help the public stay safe: Stay Out of the Heat ➤ Avoid outdoor activities and strenuous exercises during the hottest part of the day. ➤ Stay in the shade, as perceived temperatures in the sun can be 10-15°C higher. ➤ Spend 2-3 hours in a cool place daily. You Might Also Like: Severe heat wave conditions persist over parts of Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Chandigarh: Met Department ➤ Be cautious of drowning risks and avoid swimming alone. ➤ Stay informed about official heat warnings. Keep Your Home Cool ➤ Use night air to cool your home by opening windows after dark. ➤ During the day, keep windows closed and covered with blinds or shutters. ➤ Turn off as many electrical devices as possible. ➤ Use electric fans only when temperatures are below 40°C. At higher temperatures, fans can heat the body. You Might Also Like: Delhi likely to see rain in next 3-4 days: IMD ➤ If using air conditioning, set the thermostat to 27°C and use an electric fan to make the room feel cooler while saving on electricity. Keep Your Body Cool and Hydrated ➤ Wear light and loose-fitting clothing and bed linens. ➤ Take cool showers or baths. ➤ Wet your skin with a damp cloth, spray, or wet light clothing. ➤ Drink water regularly, aiming for one cup per hour and at least 2-3 liters per day. ➤ Check regularly on vulnerable individuals, especially those over 65 or with heart, lung, or kidney conditions. You Might Also Like: Delhi heat index crosses 50 as IMD issues red alert. When heatwave in north India will ease Protect Infants and Children ➤ Never leave children or animals in parked vehicles, as temperatures can become dangerously high quickly. ➤ Avoid direct sun exposure during peak hours and seek shade or stay indoors. ➤ Do not cover an infant stroller with dry fabric; use a wet, thin cloth instead, and combine with a portable fan for cooling. ➤ Dress children in lightweight, loose-fitting clothing that covers their skin, and use wide-brimmed hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Following these guidelines can help mitigate the risks posed by the ongoing severe heatwave conditions across the affected regions. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel ) Read More News on delhi heatwave heatwave heat safety tips heatwave safety heatwave who heatwave tips noida heatwave ghaziabad heatwave gurgaon heatwave himachal heat wave (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "Getty Images The 8th Central Pay Commission — should be implemented from January 1, 2026 The Centre has received another proposal to immediately constitute the Eighth Pay Commission to revise the basic pay, allowances, pension and other benefits of the central government employees and pensioners. In a letter addressed to the Cabinet Secretary, Government of India, Shiv Gopal Mishra, Secretary, National Council (staff side, Joint Consultive Machinery for central government employees), pointed out why the central government should form the 8th Pay Commission on priority. Read what he has said in his letter. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} What is a pay commission? A central pay commission is typically constituted at intervals of ten years. The pay commission examines the current pay structure, allowances, and benefits of the central government employees and recommends the changes that need to be made, keeping in mind external factors such as inflation. The Seventh Pay Commission was formed by former Primer Minister Manmohan Singh on February 28, 2014. It submitted its report on November 19, 2015, and the recommendations of the 7th CPC came into effect on January 1, 2016. When will the 8th Pay Commission be constituted and implemented? Since there is a gap of ten years between the two pay commissions, the next pay commission — the 8th Central Pay Commission — should be implemented from January 1, 2026. The Centre has not made any official announcement regarding the constitution of the 8th Central Pay Commission. As the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 is now over and Modi 3.0 is back at the Centre, over 1 crore central government employees are eagerly waiting for the latest update on the Eighth Central Pay Commission. Why is there an urgent need for the 8th Pay Commission? Read the letter Mishra claimed that the Centre earlier said that the inflation was in the range of 4% to 7% and it would be around 5.5% on average. \"The post-COVID inflation is higher than pre covid levels. If we compare the retail prices of essential commodities and goods which are required for daily life from 2016 to 2023 they have increased by over 80% as per the local market, but we are provided only around 46% Dearness Allowance as of 1/7/2023. Hence there is a gap between the actual price rise and DA provided to the employees and pensioners,\" as per the letter. \"The central government revenue has also doubled from the year 2015 to 2023 as per the budget statements we can notice a considerable increase in the revenue collection. The central government’s actual revenue has increased by over 100%. Hence the central government has more paying capacity compared to the year 2016. The GST collection has also increased in April 2023 Rs 1.87 lakh crores has been collected. Income tax collections were highest in the year 2022-23. The gross Personal Income Tax collection (including STT) (provisional) in FY 2022-23 is at Rs. 9,60,764 crore and has shown a growth of 24.23% over the preceding year,\" Mishra said. \"India’s indirect tax collections rose 7.21% in 2022-23 to 13.82 lakh crore from 12.89 lakh crore in the previous year. Source Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC). The Budget estimate for the year 2023-24, revenue collection is expected to be Rs 33,60,858 crore, gross revenue in 2022-23 was Rs 30,43,067 crores. After state shares net central government's actual revenue was Rs 20,86,661 crore. The staff strength of central government employees has decreased in the last decade with about 10 lakh vacancies. The work pressure is on the existing employees,\" according to the letter. Moreover, the number of central government employees has decreased sharply in the last decade with about 10 lakh vacancies. \"The work pressure is on the existing employees,\" Mishra said. He said, \"The actual expenses for wages (salary) and allowances are only 7.29% of the total revenue expenditure for the central government employees for the year 2020-21. In respect of pensioners the actual expenses on pension is around 4% of the total revenue expenditure.\" Demand to review the pay matrix of the central govt employees periodically Further, Mishra said, \"It is also recommended that the matrix may be reviewed periodically without waiting for the long period of ten years. It can be reviewed and revised on the basis of the Aykroyd formula which takes into consideration the changes in prices of the commodities that constitute a common man’s basket, which the Labour Bureau at Shimla reviews periodically. It is suggested that this should be made the basis for revision of that matrix periodically without waiting for another Pay Commission.\" No decision on restoring the Old Pension Scheme yet \"The government so far neither accepted the above recommendations nor constituted the 8th Central Pay Commission. DA of the central government employees and Pensioners have already reached 50% w.e.f. 01.01.2024 the DA element will cross 50% considering the inflation and the price rise. It is also pertinent to mention here that more than 20 lakh civilian central government employees are governed under the National Pension System and every month they have to contribute 10% of their basic pay and DA to the NPS. This considerably reduces their take-home pay. The government has so far not agreed to our demand to scrap NPS and to restore the Pension under CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972 (now 2021) to the central government Employees recruited on or after 01.01.2004,\" the letter said. \"Considering all the above aspects and today’s requirement of life and also to attract qualified and talented candidates to the Government service time has now come to immediately constitute the 8th Central Pay Commission and to revise the pay scales/allowances/pension and other benefits of the central government employees through mutual discussions and settlements. Therefore, the staff side demands that the government of India may immediately constitute the 8th Central Pay Commission,\" the letter concluded. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} ( Originally published on Jun 18, 2024 ) Read More News on 8th Pay Commission 8th pay commission update 8th pay commission latest news 8th pay commission date 7th pay matrix 8th pay commission salary structure central govt employees central govt pensioners (Catch all the Personal Finance News , Breaking News , Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "ETMarkets.com Bharat Petroleum Corporation ( BPCL ) had announced June 22 as the record date for its 1:1 bonus share issuance. Today is the last day to buy shares to qualify for receiving the company's bonus shares. In May, BPCL announced that it would issue bonus shares to eligible shareholders in a 1:1 ratio. This means that for every share held, shareholders will receive one additional share in their Demat account. The company intends to issue a total of 216.92 crore shares as bonuses, resulting in the company's equity share capital standing at Rs 4,338.50 crore. The bonus shares are expected to be credited to shareholders' accounts by July 8, as per a previous filing with the stock exchanges. The state-run oil marketing company’s board has also recommended a final dividend of Rs 21 per equity share (pre-bonus), with a face value of Rs 10 each, for the year 2023-24. This translates into a final dividend of Rs 10.5 per share (post-bonus) of the same face value. For the quarter ended March 2024, BPCL reported a 35% drop in its standalone net profit at Rs 4,224 crore, while revenue from operations fell marginally to Rs 1.32 lakh crore against Rs 1.33 lakh crore posted in the same quarter of previous fiscal. Shares of BPCL have gained 68.2% in the last year and in the last two weeks alone, the stock has gained 7.20%. On Thursday, BPCL shares had closed nearly 1.7% higher at Rs 626.30 on BSE.

    "article_content": "AFP Lazy investors ’ easy way to profit is to pile on to the `likes’ of companies that are successful in their area of business. Globally, the popular theme playing out these days is the chip , memory chip! Nvidia’s rise to the top of the market capitalisation pile has brought in its share of enthusiasts and skeptics. Its eye-popping market value topping $3.3 trillion — towering above Microsoft, Apple and everything else from Walmart to Meta and Alphabet (Google) — is making investors search for the next Nvidia . That’s a natural investor trait. The growth of Nvidia is nothing short of a dream. It has prompted seasoned investors to draw parallel to Cisco Systems of the dotcom bubble that became the darling of investors in the internet age to see its valuations erode when earnings reality dawned. To be sure, Nvidia, with its chips, is at the heart of the current technology revolution – Artificial Intelligence. Its chips are the most sought after by companies to turn mines of data into meaningful explanations to enhance businesses. That scramble for Nvidia’s chips led to the tripling of its revenue in the last quarter to $26 billion compared to a year earlier. No wonder the stock has also tripled in value in the past 12 months, and a trillion-dollar value — equivalent of 7 (yes, 7!) HDFC Banks — was added in just about four months. Many investors have capitalised on the boom in US tech stocks, thanks to the mutual fund plans that invest in overseas companies. But those who did not, appear to have caught on to a locally listed stock that has been into semiconductors, and was backed by private equity firms early in its life. That is Moschip Technologies Ltd. , which says it is into “semiconductor and system design services”. On Wednesday, Moschip was up 13 percent at Rs. 231.35, giving it a market capitalisation of Rs. 4,700 crore and more than 7 million shares changing hands on the BSE. That translates into more than 21 times its last year revenues. It is also notable that the company in a recent regulatory filing said it had secured an order worth Rs 509.37 crore from the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC). It involves the development of a high-performance computing SoC, or System on a Chip, using 5 nanometer technology that could open up opportunities. While the craze over Nvidia continues, thanks to its applications in the emerging AI businesses, there are also examples around how some of the technology companies are fading away as they lagged behind in research and development. Intel, that was the most popular among chip makers for decades, has been at the receiving end. It is down 12 percent for the year and 40 percent from its peak as it struggles to keep pace with the industry demands. In no other field, developments happen as fast as it does in technology. “As Intel approached its 50th anniversary in 2018, decay had set in,” wrote Chris Miller in Chip War. “Innovation happened elsewhere.” This is an industry where even the likes of Intel are struggling and the stars of yesteryears such as Texas Instruments are out of reckoning. It is keeping abreast of the developments that provide valuation edge to technology companies and Nvidia is in the front because it is catering to the industries that are considered to be the future. Indian investors attempting to capitalise on an investment theme by riding on companies that are in similar businesses but that remotely echo that of Nvidia, may be in for a rude shock when reality dawns. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} (You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel ) Read More News on Nvidia chip investors market capitalisation semiconductor Moschip Technologies Ltd.

While this represents a decrease from the 5,100 who left in 2023, India remains one of the top countries for high-net-worth individual (HNWI) departures globally.

The UAE is expected to attract a record net inflow of 6,700 wealthy migrants in 2024, bolstered by its zero income tax policy, golden visa programs, luxurious lifestyle, and strategic location. Sunita Singh-Dalal, Partner at Hourani in Dubai, said, “The evolution and development of the UAE’s wealth management ecosystem is unprecedented. In less than five years, the UAE has introduced a robust regulatory framework that provides the wealthy with a range of innovative solutions to protect, preserve, and enhance their wealth.” Indians are among the top nationalities driving the demand for residence and citizenship by investment programs.

(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates) Global Wealth Migration Trends Dominic Volek, Group Head of Private Clients at Henley & Partners, highlights 2024 as a pivotal year for global wealth migration. “An unprecedented 128,000 millionaires are expected to relocate worldwide this year, eclipsing the previous record of 120,000 set in 2023. This great millionaire migration signals a profound shift in the global landscape, with far-reaching implications for both the countries they leave and those they move to,” he says. Other top destinations for migrating millionaires include the United States, Singapore, Canada, and Australia. These countries are projected to see significant net inflows of wealthy individuals, benefiting from the economic contributions and job creation that HNWIs often bring. Why are people moving out of India? The outflow of millionaires from India is driven by a combination of factors, including the search for better lifestyles, safer environments, and access to premium health and education services. Dr. Hannah White OBE, Director and CEO of the Institute for Government in London, points out that economic and political stability are crucial in retaining HNWIs. Other significant outflows are expected from China, the UK, South Korea, Brazil, South Africa, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Nigeria. Each country faces unique challenges that influence their millionaire migration patterns. The migration of millionaires has significant economic implications. “Migrating millionaires are a vital source of forex revenue as they tend to bring their money with them when they move to a country. Also, around 20% of them are entrepreneurs and company founders who may start new businesses and therefore create local jobs in their new country, and this percentage rises to over 60% for centi-millionaires and billionaires,” Andrew Amoils, Head of Research at New World Wealth, said. As global wealth migration trends continue to evolve, countries with favorable policies for HNWIs are poised to benefit the most. Henley & Partners’ report underscores the importance of these initiatives in attracting and retaining global wealth. India's position in the global wealth migration landscape highlights the need for policies that foster economic stability and growth. As wealthy individuals seek better opportunities abroad, countries like the UAE, USA, and Portugal offer attractive options through investment migration programs. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on millionaires wealth migration India UAE investment migration rich indians moving abroad (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "F&O Income May Face Lottery-Like Taxation in New Budget: Report Worried about hyperactive retail traders losing tons of money in the derivatives market, the government is said to be considering a proposal to impose higher income tax on futures and options (F&O) by treating it akin to income from lottery or cryptocurrencies in the Union Budget , according to a report. The government is considering adjustments to the tax treatment of F&O transactions by reclassifying it from 'business income' to 'speculative income' and even imposing a TDS, Financial Express reported. Being planned to curb retail participation in the derivatives market, the change will mean that F&O income may start getting the same tax treatment as lotteries and cryptocurrencies. Currently, income from F&O transactions is treated as business income and taxed according to income slabs of 5%, 20%, and 30%. The existing classification also allows gains from F&O to be offset against losses from other business activities. Applying TDS to F&O would allow the government to track investors in the market more effectively and also deter frequent trading, according to the report. There are also speculations in the market that the Budget may impose a 30% tax, similar to crypto investments, on F&O income. This regulatory scrutiny arises amidst concerns from various stakeholders, including the government, regulators, exchanges, and fund houses, over the sharp rise in retail trading volumes within the derivatives market. About a month ago, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman commented on the issue, signaling potential policy changes. \"Any unchecked explosion in retail trading in F&O can create future challenges not just for the markets, but for investor sentiment and also for household finances,\" Sitharaman had stated. Earlier this week, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said volumes in the derivatives market are perhaps larger than the nominal GDP of India. \"The early warning group is monitoring that. Sebi and the Reserve Bank, together we are monitoring that...Sebi has taken a few measures and they are examining it and I think they will deal with it,\" Das said at ET Now Leadership Dialogues on Tuesday. Out of the 108 billion options contracts traded worldwide last year, 78% were from Dalal Street where retailers make up 35% of derivative trading. The derivatives turnover on the NSE has surged 30 times from Rs 247.5 lakh crore in March 2020 to Rs 7,218 lakh crore in March 2024. In the meantime, Sebi is said to be considering a series of tweaks to its derivative trading rules to address risks arising from an explosive growth in options trading. The new rules could include higher margins for options contracts and more detailed disclosures and are being considered after a series of meetings with exchanges, brokers, and fund houses over the past four months, according to a report by Reuters . #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} (You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel ) ( Originally published on Jun 20, 2024 ) In Video: F&O Income May Face Lottery-Like Taxation in New Budget: Report Read More News on budget union budget tax news f&o income tax derivate tax (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "Hindujas found guilty of exploiting servants at Geneva Villa; Swiss court sentences four members A Swiss criminal court on Friday sentenced four members of the wealthy Hinduja family with between four and 4 1/2 years in prison for exploiting their vulnerable domestic workers. The court at the same time threw out the more severe charges of human trafficking . #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} The four — Indian-born tycoon Prakash Hinduja and his wife, son and daughter-in-law — were accused of trafficking of their servants , mostly illiterate Indians, who were employed at their luxurious lakeside villa in Geneva. The four were not in court in Geneva though a fifth defendant — Najib Ziazi, the family’s business manager — was in attendance. He received an 18 months suspended sentence. The court said the four were guilty of exploiting workers and providing unauthorized employment. It dismissed the trafficking charges on the grounds that the staff understood what they were getting into. The four Hinduja family members were accused of seizing workers’ passports, paying them in rupees – not Swiss francs — barring them from leaving the villa and forcing them to work excruciatingly long hours for a pittance in Switzerland, among other things.

Geneva prosecutors opened the case for alleged illegal activity including exploitation, human trafficking and violation of Swiss labor laws. The family set up residence in Switzerland decades ago, and Prakash was already convicted in 2007 on similar, if lesser charges, though prosecutors say he persisted in employing people without proper paperwork anyway. Hinduja family responds to judgment: \"We are appalled and disappointed by the rest of the decision made in this court of first instance, and we have of course filed an appeal to the higher court thereby making this part of the judgement not effective. Under Swiss law, the presumption of innocence is paramount till a final judgement by the highest adjudicating authority is enforced,\" said the family in a media statement.

It should also be recalled that the plaintiffs in this case had withdrawn their respective complaints after declaring to the court that they had never intended to be involved in such proceedings, it added. \"The family has full faith in the Judicial Process and remains confident that the truth will prevail. Advocates Yael Hayat and Robert Assael and Romain Jordan representing Prakash Hinduja, Kamal Hinduja, Ajay Hinduja and Namrata Hinduja.\" 'Family spent more on pet dog than they paid a help' According to Swiss prosecutor Yves Bertossa, the family allegedly spent more money on their pet dog than they paid one of their servants. Bertossa presented this information during a trial concerning the alleged trafficking and exploitation of the Indian employees. On Monday, the prosecutor had delivered a scathing critique of the Hinduja family's actions recommending jail sentences ranging up to five and a half years for those involved. Bertossa's arguments were based on testimonies provided by the staff and the Hindujas themselves, as well as evidence gathered during his investigation into the matter. \"They spent more for one dog than one of their servants,\" he said. The woman, he said, was paid at one point as little as 7 Swiss francs ($7.84) for a working day that lasted as long as 18 hours, seven days a week. He pointed to a budget document headlined \"Pets\", which he said demonstrated that the family spent 8,584 Swiss francs in a year on their family dog. Staff contracts didn't specify working hours or days off, but rather that they be available as needed by their employers, Bertossa continued. Given their passports had been confiscated, they had no Swiss francs to spend as wages were paid in India and couldn't leave the house without their employer's permission, they had little to no freedom, he argued. Swiss authorities have already seized diamonds, rubies, a platinum necklace and other jewelry and assets from the family in anticipation that they could be used to pay for legal fees and possible penalties. Prosecutors said that at times the staffers — in jobs like cooks or house help — were forced to work up to 18 hours a day with little or no vacation time off and for pay that was equal to less than one-tenth of the comparable amount required under Swiss law. Employees worked even later hours for receptions and slept in the basement of the villa in the upscale Cologny neighborhood — sometimes on a mattress on the floor, prosecutors said. They described a “climate of fear” instituted by Kamal Hinduja. Some employees allegedly spoke only Hindi and were paid their wages in Indian rupees in banks back home that they couldn't access. A separate tax case brought by Swiss authorities is pending against Prakash Hinduja, who obtained Swiss citizenship in 2000. Along with three brothers, he is a leader of an industrial conglomerate in sectors including information technology, media, power, real estate and health care. Forbes magazine currently puts the net worth of the Hinduja family at some $20 billion.

The amount is based on the revenue estimation ahead of the presentation of the FY25 budget. The Centre is yet to take a final call on the use of this extra cess amount, but officials expect the issue to resonate in the GST Council meeting on Saturday when discussion begins on rate rationalisation. Road Map for Cess Collection: At the 52nd GST Council meeting in October 2023, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the body may decide on the road map for cess collection after March 2026 when the levy ends. The Centre had promised a 14% CAGR in tax revenue to states for five years from the date of GST rollout -- July 1, 2017. Any shortfall was to be made up through collections from the compensation cess. This compensation to states ended in June 2022 after the completion of five years but was extended till March 31, 2026, to repay the interest and principal on the Rs 2.69 lakh crore that the Centre had borrowed during the Covid period to meet the deficit in the cess fund. The deadline was set based on collections trends in the first five years, but cess collections have grown faster than assumed on the back of robust GST collections. GST cess collection was Rs 12,284 crore in May, which included Rs 1,076 crore collected on imported goods. The Centre collected Rs 1.45 lakh crore from the cess in FY24. In the interim budget, it had set the FY25 target at Rs 1.5 lakh crore. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel ) Read More News on GST meet GST GST news GST meet news GST meet decisons GST meet 2024 GST compensation cess sin goods GST Council Nirmala Sitharaman (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "Getty Images Karnataka is preparing a feasibility study for setting up a second airport for Bengaluru. Karnataka infrastructure development minister MB Patil has instructed officials to prepare a feasibility report for a second commercial airport in the city, considering the future needs of Bengaluru. During a meeting with key department officials, Patil discussed the necessity of a new airport to support the rapidly growing metropolis. Present at the meeting were N Manjula, secretary of the infrastructure development department, BC Satish, managing director of Karnataka Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation, and DP Prakash, executive director. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Why second Bengaluru airport Patil pointed out that Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) is the third-busiest airport in India, handling 3.7 crore passengers and over 4 lakh tonnes of cargo last year. Given this substantial traffic, the minister emphasized the need for a second airport to manage future growth. When KIA was established, Bangalore International Airport Ltd (BIAL) agreed with the government to maintain a 150km radius exclusivity for 25 years, which will expire in 2033. With only nine years left on this agreement, planning for a second airport has become imperative. — MBPatil (@MBPatil) The city's population has surpassed 10 million, and it hosts numerous global companies. KIA also serves surrounding districts and parts of Andhra Pradesh. By 2033, KIA is expected to reach its maximum passenger capacity, with freight volumes peaking by 2040. In 2020, the Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce (BCIC) urged the government to establish a new airport. They highlighted that the existing airport would reach its full capacity by 2030. A second airport would enhance competition, connectivity, and affordability, while also promoting inclusive development in the rapidly growing southern and southwestern regions of Bengaluru, particularly along the Bengaluru-Mysore highway.

The Tumakuru-Chitradurga stretch is one of the potential locations, a TOI report said last year. Patil mentioned that the state is in the early stages of identifying suitable locations for the new airport, drawing inspiration from cities like Mumbai and Goa, which have successfully implemented multiple airports. If allowed as a second airport in the same city, the distribution of traffic between the two airports must be clearly defined. Patil had earlier stressed the importance of assessing air-traffic viability for airports near the proposed second airport in Bengaluru. The chosen location must offer sufficient land for a fully functional airport and allow for future expansion. While the reopening of the old HAL airport was initially considered, concerns about limited space for growth led the government to explore alternative options. The proposals are being examined in the Tumakuru-Chitradurga stretch, though several locations are deemed unviable due to potential expansions, or traffic considerations.

    "article_content": "ET Bureau Every once in a while, there occurs an event in the life of institutions that shakes up carefully built reputations and raises questions on their governance and integrity. National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE) managing director and chief executive officer Chitra Ramkrishna’s resignation was one such moment. That it came close on the heels of the publicly unknown, yet forced exit of the NSE group’s chief operating officer, Subramanian Anand, adds to the mystery. Despite these high-profile exits, conflicts of interest continue to plague the exchange, which is preparing for a mega initial public offering that could value it at $2-3 billion. Set up in 1992 to check the near-monopoly of the Bombay Stock Exchange, which was hit by a share scam, the NSE hides governance failures that may even have put market integrity at risk. An allegation that the exchange gave preferential access to highfrequency traders is yet to be disposed of. ET spoke to a number of people at the NSE, including current and previous directors. The story that emerges reeks of hubris, favouritism, disregard for corporate governance and a casual approach to institutional processes. First Among Equals Minister of State for Finance Arjun Meghwal told the Parliament on December 9 that markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) had found the NSE to have given some stock brokers preferential access to its servers. Also Read: Listing should not be hostage to NSE restructuring, says Chairman Ashok Chawla \"Preferential access was given to stock broker(s), wherein it was possible for a stock broker to log into multiple dissemination servers through multiple internet protocols assigned to him,\" said Meghwal, quoting from the Sebi report. The market regulator had probed the allegations after the NSE absolved itself in its own investigation. An insider who read the NSE inquiry report called it \"perfunctory.\" Sebi then asked NSE to appoint an independent entity. It chose Deloitte India to conduct a forensic inquiry. Deloitte submitted its report to the board on December 13. Ravi Narain was present in the board meeting and did not recuse himself from the discussion even though allegations refer to a period when he was managing director and CEO —a clear conflict of interest. Narain did not respond to ET’s queries. \"Neither the complaint nor the report attributes anything to Mr Ravi Narain. As such there is no bar on his participating in the board discussions relating to the matter,\" an NSE spokesperson wrote to ET. NSE also appears to have overlooked a conflict of interest in the appointment of Deloitte as forensic auditors. Two NSE officials told ET on condition of anonymity that Deloitte had just completed a business continuity project for NSE, which required them to go through the same systems that it subjected to forensic audit . The second stage of the project—for ISO certification—had been kept on hold. \"Big institutions like NSE deal with multiple management consultants for different purposes from time to time. Each such agency has its own Chinese wall concept and conflict management mechanism. In the current case too, there were checks to ensure there are no conflicts in respect of appointment of the forensic agency,\" said the NSE spokesperson. It did not respond to ET’s question whether the management informed the board of Deloitte’s previous assignment. A board member said it had not. NSE started offering co-location to algorithmic traders or high-frequency traders in 2010. High frequency traders use sophisticated computer algorithms to exploit minute price differences that flash past in fractions of a second. That also means traders whose servers are located close to the exchange’s have a minuscule time advantage over others located farther as price information takes that much more time to travel over communication networks. In January 2015, a whistleblower wrote to Sebi and financial journalist and editor of MoneyLife magazine Sucheta Dalal describing how NSE was giving preferential treatment to some traders by helping them connect to its servers ahead of others. Bypassing Regulations On October 5, 2012, at 9.50 am, the NSE’s 50-share index Nifty crashed over 900 points. The crash was later attributed to a \"fat finger\" or an erroneous data entry by a trader who punched in the volume instead of the price. But the fall in the index automatically triggered the circuit breakers and the market was shut down. Sebi regulations require that such a shutdown should remain for two hours. NSE, however, started trading in about 15 minutes. After the market shut, the then finance minister, P Chidambaram, called Narain on the phone and soon after, the exchange reopened. \"The goal was always to resume trading after a short shutdown. Everyone was on the same page,\" Chidambaram told ET via a text message. When ET pointed out that it violated Sebi guidelines, he replied that the Sebi chairman was on board. Sebi chief UK Sinha did not respond to calls and text messages to his mobile phone seeking comment. Sebi’s investigation into the incident did not find any communication between the exchange and the regulator. In an October 2014 order, it censured NSE for endangering the market. Wholetime member Prashant Saran wrote that stock exchanges were not at liberty to assess the situation and act according to their assessment. \"It is already observed above that there is no material to indicate that NSE consulted Sebi to cut short the market halt duration and re-open the cash market at 10:00:22. Similarly, there are also no records to show that NSE informed BSE of this. I find that by not bringing coordinated trading halt in all equity and equity derivative markets nationwide, NSE had violated the Sebi Circular and thereby put the securities market at a serious systemic risk,\" Saran wrote. A former NSE board member said, \"That is the problem. Non-written communication is much faster and there is no audit trail.\" He said the exchange felt stopping trade would cause more damage. The Guard Changes Sometime in August this year, the board of directors of the National Stock Exchange — including its new chairman Ashok Chawla and managing director and chief executive (MD-CEO) Chitra Ramkrishna — called on Sebi chairman UK Sinha. The NSE board had just been reconstituted with three new public interest directors—Manipal Global Education Services chairman Mohandas Pai, Dhruva Advisors’ chief executive Dinesh Kanabar and former corporate affairs secretary Naved Masood. As the meeting ended, Sinha flagged an issue that had been bothering the regulator for a while—the appointment and conduct of group COO Subramanian Anand. The regulator as well as NSE’s board members had been receiving anonymous complaints about Anand, whose appointment itself was a mystery. Sinha asked the board to investigate thoroughly. It was also formally communicated to them by the regulator. The board then launched a probe headed by its audit committee chairman, Dinesh Kanabar, a no-nonsense tax expert and former deputy chief executive at KPMG India. What Kanabar unearthed was disturbing, according to three people who have direct knowledge of the probe. The Powerful Advisor Anand first joined NSE on April 1, 2013 as chief strategic advisor to the MD-CEO at an annual fee of about Rs 1.7 crore. Till then, he had been employed in Chennai at logistics firm Transafe Services, a joint venture between the state-owned Balmer Lawrie and the ICICI group at an annual pay of a little over Rs 14 lakh. As CSA to Ramkrishna, who, incidentally, took over as MD-CEO on the same day, he occupied a cabin next to hers. NSE officials say it was made clear that he was practically the no. 2 in the organisation. Anand also had a peculiar arrangement as he worked from both Chennai and Mumbai, where NSE is headquartered, even after he was elevated to group COO exactly two years later, on April 1, 2015. In the letter appointing J Ravichandran (current MD-CEO in charge) as group president and Anand as COO, Ramkrishna wrote, \"I propose to use the facility of our chief strategic advisor to reduce my burden.\" She went on to re-designate him as group COO and advisor to the MD. He was given charge of people management, new business, corporate communication, marketing, business excellence, research and development, pricing, strategic planning and subsidiaries—IISL, DOTEX, NSE Tech and NSE IT. According to a source, the letter was not even made available to company secretaries SN Ananthasubramanian and Co (SNA) for audit. The management is said to have claimed that it was an internal communication. The NSE’s audit committee inquiry found his appointment irregular and him abusing his powers — which one insider termed as \"akin to a managing director’s\" — delegated to him by the board. \"NSE is not just another company. It is a regulator. It should not only behave like one, it should set an example for others,\" said a governance expert who did not want to be named. \"NSE’s compliance was apparent compliance, which means only on paper,\" he said. He was a non-executive director on several group companies. Yet he was not designated as a key management personnel (KMP) in the company’s annual report and his remuneration—Rs 4.25 crore per annum which was second only to Ramkrishna’s salary of Rs 4.78 crore—not disclosed. SNA red-flagged the issue in October 2015 asking why Anand was not recognized as a KMP even though he was designated the group COO. The management replied that he was not a KMP because his was a contractual appointment as a consultant. Former NSE board chairman SB Mathur told ET in an interview at his Delhi residence that none of the secretarial reports placed before the board were qualified and hence there was no reason to suspect anything amiss. Asked whether they qualified secretarial audit report of 2015 and 2016 regarding the COO’s position in the organisation, SN Ananthasubramanian, senior partner at SNA, told ET that they did not. \"During the course of our audits, we had raised queries on certain issues, including the one referred to by you, to which the management responded adequately,\" he said in an email to ET. In its annual report published in August 2016 NSE again omitted Anand as a KMP. This time, the company secretaries wrote to the company saying that Anand being the group COO with executive powers had to be treated as an employee and a KMP. Consultants are generally appointed on contract for specific purposes or for a fixed tenure, with specific powers which could also include executive powers of management. When deviations are made from this, such an appointment could be construed as employment in substance and will require compliance with the requisite laws,\" Ananthasubramanian said in his email. The NSE board met in the third week of October over video conference to review the enquiry report. The verdict was unanimous. He had to go. The board met again the next day where Chitra was also present and was told in unambiguous terms that Anand had to leave, instantly. Within an hour the group COO of NSE foreclosed his contracts and left office. ET could not reach Anand for comments and left a questionnaire for him at his Chennai home. There was no response at the time of going to press. ET interviewed NSE chairman Ashok Chawla at the India Habitat Centre office of TERI where too he serves as chairman. Chawla declined to discuss Anand’s exit, merely saying that he left on his own. He also said that Ramkrishna and Anand leaving will not materially affect NSE’s IPO process. NSE’s audit committee chairman, Dinesh Kanabar, who conducted the probe, declined to comment. In an email reply to ET’s questionnaire, Ramkrishna wrote, \"The pointers in your questionnaire are baseless and do not warrant any comments from me. These pointers have already been the subject of speculative pieces in the last week and may I add only end up distorting the image of a prestigious organisation that I hold very high and close to my heart.\" Appointment Without Process In October 2012, days after the \"fat finger crash,\" Ravi Narain, then MD-CEO of NSE, informed the board that he intended to quit at end of March 2013. The board suggested starting the process of looking for a new chief but Narain insisted there was no need to look outside as there could not be a more qualified person than Ramkrishna. \"We brought up the issue of succession planning several times but the management never did (plan),\" SB Mathur, former chairman of NSE board told ET in an interview at his Delhi residence. On November 6, 2012, the board constituted a four-person selection committee with Narain also as a member. It decided that an internal candidate was best suited for the job. The organisation was so sure about Ramkrishna that it did not even advertise for the job. Incidentally, NSE wrote to Sebi seeking approval for the appointment on December 13, 2012, the same day that the regulator issued a circular on ownership and governance of exchanges. It required them to issue advertisements inviting candidates for the position. Sebi approved Ramkrishna’s appointment because NSE had already completed the selection. Almost immediately, MD-CEO in waiting Ramkrishna appointed Anand as CSA with effect from April 1, 2013, the day she would take over the reins from Narain. \"In hindsight, we could have done better (in terms of process). But there were no two opinions that Chitra was the best choice,\" former chairman Mathur said. NSE then proposed to appoint Narain as a public interest director (PID) and vice-chairman of the exchange even though there was no such position. SEBI received several complaints as well as a legal notice opposing the plan. Only PIDs are allowed to chair board committees. NSE then changed the proposal to vice-chairman and director representing shareholders, which SEBI cleared. Ravi Narain and Chitra Ramkrishna as well as J Ravichandran, who is currently MD-CEO in charge, were part of NSE’s founding team. Narain occupied the chief executive’s chair after RH Patil, NSE’s founding chairman. Within a few years, NSE, with its electronic trading platform overtook BSE. The exchange now enjoys a near complete monopoly in stock derivatives trade. It ranked fourth globally on number of trades executed in calendar year 2015. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on audit sebi Monopoly Whistleblower Derivatives circuit breakers Duration IPO Education Market (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "Sandeep Wagle , Founder & MD, APTART Technical Advisory Services , aptartindia.com in an interview with ET Now talks about the market outlook. What is the call on markets right now? I am not that bearish as I was couple of days back and having said that with some bit of certainty that the range for the Nifty is now capped at 5500 to 5700, nearer 5550-5580. I would like to buy nearer 5700 or would like to sell as in not to short but book profits. Bank Nifty is showing a lot of strength and Bank Nifty will lead the market at the Nifty. That is the main reason where I am not getting into a short sell mode or selling this thing. Yes, if you have bought at lower levels, some profit booking is prudent at maybe nearer 5700 but I see Bank Nifty outperforming and I do not see the Nifty crashing down from current levels. I would take a bullish bias for the next couple of days and a stock specific view. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Sandeep Wagle APTART Technical Advisory Services Bank Nifty (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "ET Bureau NEW DELHI: Despite benchmark indices touching their all-time high levels, experts are advising stock investors against going short at this juncture. “The market is overbought and moving towards an overstretched position. But short selling at this juncture could be very risky,” says Puneet Kinra , AVP, Research ( equity technicals) at Bonanza Portfolio. Analysts expect the current upsurge in stock prices to continue till the actual poll results are announced on May 16. “Markets have run up quite a bit and there may be an intermediate correction after the poll results. But till then, the upside is unlimited,” says Kinra. “We remain bullish on the markets but HNIs with large portfolios should hedge them with put options,” says Chetan Jain , derivative analyst, Anand Rathi . Apart from buying puts to guard against a potential drop in stock prices, a Butterfly Spread can yield good returns for investors in the coming days while capping the loss. Jain has suggested clients to sell 7000 calls and puts. The 7000 call will fetch a premium of roughly Rs 285 while the 7000 put will fetch around Rs 245. At the same time, the investor should buy a 7500 call for Rs 90 and a 6500 put for Rs 90. “The total inflow is Rs 530, while the outflow is Rs 180. So the investor pockets Rs 350 premium,” says Jain. That is The strategy will yield best results if the Nifty remains flat at around 7000 till the expiry date on 29 May. In case the NDA comes to power with a thumping majority as claimed by Nerendra Modi and the Nifty zooms, the 7000 call will lead to losses. But the 7500 call will cap this loss. On the other hand, if the NDA doesn’t get a majority and the Nifty crashes, the 7000 put will go into loss. Here again, the 6500 put will limit the loss. “The maximum loss is capped at Rs 7,500 (Rs 150 x 50) while the maximum profit from the strategy is Rs 17,500 (Rs 350 x 50),” says Jain. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Chetan Jain lead markets nifty premium benchmark Anand Rathi Puneet Kinra net worth Insurability (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "PTI MUMBAI: The benchmark BSE Sensex tanked 538.12 points, its worst single-day drop this year, to slip below 27,000-mark while the wider Nifty crashed below 8,100 level due to capital outflows amid weak economic data and sharp falls in global markets. A weakening rupee which slumped to a 13-month low and tumbling global markets on renewed concerns over growth as crude oil prices crahsed to fresh multi-years low, accelerated selling activity on the bourses, brokers said. Meanwhile, the rupee tumbled by 64 paise, or 1 per cent, to hit a 13-month low of 63.58 against the dollar (intra-day). Globally, Brent crude slumped to nearly USD 59 for the first time since 2009. The 30-share Sensex closed at 26,781.44 points, down by 538.12 points, or 1.97 per cent. Today's drop is the biggest since September 3, 2013 when the BSE index tumbled by 651 points. After cracking the 8,100-mark, the NSE Nifty touched the day's low of 8,052.60 before settling down by 152 points, or 1.85 per cent, at 8,067.60. India's trade deficit widened to one-and-a-half year high of USD 16.86 billion in November due to over six-fold jump in gold imports even as exports grew by 7.27 per cent. Among the Sensex constituents, 27 ended lower. Sesa Sterlite was the biggest loser among 30 Sensex stocks. It slumped by 7.77 pc, followed by Dr Reddy (6.32 pc), Hindalco (5.67 pc) and SBI (4.66 pc). The stocks of Tata Power (4.59 pc), ICICI Bank (4.30 pc) NTPC (3.20 pc), ITC Ltd (3.13 pc), Tata Steel (2.82 pc) and HDFC Ltd (3.11 pc) also dropped. A weak Asian trend after data showed industrial acitivity is contracting in China and lower opening in Europe dampened the trading sentiments, brokers said. Foreign Portfolio Investors sold shares worth a net Rs 455.72 crore yesterday as per provisional data. The BSE small-cap index lost 3.36 per cent and the mid-cap index fell 2.96 per cent. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Rupee Sensex BSE NSE nifty (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "PTI MUMBAI: Equities across the globe came under intense selling pressure today and the Indian market was no exception as the benchmark BSE Sensex plunged 242 points to 27,366.07, its lowest closing in over two months. At one point, the index was down over 450 points, tracking massive sell-off in other Asian markets after weak factory output data stoked fears about China's slowing economy. US markets overnight ended in deep red too. Besides, escalating tension between South Korea and North Korea and weakness in emerging market currencies too stifled new bets in the domestic market. Consequently, the wider NSE Nifty crashed below the 8,300- mark by tumbling 72.80 points or 0.87 per cent to 8,299.95. Intra-day it moved between 8,225.05 and 8,322.20. Foreign investors also didn't help as they pulled out Rs 1,007.26 crore from local markets yesterday. Meanwhile, the rupee depreciated to a two-year low of 65.91 (intra-day) against the dollar. The BSE Sensex after resuming lower at 27,440.10, continued to slide and touched day's low of 27,131.44. However, it recouped nearly half of early losses in late afternoon on emergence of buying after A P Shah panel on MAT on FIIs recommended giving relief to foreign investors from levy of tax for the period prior to April 1, 2015. Finally, the index settled 241.75 points or 0.88 per cent down at 27,366.07, its lowest closing since June 19. Vedanta was the biggest BSE loser as it slumped 3.81 per cent, followed by Bajaj Auto (3.40%), Hero MotoCorp (2.81%) and GAIL (2.75%). Shares of realty, auto, capital goods, banking, power, oil&gas and metal were among the major laggards of the day. On a weekly basis, the Sensex lost 701.24 points and the NSE Nifty plunged by 218.60 points. Overseas, Key indices in Japan, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were off between 1.53 per cent and 4.27 per cent. Meanwhile, a survey showed that China's factory sector shrank at its fastest rate in more than six years in August. European stocks were trading lower too. US stocks suffered their worst sell-off in 2015 by falling 2.06 per cent in yesterday's trade as markets were buffeted by worries about a slowdown in global growth. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on South Korea Sensex BSE nifty asian markets Bajaj Auto GAIL Taiwan European stocks US markets (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "ET Bureau Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s first budget was unexciting and incremental, rather than radical, providing no fiscal boost to accelerate GDP growth to the 8% target for Modi government 2.0. It was protectionist and inward-looking, seeking to reduce import dependence rather than increasing exports.

It had also waived income tax for individuals earning up to Rs 5 lakh per annum. So this budget was more a supplementary than a full budget. However, with the help of Rs 90,000 crore of excess capital to be transferred from the Reserve Bank of India, plus higher cesses on petrol and diesel, the fiscal deficit came down marginally to 3.3% of GDP. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had revealed last year that the official deficit figure was a fiction, cloaking off-budget borrowing. It remains to be seen whether the fiction will continue this year. Sitharaman pledged bank recapitalisation of Rs 70,000 crore, which should revive lending in a big way. This can boost growth through booming credit rather than loose fiscal policy. The FM says the recapitalisation may be spread over three years, not in one big bang. The Economic Survey on Thursday said that ‘dwarfs’ — companies with less than 100 employees even after 10 years of existence should lose their benefits to new startups. But Sitharaman seeks to help MSMEs in every way, including loans of up to Rs 1 crore within 59 minutes through a dedicated online portal, and faster clearance of government dues to suppliers. Remember, Snow White loved the seven dwarfs. A paradigm shift is the decision to move part of government borrowings to foreign markets. No details are available on the sums for this year or next five years. This could check interest rates in India, so bond markets soared on Friday. Excess liquidity in foreign markets has created negative bond rates in countries such as Germany, so there will never be a better time to borrow abroad cheaply, despite currency risks, to finance domestic investments. But capital spending in the budget goes up only 6%, half the nominal GDP growth rate, so this cannot be called an investment-led strategy. The budget assumes 12% nominal GDP growth, presumably 8% real growth and 4% inflation. But the Economic Survey had projected real GDP growth of only 7%. How has the rate gone up by 1% in one day? If one reduces nominal growth to 11%, many budgetary ratios will go haywire. Former FM Arun Jaitley had promised that India would become competitive vis-à-vis Asian peers in direct tax rates. That has not happened. The promised cut in corporate tax rates to 25% will apply only to companies with a turnover of up to Rs 400 crore, stranding the large companies that are the biggest exporters. Disinvestment Target Ambitious And while India is struggling to get down to the 25% rate, other Asian countries have reduced their effective corporate tax rates to below 20%, rendering us uncompetitive. Soaking the rich may be good socialism, but worsens India’s competitiveness in tax rates. New surcharges will raise the effective income tax rate by 3% and 7%, respectively, for the highest tax brackets above Rs 2 crore and Rs 5 crore. The expectation of higher tax revenues will be eroded by accelerating the flight of billionaires to low-tax countries such as Singapore and Dubai, a most undesirable but rising trend. For the second year in a row, import duties have been raised on a wide range of items — from vinyl flooring and tiles to cameras, optical fibre and books. The FM views this as promoting ‘Make in India’. But this is a vision of uncompetitive production behind high tariffs, not world-class competitive production. The Economic Survey said on Thursday that increasing exports were an essential condition for getting into a virtuous high-growth cycle, but the budget seeks import substitution — the very opposite philosophy that was followed in the first three decades after Independence with disastrous results. Nor is import substitution compatible with efforts to enter into free-trade agreements like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), or with the European Union. The US has abolished preferential GSP tariffs for New Delhi in retaliation against India’s rising import barriers, so import substitution has become a tax on exports, a most unfortunate outcome. To attract more foreign portfolio investments, the FM will ask the Securities and Exchange Board of India to consider raising the minimum free float for listed companies from 25% to 35%. Logically, this should extend to public sector companies too. But they have been exempted for no good reason. To attract FII passive investment in exchange traded funds, the statutory limit for FII investment will be raised from 24% to the sectoral FDI investment limit. This will boost share prices but increase volatility risks as portfolio investment can be hot money. Noting that FDI had risen to $64.4 billion in 2018-19, the FM proposed further opening up of FDI in civil aviation and insurance. FDI of 100% will be allowed in insurance intermediaries. Also, local sourcing norms will be eased for single-brand retail. These are incremental rather than big-bang steps, but nevertheless welcome. Disinvestment aims to mop up Rs 1,05,000 crore, an exceedingly ambitious target. The FM says the whole list of PSUs cleared by the Cabinet for disinvestment will be sold. This includes the sale of brownfield government infrastructure assets worth Rs 24,000 crore. Management control will shift to private buyers, so this will be a form of privatisation. The FM said the government would consider bringing down its shareholding to below 51% in public sector enterprises. This is highly desirable, as it will free companies from the travails of the CVC, CBI and CAG. It could materially improve the share prices too. Startups have been given a boost. The angel tax on supposedly excess share valuation is going to be virtually abolished, ending an extraordinary irritant. The identity and source of funds by investors will be resolved by e-verification, to check laundering of black money through this route. Non banking financial companies (NBFCs) have also been given a lifeline. The government will provide credit guarantee to banks to purchase Rs 1 lakh crore worth of pooled assets of highly rated NBFCs. This will greatly ease the liquidity problems of the sector, and revive their lending to MSMEs. Regulation of NBFCs by the RBI will be strengthened simultaneously to check loose lending practices. Faceless income tax assessments should reduce corruption in tax offices, and promote compliance. Tax scrutiny will be on a completely random basis to check tax harassment. These are welcome steps. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel ) Read More News on union budget budget 2019 Budget analysis Arun Jaitley Nirmala Sitharaman Budget speech budget coverage (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "ET Online and Agencies NEW DELHI: Emkay Global Financial Servies Ltd slipped 10 per cent in trade and was locked in lower circuit on Friday, after the National Stock Exchange (NSE) said the broking firm was responsible for the erroneous trades. At 01:40 pm, Emkay Global was locked in lower circuit at Rs 31.10. The NSE said Emkay had placed 59 erroneous orders that resulted in multiple trades with an aggregate value of over Rs 6.5 billion on behalf of an institutional client. At the NSE, the stock plunged 10 per cent to Rs 31.05. The National Stock Exchange index Nifty crashed 800 points this morning, halting the trade, which the bourse blamed on erroneous orders worth Rs 650 crore by a broker Emkay Global for one of its clients. \"These orders have been entered by a trading member Emkay Global Financial Services on behalf of an institutional client,\" NSE said. \"These non-algo market orders have been entered for an erroneous quantity which resulted in executing trades at multiple price points across the entire order book thereby causing the circuit filter to be triggered. These orders have been identified to a specific dealer terminal,\" it added. The exchange further said, Emkay has closed out the positions arising out of erroneous trades smoothly and the member has been disabled from trading. NSE said the market opened normally today and Nifty opened at 5,815. Nifty circuit filter got triggered at 9.50.58 hours upon which the cash market was closed automatically. The NSE index Nifty crashed 800 points this morning, halting the trade on account of abnormal orders, resulting in multiple trades at low prices. It also impacted the price movements of the BSE index Sensex , leading to its steep fall. At 1304 hrs, the stock markets recovered some of the lost ground and Nifty was trading at 5,747.50, down 40.10 points. The Sensex was down 112.67 points at 18,945.48. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Emkay Global Sensex BSE nifty stock markets Financial Services (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

NEW DELHI: The BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty are likely to open in green on Wednesday following firm global cues. SGX Nifty was trading 98.50 points up at 8213.50, indicating a gap-up start for domestic equity markets. Asian peers Hang Seng and Nikkei indices were trading higher by 0.50 per cent and 0.97 per cent, respectively, in morning trade. On Wall Street , the Dow Jones Industrial Average index advanced 0.29 per cent to a record high on Tuesday while the S&P 500 gained 0.75 per cent. The 30-share Sensex on Tuesday slipped over 514 points to end at nearly 6-month low of 26,305 and the Nifty crashed below 8,200 after fears of acute cash crunch arising out of demonetisation played out amid capital outflows and surging US yields. Milan Vaishnav, CMT, consultant technical analyst, Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services said, “For today, the levels of 8,165 and 8,235 will act as immediate resistance levels on the daily charts.

    "article_content": "ET Bureau MUMBAI : A late recovery in India 's stock markets may have calmed frayed nerves, but frantic phone calls to clients by stock brokers during the first half of trading session for additional margin on market-to-market losses had heightened anxiety levels. “A lot of traders cut their positions in first half of trade,” said Sudip Bandyopadhyay , chairman of Inditrade Capital. “Of course, there is margin pressure. But it may not be as high as seen in January when nobody was prepared for a crash.” The benchmark equity indices Sensex and Nifty crashed by 2.44% and 2.20% on Friday, their biggest fall since January 4 this year. On an intra-day basis while the indices had crashed by close to 4%, they staged a smart recovery after it was noticed that European markets too had gained from their low levels. “Comparatively, this time the margin pressure is very less as clients were risk averse ahead of the major event,” said Devang Kamdar , Sr. Vice President, Sharekhan . “Those having positions are capitalised and well hedged as the event was in sight if not the outcome.” Many complacent trades, who took long positions based on television opinion polls and Satta Bazzar odds were caught on the wrong foot. Most television polls, while called voting on UK’s exit from the European Union a close race, gave ‘Remain’ a lead. Similar was the case with several international betting sites when ‘Remain’ was the hot favourite with an 80% probability to win. This saw global stock markets register more than 2% gains in the past couple of weeks. On Friday, as Brexit became a reality a crash in Asian markets like Japan and Hong Kong by 7.92% and 2.92% created a panic situation. Both Japan and Hong Kong markets commence trading ahead of India. “There was buying frenzy in markets for the last five days but despite Friday’s reality check many traders are still willing to go long,” said Brij Rattan Bagri , Chairman of Delhi based BLB Securities . “Market-to-market losses are there yet not much worry on that part or any margin risk.” #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on satta bazzar Sensex Japan Hong Kong nifty European Union Sudip Bandyopadhyay Sharekhan Brexit BLB Securities (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "Getty Images Just 6 per cent of the stocks on BSE500 managed to deliver positive returns to investors during the week gone by. NEW DELHI: It turned out to be a highly disappointing week for Dalal Street , as benchmark equity indices Sensex and Nifty crashed 7 per cent on fears that the coronavirus outbreak will hit the global economy. The 30-share Sensex lost 2,872.80 points to 38,297 on February 28 against 41,170 on February 20. Likewise, NSE Nifty index declined 879 points to 11201 during the same period. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services , said: “Sentiment has completely turned around in a matter of one week. The market closed out one of the worst weeks in the last decade on fears that coronavirus may turn out to be a bigger threat than what was estimated earlier. This was in the backdrop of infections cropping up in Europe, the Americas and WHO warnings of a global pandemic.” This fear combined with the fact that the market had already run up, has also triggered a risk-off stance among overseas investors, who have emerged as net sellers last week. This downtrend was not just limited to domestic markets, but was in sync with global markets. FIIs offloaded shares worth nearly Rs 10,000 crore during the past four trading sessions. Here are a few stocks, which buzzed the most during the week: You Might Also Like: Top 10 firms lose Rs 3.35 lakh crore in m-cap in a week IPO update SBI Cards and Payment Services’ initial public offer (IPO) of around Rs 10,000 crore will open for subscription on March 2 amid volatile stock market due to deepening concerns over the coronavirus outbreak. For qualified institutional buyers (QIBs), the subscription will close on March 4, while for other segments the issue will end on March 5.

The BSE Auto, Oil & Gas, Realty and other sectoral indices also declined between 4-11 per cent during the period.

As uncertainty about the market ’s direction heightens ahead of the Union Budget on Saturday, analysts suggest traders could use a mix of Nifty options to bet on the event. Volatility Index, or VIX, is at 16.80, it’s the highest level in the last three months. VIX has risen from 10 to 17 in over a month as option premiums have climbed up due to heightened worries about the Budget. Here are some of the strategies analysts are suggesting with the Budget in mind: AMIT GUPTA HEAD-DERIVATIVES, ICICI SECURITIES NIFTY SHOULD move towards 12,500 in the coming weeks. One can adopt the call ratio strategy to ride the gradual upsides with limited risk on declines. In this strategy, 1 lot of Nifty Feb 12,100 call option can be bought at Rs 180-185 and 2 lots of 12,500 Feb Call options can be sold at Rs 50-55. The net premium outflow is approximately Rs 75, which is the maximum loss if the index declines. The strategy gains Rs 325 if it reaches 12,500. The strategy remains profitable till the Nifty reaches 12,825. CHANDAN TAPARIA You Might Also Like: Will Budget 2020 be the inflection point for indices to take off? DERIVATIVES & TECHNICAL ANALYST, MOTILAL OSWAL FINANCIAL SERVICES Scenario 1: Major medium-term trend is positive and expecting a move towards the 12,500-12,600 zone A BULL CALL SPREAD on Nifty monthly options is one of the strategies that traders can play ahead of the upcoming Union Budget. It consists of buying one monthly Feb 12,200 call option at Rs 141 and selling one lot of 12,500 calls at Rs 50. The net premium outflow is Rs 91. Here the breakeven point is 12,291. If the Nifty goes above 12,291, the reward would be Rs 15,675, else the maximum loss is Rs 6,825.

Here the net outflow is Rs 101 and breakeven point is 11,899. If the Nifty goes below 11,899, the gain would be Rs 14,925 with a maximum risk of Rs 7,575 to hedge the downside till 11,700.

    "article_content": "Shutterstock.com Aggregate inflows into equity mutual fund schemes climbed to Rs 11,723 crore during the month, higher than February’s Rs 10,796 crore. Mumbai: “Be greedy when others are fearful” –Warren Buffett advised investors who want to make money consistently in the stock markets. The average Indian savers appear to have heeded the Oracle of Omaha’s advice despite unprecedented carnage on D-Street, remaining steadfast on their long-term goal of building wealth, SIP by SIP. Collections through monthly systematic investment plans (SIP) continued their upward trend and touched an all-time high of Rs 8,641 crore, staying above the Rs 8,000 crore mark for the 16th consecutive month. As per data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), for the first time, SIP collections crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore mark in a financial year to touch Rs 1,00,040 crore. And all this through a manic March, in which Nifty crashed nearly a quarter. “Investors are doing SIPs for the long term to meet their financial goals. Over the years, they have evolved and have faith in the markets,” said DP Singh, executive director, SBI Mutual Fund . Aggregate inflows into equity mutual fund schemes climbed to Rs 11,723 crore during the month, higher than February’s Rs 10,796 crore. These inflows are the highest in the past 12 months.

However, the average industry assets for March fell by Rs 3.5 lakh crore to Rs 24.71 lakh crore, but the withdrawals were not from growth assets. While liquid fund outflows were on account of the year-end and lockdown requirements, investors withdrew from arbitrage funds after spreads between cash and futures turned negative. “Advance tax payments, payment of dividends in March and buybacks by promoters have led to sharp outflows from debt funds,” said Tarun Birani, CEO, TBNG Capital Advisors.

Smallcap and midcap flows fell to Rs 163 crore and Rs 1,233 crore. Multicap funds that invest in a mix of large, mid and small cap stocks saw flows of Rs 2,268 crore, compared to Rs 1,625 crore in the previous month. Balanced funds, banking and PSU debt funds, credit risk funds, and equity savings funds, and gilt funds were some categories that saw outflows in March.

Show more » Stock markets have an uncanny ability to surprise – both on the upside and downside. Also, markets overreact, that too in both directions. The market crash of 32 per cent in March 2020 and the subsequent incredible recovery of around 100 per cent from the March lows reflect ‘Mr Market’s’ famed mood swings. Investors have to react cautiously between these mood swings to minimise the loss from crashes and to optimise the returns from rallies. This needs clarity on two factors: How the markets are positioned in a given context and how it is likely to trend, going forward? Let’s try to get the issue in perspective. It is important to appreciate the fact that the current bull run in equity is global. The primary drivers of the rally are the abundant liquidity available in the global financial system, historically low interest rates and the new trend of hyper investment activity by retail investors – the so-called ‘Robinhood phenomenon’. A runaway market without adequate valuation support needs only a trigger for correction and recently that came from the bond market. It is important to understand that the US 10-year bond yield is the single most important financial indicator that can move all markets - bond, equity and currency. And, when inflation fears emerged, the bond bears pressed the 'sale' button pushing up yields. On February 25, the 10-year yield spiked to 1.61 per cent in the US, leading to a selloff in US equities. In emerging markets, FIIs sold heavily spreading panic and the bears charged in to exploit the opportunity. Nifty crashed 568 points on February 26.

Is this rally similar to the 2003-07 bull market? A much-debated issue now is whether the current bull run is a repeat of the 2003-07 bull run, which took the Sensex from 3,000 in May 2003 to above 20,000 by December 2007. There are some similarities and some stark differences. The 2003-07 bull market, too, was characterized by huge FII inflows, which continued in spite of a steady rise in US bond yield from 3.4 per cent in May 2003 to 4.3 per cent by the end of 2007. But the stark differences cannot be ignored. When the 2003-07 bull run started, valuations were very low with Nifty PE quoting at around 12. So, there was room for PE expansion to take the market higher. More importantly, the 2003-07 period witnessed record GDP growth of around 8.4 per cent annually and corporate earnings grew by an impressive 30 per cent CAGR. This impressive earnings growth provided the fundamental support to the market. This was in sharp contrast to the current situation where the trailing Nifty PE is excessive at around 40 and FY22 Nifty forward PE is very high at around 22.

There is no clarity on this. FY22 growth – GDP growth at 12 per cent and earnings growth at above 30 percent – will be impressive, thanks mainly to the base effect. But beyond that? The capex expansion cycle can sustain the growth rate. The bold Budget 2021 that focussed on privatisation can turn out to be a trigger. The jury is still out on this. The inflation threat The major known threat to this bull market is inflation. Bond bears believe a combination of ultra-loose monetary policy and the $1.9 trillion US fiscal stimulus will trigger inflation and a sustained rise in bond yields, leading to a market crash. The market has a clear logic: bond yields and stock prices are negatively correlated. That’s why Warren Buffet famously said that “interest rates act like gravity on stock prices.” So when interest rates reverse direction, equities have to decline, because higher interest rates can support only lower PEs.

US Fed Chairman Jerome Powel was quick to explain that rising yield is an indication of growth recovery. The bond market is discounting an imminent rebound in growth. The Fed chief went on to emphasize that the Fed rate will be kept near zero through 2023 and that the Fed will tolerate higher inflation, if need be. In brief, if inflation continues to remain subdued and growth makes a smart recovery, markets can remain buoyant, globally. In this favourable global construct, if growth and earnings accelerate in India, this rally will sustain. On the other hand, if inflation suddenly spikes pushing the US 10-year bond yield higher, say beyond 1.8 per cent, there can be a selloff in equity markets. Let’s keep our fingers crossed. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} (Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

H... Show more » We have never had a global recession or market meltdown triggered by a public health crisis in modern history. Recent recessions and market meltdowns were triggered by economic/financial causes. But now, we have a market meltdown triggered by a global pandemic. The meltdown has been savage, globally. This is the worst crash in the shortest time. In 2008, the crash was worse. In India, Nifty crashed 65 % from the peak; but that was spread over several months. This time a 30 per cent crash happened within a few days. In the mother market US, Dow crashed 32 per cent in 18 days. The crucial factors everyone is looking forward to is: When will the new cases peak? In China, it peaked in two months after the outbreak. Once new cases peak in the US and Europe, stability will return. This medical number will dictate the financial/ economic numbers. Global economy is already in recession A prediction, which can be made with reasonable accuracy, is that the global economy will slip into recession in 2020. Almost certainly, we are in recession now. There are a few who fear that this can even lead to a depression. Initial estimates suggest the global economy will contract 1 per cent this year. Q2 contraction would be savage. Last time the global economy contracted was in 2008-09. You Might Also Like: India's March services activity contracts amid coronavirus disruptions Even in 2008, when the market crash was worse, the real economy was working. But now, the real economy has come to a grinding halt due to the total shutdown in most parts of the world. Recovery? Yes. When? Difficult to predict Another possible prediction is that this epidemic will also come to an end and the global economy will recover. But when the epidemic will end and when will the global economy start to recover is difficult to predict, perhaps in two months, perhaps in two quarters. The recovery in the markets is likely to be swift and sharp. Our markets have been dancing to the tune of the mother market, Wall Street. But it is important to appreciate the fact that the situation is much better in India in terms of the virus impact. A very recent research report said warm temperature can slow down the spread of the virus. So it is possible that India may be less impacted. Stay calm You Might Also Like: India at attractive levels, but has not hit bottom yet: CLSA True, these are unnerving times. In panic situations like this, it is important to stay calm. The market is down by around one-third already. Values that we see in the market are reflections of fear, panic and total confusion. So stay calm. Investors can certainly nibble at blue chips available at attractive prices. FMCG, pharma and IT and very selective financials look attractive in the present context.

    "article_content": "PTI The number of people infected with the coronavirus topped 1,07,000 across the world as the outbreak reached more countries and caused more economic carnage. Commodity Summary MCX CRUDEOIL The fall in crude oil price is positive for the country, says Atanu Chakraborty , Economic Affairs Secretary . His views came after oil prices tanked over 30 per cent on Monday after Saudi Arabia slashed prices and set plans for a dramatic increase in crude production in April. He also added that the domestic equity markets are falling due to global cues and coronavirus. The benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty crashed over 4 per cent intraday on Monday followed a slide in global peers as fears intensified over the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. The number of people infected with the coronavirus topped 1,07,000 across the world as the outbreak reached more countries and caused more economic carnage. The 30-share index declined 1,536 points to 36,040, while the 50-share Nifty index was down 425 points at 10,564. Chakraborty also added that there is no liquidity issue in the Indian market and the country has enough foreign exchange reserve. The country’s foreign exchange reserves jumped by $5.42 billion to a lifetime high of $481.54 billion in the week to February 14, on the back of rise in foreign currency assets, according to the latest data from the RBI. “Fundamentals of Indian economy continue to be strong,” he added. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Oil prices in India Economic Affairs Secretary Crude oil Atanu Chakraborty coronavirus oil prices (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

Related US oil rises to highest since 2014 amid global energy crunch Commodity strategies: Gold, silver, crude, base metals WhatsApp outage hits trading in assets from crypto to Russian oil Mumbai: Rising global oil prices are usually perceived to be bad for India. But, when it comes to the stock market , that is not the case. On the contrary, Indian stocks have rallied despite the jumps in crude prices. An ET study shows the correlation between crude oil prices and Nifty 's movement has been positive over the last two decades. In the past two decades, the benchmark Nifty has rallied in six out of the nine times when crude prices ran up. In the month after the rally, the stock benchmark gained on five out of the nine times. The losses on three out of the four times have been less than 2%. Similarly, in the three-month period after the crude oil's price jump, Nifty rose on six out of the nine occasions. Analysts say stocks and crude mostly tend to move in tandem as both these assets respond to risk sentiment similarly.

Though the sentiment has been shaken of late, the market has remained firm. Between 2001 and 2007, both Nifty and crude moved in tandem to a peak and crashed at beginning of 2008. In February 2009, both these assets formed a low and again moved together till early 2011. However, for a shorter period in February-May of 2011, there was an inverse correlation during which the Nifty crashed, but crude continued to move higher. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Oil crude shock stock market Nifty stocks assets (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "iStock Indian equity benchmarks fell for the fourth session in a row on Wednesday and recorded their worst day in over three weeks after strong US data fuelled worries about higher-for-longer interest rates. Ahead of the release of the crucial Fed minutes that may provide cues on the Fed’s rate hike action going ahead, Nifty crashed 272 points and ended around 17,550. Further, fall in the Adani Group stocks dented sentiments dragging Sensex down 927 points to settle at 59,745. Sector-wise, all indices ended in the red, with Nifty Metal and Nifty PSU Bank emerging as top losers. Here's how analysts read the market pulse: “NIFTY 50 index is trading in a downtrend with lower-high and lower-low formation intact on the daily and weekly charts. The momentum indicator RSI is on the verge of a breakdown and is likely to enter the weak zone. The view remains bearish as long as the index stays below the 18,000 mark and can slide towards 17,400/ 17,200 levels,” said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities . “Resurgence of cold war between US & Russia has brought apprehension in the market. Although it should be a short-term effect, the fear of sanctions against Russia and its degree of implication on the economy, especially on food and oil exports, is adding to the anxiety. The market is just recovering from the pandemic, and high interest & inflation are the headwinds in the background. It is presumed that this war will be fought on an economic front, limiting its effect on strong economies like the US & India. Awaiting the release of Fed and RBI minutes are the other major elements that kept investors on the side lines,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services . That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Thursday's action: US market Wall Street 's main indexes edged up on Wednesday, a day after their worst performance of the year, as investors awaited minutes from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting for fresh clues on the trajectory of interest rates. US stocks shed over 2% on Tuesday after a rebound in business activity in February stoked fears of interest rates staying higher for longer. Minutes from the Fed's January 31-February 1 meeting, due at 2:00 p.m. ET, are expected to detail the breadth of debate at the central bank about the rate hike path. At 10:02 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 25.09 points, or 0.08%, at 33,154.68, the S&P 500 was up 1.41 points, or 0.04%, at 3,998.75, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 11.20 points, or 0.10%, at 11,503.50. Six of the major S&P 500 sectors gained, with consumer discretionary stocks adding 0.4%. European shares European shares opened lower on Wednesday, weighed down by a decline in mining stocks as metal prices fell, and as strong economic data sparked worries that interest rates could stay higher for longer. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.4% by 0809 GMT. Investors are also awaiting the release of the minutes of the US Federal Reserve's last meeting, due later in the day. The European basic resources index shed 1.4%, as miners tracked a fall in copper prices, also weighed down by worries about the demand outlook from China. Tech View: Negative candle A reasonable negative candle was formed on the daily chart with minor lower shadow. “We observe formation of overlapping candles during present weakness and the sharp decline from the swing highs (16th Feb) is missing. This pattern indicates a possibility of an upside bounce which is expected to emerge from the lows,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities. Stocks showing bullish bias Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ) showed bullish trade on the counters of Coffee Day Enterprises , ITI, Thermax, Tube Investments and Sharda Cropchem , among others. The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa. Stocks signaling weakness ahead The MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of ITC, Paytm, Tata Chemicals , Pricol and Havells India among others. Bearish crossover on the MACD on these counters indicated that they have just begun their downward journey. Most active stocks in value terms Adani Enterprises (Rs 1527 crore), RIL (Rs 1,219 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 1,172 crore), HDFC Bank (Rs 840 crore) and HDFC (Rs 777 crore) were among the most active stocks on NSE in value terms. Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify those with highest trading turnovers in the day. Most active stocks in volume terms Yes Bank (Shares traded: 10.6 crore), IRB Infra (Shares traded: 10.19 crore), Vodafone Idea (Shares traded: 9.4 crore), Zomato (Shares traded: 7.58 crore) and PNB (Shares traded: 5.01 crore) were among the most traded stocks in the session on NSE. Stocks showing buying interest Shares of IRB Infra, NMDC Steel, Blue Star, Cyient and Triveni Turbine among others witnessed strong buying interest from market participants as they scaled their fresh 52-week highs, signaling bullish sentiment. Stocks seeing selling pressure Shares of Adani Transmission , Adani Gas, Adani Green Energy , BSE, Tata Tele, Godrej Properties and Laurus Labs among others hit their 52-week lows, signaling bearish sentiment on the counters. Sentiment meter favours bears Overall, market breadth favoured bears as 884 stocks ended in the green, while 2,592 names settled with cuts.

    "article_content": "iStock Sensex and Nifty declined for a third day in a row to close at 5-month low levels on Monday due to a massive sell-off in banking, finance and auto stocks as fears of potential contagion from the biggest bank failure in the US since 2008 gripped Indian equity markets. In a choppy trade, Nifty gave up close to 260 points and ended at 17,150 points. Meanwhile, Bank Nifty crashed even more sharply by over 2%. Here's how analysts read the market pulse: “Nifty ended at the lowest since mid October. A breach of 17087 level on the Nifty could result in a fall towards 16747. Up moves could face resistance at 17325,” said Deepak Jasani, Retail Research Head, HDFC Securities, said. “Bloodbath was seen in the global market as the fallout of Silicon Valley Bank was followed by turmoil at Signature Bank, keeping investors worried about the strength of the US banking system. Importantly, the Fed’s decision in the upcoming meeting will have a crucial impact on the market sell-off, as the consensus is reversing to no rate hike trajectory. Also, the US inflation due on Tuesday will have a vital impact in the short-term as the market anticipates a cool down from January levels,”said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services . That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Tuesday's action: US market U.S. stock indexes were mixed in choppy trading on Monday as investors weighed a possible pause in interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in March and risks of a contagion from Silicon Valley Bank's collapse. At 10:39 am ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 28.10 points, or 0.09%, at 31,937.74, the S&P 500 was down 1.70 points, or 0.04%, at 3,859.89, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 26.58 points, or 0.24%, at 11,165.47. Among individual stocks, Pfizer Inc was up 1.9% after the drugmaker said it would buy Seagen Inc for nearly $43 billion. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.37-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.74-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. European shares European stocks fell on Monday and were on course for their worst day in almost three months, as the region's banking stocks continued to tumble even after authorities stepped in to cap the fallout from the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 2.4% and eyed its biggest percentage decline in December 2022. Banks, automakers and insurers were among the top decliners. The ECB looks set to hike rates by 50 bps later this week. The wider risk off moves sent Credit Suisse shares down 12.1% to a fresh record low. Tech View: Tall bearish candle Besides forming lower highs and lower lows on the hourly charts, Nifty today formed a tall bearish candle on the daily charts as it revisited mid-October levels. Stocks showing bullish bias Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ) showed bullish trade on the counters of NCL Industries , Asian Hotels , DRC Systems and Renaissance Global among others. The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals on traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa. Stocks signaling weakness ahead The MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of Zomato, Equitas SFB, IRB Infra, HCL and Oil India among others. Bearish crossover on the MACD on these counters indicated that they have just begun their downward journey. Most active stocks in value terms Sona BLW Precision (Rs 5,072 crore), Mahindra CIE (Rs 895 crore), Adani Enterprises (Rs 146 crore), Adani Power (Rs 140 crore) and Yes Bank (Rs 139 crore) were among the most active stocks on NSE in value terms. Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify the counters with highest trading turnovers in the day. Most active stocks in volume terms Sona BLW Precision (Shares traded: 12.36 crore), Yes Bank (Shares traded: 8.91 crore), Suzlon Energy (Shares traded: 2.85 crore) and Vodafone Idea (Shares traded: 2.79 crore) were among the most traded stocks in the session on NSE. Stocks showing buying interest Shares of Action Construction, NCC, HAL, Kaynes Technology, Mahanagar Gas and Cummins India , among others, witnessed strong buying interest from market participants as they scaled their fresh 52-week highs, signaling bullish sentiment. Stocks seeing selling pressure Shares of Brightcom Group , Piramal Pharma, Piramal Enterprises , Network18 Media, Pfizer, Bayer Cropscience , Muthoot Finance , Relaxo Footwears among others hit their 52-week lows, signaling bearish sentiment on the counters. Sentiment meter favours bears Overall, market breadth favoured bears as 766 stocks ended in the green, while 2,838 names settled with cuts.

    "article_content": "V K Vijayakumar Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services He is known for his articles on capital markets, wealth management, and Indian and global economy. H... Show more » The legendry investor John Templeton said, “ Bull markets are born on pessimism, grown on skepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria.” Nifty has rallied by 15 per cent from the March lows to set new record highs. Where are we in this bull phase? This bull phase was born on the pessimism of the Covid outbreak when Nifty crashed to 7,511 in March 2020. For the next 18 months, we had a one-way rally born on skepticism, which took the Nifty to 18,604 in October 2021. After a consolidation phase lasting more than a year, the bull is charging again. We are not yet in the stage of euphoria. The rally is global Even though the recent rally didn’t come as a surprise, the ferocity of the rally took most investors by surprise. Broadly, there are two factors driving this rally: one, global and two, domestic. It is important to understand that the ongoing stock market rally is global. In the mother markets the US, the S&P 500 is at a 52-week high; Euro Stoxx 50 is at a 52-week high; Germany has tipped into recession, but the DAX is at a 52-week high; French CAC is at a 52-week high; Japanese Nikkei is roaring with 24 percent YTD returns; in South Korea and Taiwan indices are at 52-week highs; in India Nifty and Sensex are at record highs. This is a global rally. The fear was overdone Markets often overreact, both on the upside and downside. When the reality dawns, the excesses will be corrected. Last year, globally, markets corrected with big downturns in the developed world. In the mother Market US, Nasdaq corrected by more than 30 percent. Markets were reacting to the aggressive monetary tightening by the US central bank Fed. The market fear was that the US economy will tip into a recession in 2023, perhaps by mid-2023, impacting global growth. The majority of economists and market experts felt that a US recession was inevitable; many feared a hard landing for the US economy. In 2022, markets discounted this concern. But what is the reality now? A US recession is nowhere in sight: 2023 Q1 GDP growth at 2 percent was 50 per cent higher than estimates. Monetary tightening by the Fed has paid off with US CPI inflation declining from the peak of 9.2 per cent in to 3 per cent in June 2023. The labour market is extremely tight and unemployment continues to remain at a 50-year low of 3.6 per cent. The ongoing rally confirms Fed Chief Jerome Powell’s remark that “the case of avoiding a recession is more likely than having a recession.” Indian economy is in a sweet spot The domestic factors sustaining the rally are India’s strong and improving macros and the flood of FPI inflows triggered by these fundamentals. Indian economy is in a sweet spot with impressive GDP growth, declining CAD, stable currency, and promising leading indicators like rising PMI, sustained steady growth in GST and direct tax collections and resilient credit growth. The primary factor that has triggered this rally is the ‘U-turn in the FPI strategy from ‘Sell India, Buy China’ during January and February this year to ‘Buy India, Sell China’ during the last three months. The initial enthusiasm triggered by China’s post-Covid opening up in early 2023 has not been sustained. Chinese macros and demographics indicate a sharply slowing Chinese economy and declining prospects for investment in China. Furthermore, India is now regarded by foreign investors as a major long-term beneficiary of the China Plus One policy pursued by the developed world, particularly the US. It is this changed perception of India vis-à-vis China that has triggered massive FPI flows into India. FPIs who sold stocks for Rs 34,626 crore in the first 2 months of 2023 turned massive buyers and bought stocks for Rs 43,838 crore and Rs 47,148 crore in May and June, respectively. The buying trend continues in July. At 19,500, Nifty is trading above 20 times FY24 estimated earnings. Considering India’s bright growth prospects, India deserves a higher valuation than the historical PE multiple of 16. But from the near-term perspective, at a PE multiple of 20, the market is running ahead of fundamentals. The market is not yet in a euphoric phase, but it is time to be cautious.

    "article_content": "ETMarkets.com Octanom Tech , an InvesTech startup , has launched its first artificial intelligence-backed platform, Hedged , that will provide investment and trading solutions to retail investors. Octanom Tech is a technology firm, building platforms in the financial market space and aims to be \"India's largest retail movement\" for traders and investors. Retail participation in the Indian capital market has risen multifold in the last couple of years and the trend is expected to continue in the near term. ‘Hedged’ will give traders hedged options trades, powered by a combination of proprietary algorithms. Its in-built Nifty crash meter — the only predictive tool of its kind — will forecast the onset of a crash or an up move before it happens, and help investors position their portfolios accordingly, the tech start-up said in a release. The platform also offers curated micro-sized investment funds with built-in hedges to protect investors’ wealth from market volatility. With a view to provide relevant information on trading and investment, the application also offers ‘Hedged TV’ which will provide tailored information and learning. “More than 50% of Indians’ savings are tied up in bank deposits, which has a huge opportunity cost due to suboptimal returns. India is a ripe market that is primed for a growth spurt and I think it’s about time that our people, our home-grown investors, become active participants and integral beneficiaries of this incredible growth story that is in the making,” said Rahul Ghose, founder and CEO of Octanom Tech, while launching the application. While fund managers and investment bankers have access to technology that can aid their decision-making process, Octanom plans to bring this tech to retail traders and investors. The company plans to disrupt the online retail trading space with three similar revolutionary platforms over the next two years in India and in the US. The Hedged app is available on the Google Play Store, and will be available on the Apple App store later this month.

    "article_content": "iStock Dragged by losses in index heavyweights - IT and banking counters - Indian equity benchmark indices swung back to losing ways on Thursday ahead of the monthly F&O expiry later today. Weak earnings from Tech Mahindra weighed on tech stocks while banking stocks extended their slide as selling continued in HDFC Bank . BSE Sensex plunged 700 points to below sub-70,500 level while Nifty50 slipped below the 21,300 mark. Tech Mahindra was the biggest Nifty loser as its shares fell 6% after the IT company reported a disappointing set of quarterly numbers on Wednesday with profit plunging 61% YoY. Retail favourite smallcaps and microcaps were unaffected. The Nifty Microcap 250 index was up over 1% while the Smallcap 250 index was also trading in the green zone. \"The market seems to be navigating through a corridor of uncertainty, with our bias weighing more on weakness. Further bounce-backs are expected to be met with selling pressure. Immediate resistance is seen around 21550-21600, while Tuesday's high at 21750 remains a pivotal level. On the downside, yesterday's low around 21100 and the 50SMA around 21000 serve as immediate support before the market potentially heads lower in the near term,\" said Samit Chavan of Angel One. Key factors behind the Sensex, Nifty crash today: 1) Banking trouble Investors are unwilling to forgive HDFC Bank's Q3 miss with the stock tumbling another 2% in today's session. The stock has the second largest weightage in Nifty. The banking index also fell over 1% with AU Small Finance and Axis Bank dropping 2-3%. 2) IT stocks sour mood Tech Mahindra shed 6% and was the top Nifty loser after it posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly profit due to weak client spending. Its poor performance also rubbed off on other IT stocks in the indices. After banking, IT stocks have the highest weightage in benchmark indices. 3) Rising bond yields The rising bond yields in the US is a matter of concern for investors. \"This rally in global stock markets was triggered by the Fed pivot which saw the 10-year bond yield falling from 5% to around 3.8%. Now the 10-year is back at 4.18% which indicates that the Fed rate cut will come only in H2 of 2024,\" V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. 4) FIIs remain net seller FIIs extended their selling streak to a sixth session on Wednesday. In the six sessions since, FIIs have sold Indian shares worth Rs 34,766 crore, which has pulled the benchmark Nifty 50 down about 3%. \"Since the tug of war between the FIIs and DIIs continues, volatility will remain high in the near-term. This volatility may be used by investors to churn their portfolios,\" said Dr. V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services. 5) Expiry jitters Ahead of the upcoming long weekend, which comes on the day of monthly derivative expiry, traders are avoiding aggressive overnight positions and maintain lighter positions. \"Nifty may encounter resistance at higher levels, particularly with the 21600 Call strike holding significant open interest. On the downside, support is expected from Put writers at 21300 and 21400 levels,\" said Shrey Jain of SAS Online. 6) Crude oil prices rise Oil prices rose on Thursday after data showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell more than expected last week, while the Chinese central bank's cut in banks' reserve ratio reinforced hopes of more stimulus measures and economic recovery. The March contract for Brent crude gained 25 cents, 0.31%, to $80.29 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude climbed 30 cents, or 0.4%, to $75.39 a barrel.

    "article_content": "IANSHINDI C Shares of India’s largest PSU Bank State Bank of India ( SBI ) fell by 13% on BSE today to Rs 787.95, erasing Rs 1.07 lakh crore from market capitalisation as the total market capitalisation of the company now stands at Rs 7.03 lakh crore after today’s bloodbath on the D-Street. The shares, however, recovered from the day’s low of Rs 734.25, which was 18% lower than yesterday’s closing price. SBI shares had given YTD gains of 41.10% till Monday, which has now dropped to 21.7% after today’s market crash. Other PSU bank stocks too fell sharply by up to 17.6% on Tuesday on the NSE, following the expectations of BJP winning the Lok Sabha elections but at a lower-than-expected margin. Shares of the Union Bank of India saw a 17.6% decline while Bank of Baroda also fell 16%. Canara Bank , Punjab National Bank (PNB), Indian Bank , and Bank of India also fell over 12% each. Meanwhile, Indian Overseas Bank, UCO Bank, and Bank of Maharashtra fell over 11%. Also read: Nifty crash worst single-day fall since Covid days. What should investors do? Earlier last week, Motilal Oswal remained overweight on financials and PSU banks, favouring ICICI Bank and SBI. Meanwhile, Sanjiv Bhasin, Director of IIFL Securities , expressed bullishness on HDFC, ICICI, Axis, and Kotak, highlighting RBL as a potential outperformer. He noted that private largecap banks should perform well for the rest of the year, maintaining an overweight stance on these banks. Last week, CLSA identified SBI, Canara Bank, and Bank of Baroda among its list of 54 \"Modi stocks,\" referring to companies or sectors benefiting directly from government policies under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During Modi 2.0 (from June 2019 to May 2024), 10 out of 12 PSU bank stocks delivered multibagger returns of up to 473%. According to Ace Equity data, Indian Overseas Bank was the top performer among PSU banks, delivering 473% returns during the Modi 2.0 tenure. Bank of Maharashtra and UCO Bank followed with returns of 325% and 226%, respectively. Central Bank of India, State Bank of India (SBI), Indian Bank, Canara Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Union Bank of India, and Bank of Baroda provided returns ranging from 106% to 150% over the last five years.

    "article_content": "PTI MUMBAI: Emkay Global Financial Services today admitted an error on its part for the 900-point flash crash of the NSE index Nifty on Friday morning, and said it would help the stock exchange in probe into the matter. The shares of the company fell by 10 per cent this morning. They had seen a similar plunge on Friday as well. In a clarification to the stock exchanges, Emkay Global said, \"On October 5, while executing an order to transact a Nifty cash basket, in Nifty-50, a dealer committed a bona fide error. \"The error was in entering the value of the order as the quantity of Nifty-50 basket to be transacted. The order got transmitted to the NSE trading server as a single large Nifty basket order comprising of Nifty 50 stocks . \"Immediately on realising the error, we promptly got in touch with the NSE and kept in touch with them to co-ordinate all future course of action until the entire erroneous outstanding position was closed out.\" The company's scrip continued its southward journey for the second consecutive day and tanked 10 per cent to hit the lower trading limit today. Soon after the opening trade, shares of the company plunged 9.97 per cent to to touch the lower circuit limit of Rs 28 on the BSE . At NSE, the stock plummeted 9.98 per cent. The Nifty on Friday morning fell by about 900 points within seconds in a flash crash like situation, which led to a halt in trading at NSE for about 15 minutes. The NSE had said there was no technical glitch in its system and blamed the crash on erroneous orders worth over Rs 650 crore for multiple trades by Emkay Global in various stocks at low prices for an \"institutional client\". Emkay Global further said, \"All our remaining clients' outstanding positions are intact and we will continue to service all obligations. We are hopeful that this obvious and apparent error would justify the annulment of these trades, and believe in the NSE's professional management to see the merits for annulment, which is the practice worldwide.\" The NSE has disabled trading for us to facilitate investigations and primarily to prevent any further exposure until this settlement is completed, the company said. \"We are actively working with the NSE to facilitate this process and to bring it to an expeditious closure. We wish to clarify and confirm that our membership has not been suspended as has been inaccurately reported in some sections of the media. We are adequately capitalised to meet all our financial obligations,\" Emkay said. \"We trust that this unfortunate, although bona fide, error will be put behind us expeditiously and remain committed to serving our stakeholders, shareholders and clients,\" it noted. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Sensex BSE NSE nifty Emkay Global flash crash journey Touch stocks Financial Services (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "ET Bureau MUMBAI: Securities and Exchange Board of India has censured the National Stock Exchange, holding it responsible for not taking enough steps to avert the ‘flash crash’ on October 5, 2012. On this day, a trade led to a 900-point dive inss the Nifty in two minutes, resulting in the index hitting the lower circuit filter. Sebi, in an order late on Friday, said NSE had not adhered to the rules on circuit filters in this incident and did not effectively ensure that its stock brokers have necessary risk controls. Directing NSE to take a comprehensive review of its system, Sebi ’s whole-time member Prashant Saran, in the 40-page order, said, “I observe that the system followed by NSE is not robust. Wrong action on the part of one individual could result in bringing the entire system to a halt... Therefore, it needs an indepth analysis as how the systems could be made more robust so that mistakes on the part of one or two persons do not bring the entire system to a halt.” Sebi rules require bourses to shut trading for two hours if the benchmark indices hit 10% in a single day. NSE had shut the equity segment for only 15 minutes on October 5 and did not shut down the equity derivatives segment. Sebi has directed NSE to carry out a comprehensive review by an independent expert of the processes followed, checks in place, systems employed by NSE. “The consultant shall suggest a more robust securities trading system and submit its report within a period of three months from the date of this order,” it said. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Consultant markets NSE nifty sebi stock broker benchmark risk management (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "PTI MUMBAI: The market euphoria evaporated after the NDA government presented its maiden Railway and Union Budget this week as investors felt there was lack of big-bang initiatives, sending Sensex and Nifty down over 3.5 per cent. The week saw the Sensex crossing 26,000-mark and Nifty registering 7,800 during intra-day trade for the first time in the history, but there was also this post-budget slide not seen since July 2009. Extreme caution resulted intense profit-booking as investors rued of budgets lack of far-reaching reforms and absence of subsidies and above all of concerns over GAAR ( General Anti-Avoidance Rules ). Renewed Eurozone debt concerns on reports of Portugal's biggest listed bank, Banco Espirito Santo, missing debt payments also added the disappointment. Barring FMCG and IT counters, profit-booking was witnessed in Power, Capital-Goods, Realty, PSUs, Consumer Durables, Metals, Auto and Banking sectors. Broader markets including shares of mid-cap and small-cap companies also saw intense selling. The Sensex opened sharply higher at 26,039.67 and surged to an all-time high of 26,190.44 but fell back to a low of 24,978.33 before ending at 25,024.35, showing a fall of 937.71 points or 3.61 per cent. The NSE 50-share Nifty also climbed to an all-time high of 7,808.85 before finishing the week at 7,459.60, showing a dip of 292.00 points or 3.77 per cent. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 2362.42 crore during the week, including provisional data of July 11. Jignesh Chaudhary, Head Of Research, Veracity Broking Services said, \"The Indian equity markets observed some corrections in the trading week, this was amongst the most important trading week as this had the debut budget for the people's government so the hopes were very much high for the common man. The budget was satisfactory for all as people knew that the government did not have much place to offer benefits to people so they could not compromise on the tax earnings.\" \"The markets also saluted the budget and grew but could not manage to close in the green. The Economic Calendar is active and one of the most important thing to watch for Indian and US Economy as there are many data release which are scheduled - Indian WPI is scheduled and which is expected to improve than the previous data release. PPI Data is scheduled for US which is expected to improve along with Core retail sales which is also expected to improve than the previous release this might affect the markets,\" he added. Among the 30-share Sensex pack, 21 stocks declined and and nine gained during the week. Major losers from the Sensex pack were BHEL 15.00 per cent followed by SBI 10.28 per cent, L&T by 9.64 per cent, Coal India 8.02 per cent, ICICI Bank 7.31 per cent, Bajaj Auto 6.99 per cent, Tata Steel 6.62 per cent, RIL 6.29 per cent, ONGC 6.15 per cent, Axis Bank 6.12 per cent, Heromoto Corp 5.73 per cent, NTPC 5.67 per cent, M&M 5.35 per cent, Maruti 5.21 per cent, Tata Power 4.99 per cent, Hindalco 3.81 per cent, SSLT 3.77 per cent Gail India 2.05 percent. However, the gainers were Sun Pharma 4.64 per cent, ITC 3.83 per cent, Infosys 2.68 per cent and HUL 2.65 per cent. Among the S&P BSE sectoral indices, BSE-Power dropped by 10.16 per cent followed by Capital-Goods 9.98 per cent, Realty 9.18 per cent, PSU 8.97 per cent, CD 8.19 per cent, Metal by 7.36 per cent, Bankex by 7.17 per cent and OIl&Gas by 5.87 per cent. Small-cap and Mid-cap indices also fell by 7.80 per cent and 7.02 per cent, respectively. Total market turnover on the BSE and the NSE spurted to Rs 21,240.48 crore and Rs 1,05,761.67 crore respectively from the last weekend's level of Rs 16,906.51 crore and Rs 89,279.00 crore. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Sensex BSE NSE nifty ICICI bank ITC Infosys Shares markets (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

The call lines to all financial planners were jammed this morning. Delhi-based financial planner, Surya Bhatia, says that he has been getting queries from panicked investors. “Most people are regretting the fact that they did not book profits before January 31 (a day before the Budget),” says Bhatia. This brings us to the most important question of the day: What should retail investors do now? Hold your horses Don’t panic. One should invest in equities with a long-term time horizon – one-year and anything shorter is the wrong way to go about it. “Existing investors should hold on to their asset allocations, not panic and sell-off. Even after today’s crash, markets are down to where they were in December. Even if you had put money in the equity a year, you would have made good money,” explains Bhatia. In December, the Sensex was trading in the range of 34, 137 and 32, 565. Right now, the Sensex is at 33, 752. On February 6, 2017, it was at 28, 439 - a gain of almost 19 percent. Anil Rego, CEO & Founder Right Horizons, a financial planning firm, too, echoes Bhatia’s sentiment – don’t be in a hurry to sell, invest in equity with an investment horizon of at least 3-5 years. “One year is too short a time period for equity. Even if this downward phase does last for a few months, don’t change your asset allocation. Be disciplined with your investments and add to your investments as and when you have surplus fund,” says Rego. I am a new investor, will I be okay? Indian retails investors buy when the markets are high and sell when they tank – this is way the cookie crumbles here. So, if you are looking at equity as an investment option, you can look at investing in a staggered manner using systematic investment plans (SIPs). “Large-cap funds are a safe option, so are dynamic asset allocation funds. Invest through the SIP route with at least a 3-5 year horizon,” says Rego. For small investors, the mutual fund route is the best way to invest in stocks. They should not let volatility come in the way of their long-term investment plans. If anything, a crash should be seen as an opportunity to buy more units at lower prices. But don't let this greed for more extend to stocks. Some stocks might have become penny stocks after the crash, but don't be tempted to buy. It doesn't take long for a stock to touch a two-year low or even a five-year low. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on BSE sensex Market crash Sensex stock market financial planning (Catch all the Personal Finance News , Breaking News , Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

Related Fearful FPIs march out of Indian markets, pull out a record $15.9 billion Domestic equity indices eased on Wednesday as rising coronavirus cases along with concerns over growth due to large scale shut down of businesses worried investors on Dalal Street. Multiple research agencies have projected a sharp cut in India’s GDP growth rate, some of them even saying there could be a recession if the lockdown is prolonged. Meanwhile, the number of active cases surged to 1,238, as per the government data. BSE flagship Sensex plunged 741 points to 28,726 while NSE benchmark Nifty shed 254 points to 8,343. Broader market indices were faring better than their headline peers as Nifty Smallcap dipped 0.10 per cent while Nifty Midcap dropped 0.17 per cent. Nifty 500 was down 0.83 per cent. Among bluechip stocks, IndusInd Bank saw low level buying after a 15 per cent fall in the previous session. The scrip jumped 7.42 per cent to Rs 381 as multiple brokerages maintained ‘buy’ rating on it. FMCG giants Nestle India and HUL also gained about a per cent each. Most constituents of the 30-share pack Sensex traded in the red with Kotak Mahindra Bank being the biggest loser. It was down 5.50 per cent at Rs 1,225. ONGC, SBI, Bajaj Finance and HCL Tech were among other major losers. Barring Nifty FMCG and Nifty Realty that were up 0.94 per cent and 0.17 per cent, respectively, all sectoral indices were trading in the red on NSE. Nifty IT was the biggest loser down 1.77 per cent, followed by Nifty Financial Services that dropped 1.73 per cent. Sensex falls 500 points, Nifty below 8,500; IndusInd Bank jumps 10% OPENING BELL: Sensex drops 500 points, Nifty below 8,550; IndusInd Bank surges 10%, ONGC declines 3% Globally, Asian stocks clung to gains helped by a bounce in Australian shares, but risks for equities remain large as the coronavirus pandemic rattles the underpinnings of the global economy. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 traded 1.39 per cent lower in Asian trade, highlighting the cautious mood. MSCI 's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.23 per cent. Australian shares jumped by 2.87 per cent, reversing a 2 per cent decline on Tuesday, as a slowdown in new coronavirus cases and rising iron ore prices lifted the market. Shares in China, where the coronavirus first emerged late last year, rose 0.18 per cent, supported by hopes the world's second-largest economy has started to recover. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} In Video: Sensex falls 500 points, Nifty below 8,500; IndusInd Bank jumps 10% Read More News on Nifty Crash reasons Dalal nifty financial services coronavirus Kotak Mahindra Bank Sensex Crash Today IndusInd Bank MSCI Nifty (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "Getty Images The primary trigger behind the massacre on Dalal Street was a new much potent strain of coronavirus discovered in the UK. NEW DELHI: Stock market bulls, who had got accustomed to Sensex increasing everyday, got an eye-opening jolt on a manic Monday that saw destruction of Rs 6.89 lakh crore of investor wealth--nearly Rs 1,850 crore per minute. The primary trigger behind the massacre on Dalal Street was a new much potent strain of coronavirus discovered in the UK. However, the stage was set for it for quite some time as the market had rallied too much, too fast, said some analysts. \"The new variant of the novel coronavirus in the UK spooked markets as we witnessed intense selling in pivotal throughout afternoon trade. While the street was bracing for a correction this week after a sharp up move, the sheer velocity of the fall across broader markets took the bulls by surprise as practically none of the key indices constituents were in the green today,\" said S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP Securities. The 30-share pack Sensex crashed 1,406.73 points, down 3 per cent. In percentage terms, it was its biggest fall in seven months. Its broader peer NSE Nifty plunged 432.15 points or 3.14 per cent to 13,328.40. Market at a glance: India VIX, barometer of volatility, surges over nearly 25% to 23.19 All Nifty stocks close in the red; all sectoral indices end with cuts Airline stocks crash up to 10% after govt bans flights from London ONGC, Tata Motors top bluechip losers, plunge over 9% Nearly 500 stocks hit lower circuit in BSE, 49 at 52-week lows Among Nifty stocks, there were no gainers but plenty of losers. Tata Motors, which stands to lose in case of no-deal Brexit, plunged nearly 10 per cent. ONGC, GAIL, IndusInd Bank, Hindalco Industries, Indian Oil and BPCL were other major losers. Broader market indices also took a beating, underperforming their headline peers. Nifty Smallcap tanked 5.03 per cent, while Nifty Midcap slumped 4.81 per cent. Nifty 500, the broadest index on NSE, declined 3.44 per cent. Persistent Systems, Heidelberg Cement, Blue Star, Mphasis and Dr Lalpath Labs were only gainers in mid and small cap indices, registering gains in the range of 0-3 per cent. SpiceJet, Graphite India, Equitas Holdings, Indiabulls Housing Finance, BHEL and Tata Power were top losers from broader market space, all of them falling nearly 10 per cent at the end of the day. \"We suggest avoiding naked leveraged trade in the futures segment and preferring option strategies until the markets stabilise. Investors, on the other hand, should utilise this fall and accumulate quality stocks on dips\" — Ajit Mishra, Religare Broking All sectoral indices bled profusely. Nifty PSU Bank plunged 6.93 per cent. Nifty Media, Nifty Realty and Nifty Metal were among those that fell over 5 per cent. Nifty IT fell the least at 1.77 per cent. Market breadth was in favour of losers as 592 stocks ended in the green, while 2,433 names settled with cuts. As many as 224 securities hit 52-week highs, mostly from the smallcap space. Meanwhile, 49 names hit 52-week lows, mostly from the microcap space. About 259 stocks hit upper circuit limits and 499 lower circuit limits. European shares were trading with sharp cuts. Germany’s DAX was down 3.72 per cent, while France’s CAC dipped 3.60 per cent. FTSE was down 2.91 per cent. In Asia, markets closed mixed. Thailand’s Set Composite was the worst performer, down 5.44 per cent. Hang Seng, Nikkei, and Strait Times were other losers.

    "article_content": "Bears liquidated their long positions ahead of the Budget and F&O expiry. NEW DELHI: Rs 2.62 lakh crore wiped out in a little more than six hours. Or in other words, the market lost a Rolls-Royce Phantom -- the most expensive car available for sale in India -- every second. This was the aftermath of mayhem on Wednesday. Bears liquidated their long positions ahead of the Budget and F&O expiry, sending benchmark indices tumbling. Heavyweights RIL and financials were among the worst hit, as worries over Q3 underperformance put them under pressure. Selling by FIIs also dented sentiments. The 30-share pack Sensex tanked 937.66 points or 1.94 per cent to close at 47,409.93. Its broader peer NSE Nifty slid 271.40 points or 1.91 per cent to 13,967.50. Both indices turned negative for the current year. “Indian bourses mirrored mixed sentiment from global peers with a downward rally owing to consecutive days of FII selling. Barring the defensive FMCG segment, all sectors traded in the red zone with banking and pharma stocks being the worst hit. The global markets were mixed today ahead of the US Fed meeting amid uncertainty over the US stimulus. We should expect higher volatility in the coming days' given pre-budget event risk,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. Market at a glance : RIL continues its post Q3, plunges 3% to slide below Rs 1,900 level Investors dump ICICI Sec even thought PAT doubles, stock down 7% India VIX rises 5% ahead of F&O expiry, index ends at 24.39 Nifty FMCG lone sectoral gainer; banking indices most hit Nifty Smallcap index defies market trend, ends with gains \"Investors should build for a defensive portfolio and also hold cash, as there will be good buying opportunities in the future.\" — Naveen Kulkarni, Axis Securities Among the blue-chips, Tech Mahindra was the top gainer, rising 2.62 per cent.

Nifty 500 -- the broadest index on NSE -- dropped 1.68 per cent. Gujarat Gas, L&T Tech Services, National Aluminium, Tata Elxsi, Graphite India and Indian Energy Exchange were top gainers from mid and smallcap indices, climbing in the range of 3-7 per cent. Vakrangee, DCB Bank, Ujjivan Financial Services, ICICI Securities, LIC Housing Finance and Future Retail were major losers from broader market space, falling in the range of 4-7 per cent.

NEW DELHI: After more than six hours of bloodbath on Dalal Street, the aftermath was scary: Rs 5.43 lakh crore of investor wealth wiped out. All Nifty stocks slid in the red. Benchmark indices suffered their biggest single-day fall since May 4, 2020. In essence, investors lost Rs 1,450 crore of wealth every minute on Friday, denting the morale. A surge in benchmark bond yields spooked investors as they feared foreign investors will withdraw money from India now and central banks will also have to change their dovish stance to tame the expected rise in inflation. The 30-share pack Sensex tanked 1,939.32 points or 3.80 per cent to close at 49,099.99. The index hit a low of 48,890.48 during the day. Its broader peer NSE Nifty plunged 568.20 points or 3.76 per cent to 14,529.15. “The bond market is expecting the likely rise in inflation to push the US Federal Reserve to either lower monthly bond-buying or hike interest rates, an adverse factor for markets like India, which have been a major recipient of foreign inflows of late. This is despite the US Fed's reassurance of keeping the low cost of money intact,” said Devang Mehta, Head Equity Advisory, Centrum Broking.

M&M, Power Grid, JSW Steel, Hero MotoCorp, GAIL, Bajaj Finserv, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Grasim Industries were others that ended in the red. There were no gainers. Broader market indices also ended with cuts but performed better than their headline peers. Nifty Smallcap fell 1.21 per cent and Nifty Midcap slipped 1.60 per cent. The broadest index on NSE -- the Nifty 500 -- dropped 3.07 per cent. National Aluminium, SAIL, Indian Hotels, GNFC, Linde India and Engineers India were top gainers from mid and smallcap indices, climbing in the range of 2-7 per cent.

Nifty Private Bank, Nifty Bank and Nifty PSU Bank were other losers, falling about 4 per cent each. \"Indications are in the favour of further decline.

Some countries in Europe have already behind lockdowns while others are also considering the same. Hawkish tone by central banks across the world is not helping the markets either, investors are quick to read the message that days of easy money may be limited. The 30-share pack Sensex declined 1189.73 points or 2.09 per cent to close at 55,822.01. The index at one point had hit the low of 55,132.68 before late stage recovery. Its broader peer NSE Nifty fell 371 points or 2.18 per cent to 16,614.20. Investors were left poorer by Rs 6.81 lakh crore as their wealth reflected by the total market cap of BSE-listed firms stood at Rs 252.55 lakh crore. “Currently sell-off is due to rapid rise in FIIs selling triggered by hawkish world central banks’ policy, cautious view on Indian market due to high valuation compared to peers and drop in retail inflows,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

    "article_content": "Getty Images NEW DELHI: The kickstart of the US Fed taper amid high inflation was on expected lines and so were the foreign outflows from emerging markets like India. But emergence of Omicron and sharper than expected weakness in emerging market currencies are taking a toll on the domestic market where key indices have lost over 10 per cent in value from record high, technically entering a correction phase. At a low of 55,840.14, the BSE Sensex was ruling 10.29 per cent lower than its record high of 62,245.43 hit on October 19. Nifty50 was 10.5 per cent off it's all-time high of 16,635.90. The fresh rout in the market on Monday erased some Rs 5.5 lakh crore investor wealth in the first 15 minutes, adding to a total wealth erosion of Rs 21 lakh crore since October 18. Foreign outflows may continue and weakness may persist in the short term, said analysts, who otherwise believe it is a good time to build a portfolio. Watch out for 200-EMA for Nifty50, technical chart readers said. You Might Also Like: Has the Indian stock market finally found a cure for its FII complex? G. Chokkalingam, Founder, Equinomics Research & Advisory, said the market should stabilise and start recovering from January 2022 and may go on to deliver 10-15 per cent return in 2022. He said the Omicron variant so far doesn’t seem to be causing severe illness and that Indian states might not opt for severe lockdowns given their budgets are under severe fiscal pressures. On Fed rates, he said the US market eventually performed well from 2015 to 2018 when the US Fed rate reversed from zero to over 2 per cent. \"Thus, in our view, short-term risk to the global equity is very high, only if existing vaccinations completely fail against illness and the rate of hospitalisations and also deaths are very high, then the global equity markets world over may fall even 10 per cent. We will remain alerted on these developments over the next two weeks,\" he said. You Might Also Like: Monday Mayhem! Sensex ends at lowest level in 4 months; investors lose Rs 6.81 lakh cr Indians are still buying and your MF portfolios are still up in terms of inflows but the sentiment is down because globally there is no buyer in the secondary market, said Ajay Srivastava of Dimensions Corporate Finance Services. \"When the market goes up by demand-supply mismatch, not fundamentals, you face a correction and whether we like it or not the fact is that high taxation policies on oil will ultimately bite consumption. It comes with a lag. It is filtering through the system. The only redeeming feature to my mind is that as elections come closer and inflation bites people and the votes, we might see a reversal of those policies which is good for the market,\" Srivastava said. Sandip Sabharwal of asksandipsabharwal.com said FII selling will continue in the near term because flows into equity funds globally for this year had been tremendous and that liquidity is ebbing now and central bankers are suggesting that they are no longer impacted by this new variant spread -- they want to act on inflation. Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in said Nifty50 should test its 200-day EMA in December itself, which comes in at 16,250. Mohammad noted that Nifty Bank has already fallen below its 200-EMA and that the index would be falling for the second month now.

Kotak Mahindra Bank is down 14 per cent while SBI has fallen 11 per cent in the last one month. Mehul Kothari, technical researcher at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers, said he would not be surprised if Nifty50 sees a dip of around 500 points intraday on Monday as the breakdown of 16,780 low was very strong. \"This brought in a lot of panic in the market. On positional purpose, we expect things to settle down somewhere near to 16,300 mark, which is the placement of 200-day moving average,\" he said. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on nifty target price nifty nifty target nifty news nifty share price nifty correction nifty crash nifty outlook nifty analysis (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

The BSE Midcap index plunged 3.6 per cent on Monday, taking its recent fall to 8 per cent against a 5.7 per cent fall in Sensex during the same period. Smallcap stocks , which were insulated from the market selloff for most of the last week, have plunged 7 per cent over Thursday's high of 30,772. Here is the market selloff in numbers: 3,000 stocks in red At 1.15 pm, 3,027 actively-traded stocks listed on BSE were trading in the red. This is out of 3,617 stocks that traded during the day.

Besides, persistent foreign capital outflows continued to affect the market sentiment, traders said.

Sensex had plunged over 1,000 points, while the Nifty50 tested 16,850 level in early trade. That said, traders keenly eyed the two-day Fed policy review starting later in the day.

    "article_content": "Shutterstock.com The 21% spike in the Volatility Index or VIX, which measures markets' perception of risk in the near term, to 20.84 on Monday points to the likelihood of further decline. Mumbai: Several technical indicators are flashing red after the benchmark indices fell 2.6% on Monday amid rising concern over faster-than-expected rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve . If the Nifty breaks below the crucial support of 17,000 - the level from which the market bounced on Monday - the index could fall to as much as 16,700-16,800 in the near term, said analysts. The index closed at 17,149.10. The sell-off on Monday resulted in the Nifty ending below various short-term averages, which signals near-term bearishness. Nifty is currently trading below the 50-day moving average of 17,505. It is also below the 100-day moving average of 17,640 and the 20-day moving average of 17,776. \"17,000 has the highest put concentration for the January series so there is a probability the market will try to hold that level but if it breaks that level, a fall to 16,700 cannot be ruled out,\" said Rajesh Palviya, head-technicals and derivatives at Axis Securities. \"17,350 would be an important level to watch out for in the coming days. My view is that the Nifty is likely to break 17,000 on the downside.\" The 21% spike in the Volatility Index or VIX , which measures markets' perception of risk in the near term, to 20.84 on Monday points to the likelihood of further decline. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Why Nifty Crash Nifty us federal reserve market trading VIX (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "Sensex extends losing run to 3rd day, nosedives 1,024 pts; Nifty barely holds 17,200 NEW DELHI: As the Budget dust settles, Dalal Street is facing a real challenge. All these years, the market shrugged off high valuation concerns, citing ample liquidity globally. But with inflation going out of control, central banks globally are in action and Dalal Street is facing the heat. The Bank of England took the lead, raising interest rates by 25 basis points to 0.5 per cent last week. Traders now largely see a 50 basis points Fed rate hike in March. While the RBI is unlikely to bite the bullet in its Thursday's policy outcome, India's retail inflation hit a five-month high of 5.59 per cent in December and is unlikely to come down anytime soon with oil prices hitting a high of $95 a barrel recently. The RBI may soon be acting, today or tomorrow. Last three days of fall have shaved Rs 6.7 lakh crore worth of wealth off investor pockets on Dalal Street. The market value of all BSE listed stocks fell to Rs 263.76 lakh crore today against Rs 270 crore on February 2. India’s consumer price inflation is forecast to rise more than 6 per cent this quarter as core prices pick up. \"This will test the RBI’s commitment to continue with an accommodative monetary stance, particularly as many other leading central banks consider bringing forward the timing of interest rate tightening,\" Moody's said last week. It said the RBI will keep its benchmark repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent, but said even as the Omicron threat to India’s recovery is starting to wane, supply-side stress and volatile energy prices are stoking inflation concerns.

India is perceived to have high valuations, with Nifty50 trading at one-year forward earnings of 20.5 times. The role of quarterly earnings here is important as India is seen clocking perhaps the best earnings growth in Asia this year, with only Indonesia and the Philippines higher in terms of consensus forecasts, Jefferies noted. The consensus earnings growth forecast for the MSCI India this year is 20.3 per cent, compared with 11.3 per cent for Asia ex-Japan region. Rising bond yields are also making equities look unattractive. You Might Also Like: D-Street sees up to 41% upside in SBI after Q3 results. Here's what analysts said Edelweiss said with yields spiking, RBI’s challenge mounts. On one hand, it might be uncomfortable with a spike in yields, but on the other, it is trying to normalise excess liquidity. \"Navigating this dilemma becomes even more challenging with the Fed/ECB on a tightening path. Thus, RBI’s commentary around these issues will be keenly watched,\" it said.

    "article_content": "iStock Wall Street ended sharply lower on Thursday after US consumer prices data came in hotter than expected and subsequent comments from a Federal Reserve official raised fears the US central bank will hike rates aggressively to fight inflation. Domestic equity markets are set for a gap-down start on Friday, tracking the sharp sell-off in US stocks and weaker cues from the Asian peers. Inflation numbers in the US have heated up investors' concerns globally. Oil prices dropped, whereas the dollar gained some strength. Back home, with RBI policy out of the way, Q3 earnings and polls are likely to influence sentiments. Here's breaking down the pre-market actions: STATE OF THE MARKETS SGX Nifty signals a negative start Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange traded 166 points, or 0.94 per cent, lower at 17,440, signalling that Dalal Street was headed for a gap-down start on Friday. Tech View: Nifty50 on Thursday advanced for the third straight day and, in the process, closed above its 50-day exponential moving average (EMA). The 50-pack index topped the 17,600 level and formed a bullish candle on the daily chart, with a long wick. India VIX: The fear gauge dropped about 5 per cent to 17.71 level on Thursday over its close at 18.56 on Wednesday. Asian shares trade mostly lower Asian stocks opened with a loss Friday morning following a sell-off on Wall Street fuelled by a forecast-beating US inflation reading that fanned fears the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates sharply. MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.61 per cent. South Korea's Kospi dropped 0.58% Australia's ASX 200 tanked 0.73% China's Shanghai added 0.15% Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.44% New Zealand's DJ slumped 2.22% US stocks settled lower Wall Street ended sharply lower on Thursday after US consumer prices data came in hotter than expected and subsequent comments from a Federal Reserve official raised fears the US central bank will hike rates aggressively to fight inflation.

Dollar Index was pinned at 95.846 Euro held lower at $1.1400 Pound was steady at $1.3541 Yen dropped to 116.34 per dollar Yuan exchanged hands at 6.3589 against the greenback Oil prices slip on inflation concerns Oil prices eased early on Friday as hot US inflation fanned worries about aggressive interest rate hikes and as investors await the outcome of US-Iran talks that could lead to increased global crude supply. Brent crude futures fell 40 cents, or 0.4 per cent, to $91.01 a barrel at 0140 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude declined 25 cents, or 0.3 per cent, to $89.63 a barrel.

    "article_content": "iStock NEW DELHI: Stock market bulls were seen nursing their wounds on Monday as bears executed a bloodbath on Dalal Street, taking benchmark indices to their biggest loss in the last 10 months. The selling trigger was the worsening Ukraine crisis as Western nations warned Russian invasion could happen as soon as this week. All sectors of the market ended deep in the red. The 30-share pack Sensex dropped 1747.08 points or 3 per cent to close at 56,405.82. Its broader peer NSE Nifty fell 531.95 points or 3.06 per cent to 16,842.80. Both indices extended the losing run to the second day. Thanks to the selling, equity investors lost Rs 8.54 lakh crore as their wealth reflected in the market cap of BSE-listed firms declined to Rs 255.35 lakh crore. They have lost 12.45 lakh crore in the last two days. \"Increased tension between the US and Russia over Ukraine sent oil prices rising and forced investors to dump risky assets. Risk sentiment was further dampened ahead of the Fed’s emergency meeting, which heightened fears of aggressive monetary tightening,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

JSW Steel was the top loser in the Nifty pack, falling 6.47 per cent. HDFC Life Insurance, ITC, Tata Steel, HDFC, Tata Motors, Shree Cement, SBI and UPL were other stocks that ended in the red. Broader market indices ended lower, underperforming their headline peers. Nifty Smallcap fell 4.44 per cent and Nifty Midcap dropped 3.94 per cent. Nifty 500, the broadest index on NSE, ended down 3.30 per cent.

All sectoral indices ended lower on NSE. Nifty PSU Bank was the top loser, down 5.95 per cent, followed by Nifty Realty and Nifty Metal which slipped over 5 per cent as well. Nifty Media and Nifty Financial Services were other major losers. \"Investors are advised to keep strict stop loss considering the volatility in the markets. Also, buy on dips is suggested, but investors should plan their position keeping adequate liquidity.\" — Rahul Sharma, Equity 99 Market breadth was in favour of losers as 567 stocks ended in the green, while 2,984 names settled with cuts. As many as 184 securities hit 52-week highs, mostly from the smallcap space. Meanwhile, 120 names hit 52-week lows, mostly from the microcap space.

    "article_content": "ETMarkets.com Nifty experienced a vertiginous fall, revisiting the prior month's low (i.e. 16,837). Historically it is observed that sudden changes in the sentiment, whipsaw moves are quite normal in the month of February (i.e. post budget). The appearance of a downward gap in today’s trade ensures a shift of range on the lower side. Hence, minor recovery might be there. However, levels of 17,300 could turn out as near term resistance. Nifty broke below the recent low, however, sustenance below 17,000 is essential to unlocking further downside till 16,630 zone. All the sectoral indices faced downticks. India VIX jumped 24% to settle near levels of 23. Higher VIX levels infer more volatile action, making the trading environment difficult for directional traders. Meanwhile, erasing the prior week’s recovery, Bank Nifty fell to 36,844. Since the previous month, Bank Nifty has formed multiple peaks between 38,850-39,400 zone. The same levels are now likely to act as a hurdle zone from a near-term perspective. The right thing to do is to wait for some signals to start appearing before trying to harvest near the lows.

    "article_content": "iStock NEW DELHI: Stock market bulls were blasted off by Vladimir Putin’s advance into Ukrainian territory that also tore down all defences on Dalal Street. Benchmark indices recorded their fourth-worst point-wise fall in history on Thursday. Investors were looking for cover as intense selling left them poorer by Rs 13.57 lakh crore as BSE-market cap, which reflects their wealth, came down to Rs 242.11 lakh crore. The 30-share pack Sensex tumbled 2702.15 points or 4.72 per cent to close at 54,529.91. Its broader peer NSE Nifty tanked 815.30 points or 4.78 per cent to 16,247.95. Both indices logged their seventh straight day of losses. With the crisis deepening in Europe, inflation is set to surge further. Crude oil prices led the way with jumps above $104 per barrel. European gas prices surged more than 30 per cent. Meanwhile, shares in Russia tanked as much as 50 per cent. “We believe crude trajectory will be the key to watch out for going ahead. We don’t expect major sanctions, which may drive a big spike in crude, equally harming Europe and the US, or even in terms of aggressive rate hikes leading to slower economic growth. We, thus, believe that market stabilisation is likely in the short term,” said Vijay Chandok - MD & CEO, ICICI Securities. Market at a glance: India VIX, barometer of future volatility, spiked 30% to 32 No gainers in Nifty, constituent shares fell up to 11% For every stock ending in green on BSE, 14 closed in red Rupee fell 1.5% against dollar, putting more pressure on stocks Among the bluechip names, there were no gainers. Tata Motors was the top loser in the Nifty pack, falling 10.71 per cent. IndusInd Bank, UPL, Grasim Industries, JSW Steel, Adani Ports, Bharat Petroleum and Tata Consumer were other names that ended in the red. Broader market indices ended lower, underperforming their headline peers. Nifty Smallcap fell 6.25 per cent and Nifty Midcap declined 5.74 per cent. Nifty 500, the broadest index on NSE, ended down 5.04 per cent. There were no gainers in the Nifty Smallcap 100 and Nifty Midcap 100 indices. Bombay Dyeing, IFCI, Rain Industries, Prakash Industries and HEG were some of the biggest losers from the small and midcap stocks. All sectoral indices on NSE ended in the red. Nifty PSU Bank tumbled 8.26 per cent, followed by a 7.17 per cent drop in Nifty Realty. Nifty Media and Nifty Auto slumped 6-7 per cent as well. \"While a fall today is a reaction to this development, markets anyway have been factoring in such a development. In that sense, a short term bottom may happen over today or tomorrow.\" — Deepak Jasani, HDFC Securities Market breadth was in favour of losers as 231 stocks ended in the green, while 3,161 names settled with cuts. As many as 72 securities hit 52-week highs, mostly from the smallcap space. Meanwhile, 86 names hit 52-week lows, mostly from the microcap space. European markets were trading higher. London-based FTSE added 2.88 per cent while Paris and Frankfurt added 4.27 per cent and 4.36 per cent, respectively. In Asia, all markets ended in the red. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Sensex Crash Today sensex nifty crash sensex sensex crash sensex today stock market crash (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

Here's what analyst say NEW DELHI: Russian strikes at Europe's largest nuclear plant in Ukraine wiped Rs 5 lakh crore ($66 billion) off investor wealth on Friday, with the geopolitical tension eroding about Rs 15 lakh crore ($197 billion) in fortune ever since Russia on February 15 announced a partial withdrawal of its troops from Ukrainian border only to launch a full-scale invasion later on. Data showed the BSE market capitalisation stood at about Rs 246 lakh crore on Friday compared with Rs 251 lakh crore in the previous session, a fall of Rs 5 lakh crore or $66 billion at today's exchange rate of 76 per dollar. Only a few of analysts on the Street could anticipate the turn of events that followed after Feb 15. Since then, the Sensex has lost about 4,000 points and investors have lost $197 billion. The wealth erosion on Dalal Street was higher than Ukraine's 2021 GDP estimated at $181.03 billion by the IMF. Oil prices, on the other hand, went near the $120 a barrel mark. Sensex drops for 3rd day as Ukraine crisis escalates, sinks 769 pts; Nifty slumps below 16,250 Equity benchmark Sensex tumbled 769 points on Friday, tracking a weak trend in global equities amid escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Extending its decline for the third straight session, the 30-share BSE index slumped 1,214.96 points to 53,887.72 during the session after a weak start. It finally finished at 54,333.81, lower by 768.87 points or 1.40 per cent. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty slumped 252.70 points or 1.53 per cent to close at 16,245.35. MORE STORIES FOR YOU ✕ Sensex plunges over 1,000 points as Russia-Ukraine crisis intensifies D-Street investors lose over Rs 4 lakh cr in morning trade More steam left in this multibagger PSU? Here's what analyst say « Back to recommendation stories I don't want to see these stories because They are not relevant to me They disrupt the reading flow Others SUBMIT On Feb 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised two eastern Ukrainian regions Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states and ordered Russian troops to act as “peacekeepers”. On February 23, Ukraine declared a nationwide state of emergency and, by the next day, Russia launched a full-scale war on Ukraine. Sanctions against Russia kept piling up and oil prices jumped. On Friday, reports emerged that Europe's largest nuclear reactor in Ukraine caught fire in Russian attacks, though it later emerged that the fire was outside of the reactor perimeter and that local firefighters had been allowed in to control the blaze without being shot at. \"It does now, though, highlight another serious risk factor surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the safety of its nuclear plants now that Russia’s tactics appear to be shifting to its usual playbook, levelling cities into submission with artillery and rockets. Europe appears to be at the mercy of the ability of Russian artillery regiments to fire accurately. I’m not comforted by that,\" said Jeffrey Halley, Senior Market Analyst, Asia Pacific, OANDA. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} In Video: Sensex drops for 3rd day as Ukraine crisis escalates, sinks 769 pts; Nifty slumps below 16,250 Read More News on Ukraine GDP sensex crash stock market share market stock market latest news stock market updates share market updates nifty crash (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "Sensex sinks for 4th day amid jittery global markets, ends 1,491 pts lower; Nifty below 15,900 NEW DELHI: There was no respite for bulls on Dalal Street as domestic benchmark indices joined their global counterparts and sank for the fourth straight session on Monday as crude prices surged further. The ongoing war in Europe and tough sanctions on Russia has put heavy pressure on supply-demand dynamics of most commodities, and in response, they are quoting at record high levels. This has spooked investors across the world. The 30-share pack Sensex declined 1,491.06 points or 2.74 per cent to close at 52,842.75. Its broader peer NSE Nifty slumped 382.20 points or 2.35 per cent to 15,863.15. Equity investors’ wealth, reflected in the total market cap of BSE-listed firms, fell by Rs 5.43 lakh crore as the market cap stood at Rs 241.35 lakh crore. “The uncertainty continues due to the current crisis between Russia and Ukraine along with increasing crude oil rates. Investors are advised to retain liquidity and avoid taking new positions in the market till things are clear,” said Rahul Sharma, Equity 99.

    "article_content": "Sensex plunges 1,100 points, Nifty below 17,200; Infosys tanks 6% NEW DELHI: Disappointment over quarterly earnings and unfavourable global cues weighed heavily on investor sentiment as listed stocks eroded over Rs 2.36 lakh crore in value in Monday's selloff. The market capitalisation of all stocks listed on BSE had fallen to Rs 269.59 lakh crore from Rs 272.03 lakh crore last Wednesday, as the market resumed trading today after a long holiday. The benchmark index BSE Sensex tanked 1,172 points or 2.01 per cent at 57,167 while its NSE counterpart Nifty settled at 17,174, down 302 points or 1.73 per cent. Here's what dragged the key indices lower: Infy, HDFC Bank disappoint The quarterly results of HDFC Bank and Infosys last week fell short of market expectations, hurting investor confidence further. The two stocks alone contributed over 500 points in Sensex fall. These stocks accounted for 17.56 per cent of Nifty50 weight as of March 31. Infosys was down 5.7 per cent to Rs 1,649. It also dragged shares of other IT companies such as Tech Mahindra (down 4 per cent), HCL Tech (down 2.3 per cent) and Wipro (down 2.2 per cent), which will soon disclose their quarterly earnings. IT stocks account for substantial weight in Sensex. You Might Also Like: Sensex plunges over 1,400 points as heavyweights Infosys, HDFC Bank under selling pressure On Infosys, CLSA said: \"While demand tailwinds should bring the revenue growth back on track soon, margin recovery may take time given persistent supply-side pressures. The consequent reset in estimates – we cut our FY23EPS forecasts by 5 per cent and FY24 by 4 per cent - could dampen investor sentiment in the near term. However, the stock’s 8 per cent YTD underperformance limits the downside, in our view.\" Another disappointment came from HDFC Bank that fell 3 per cent to Rs 1,420. A host of brokerages have trimmed their price targets on the stock as they felt March quarter earnings growth at 23 per cent YoY was mainly driven by lower provisions. \"We believe two consecutive let-downs on core pre-provision operating profit coupled with merger uncertainty could weigh on the stock. On balance, at September 2023 P/BV of 3 times, retain ‘BUY’ with a target price of Rs 1,860,\" Edelweiss said. China GDP growth soft, Covid cases rise China GDP numbers did not go down well with Asian markets, which fell up to 2 per cent in Monday's trade. China's GDP growth came in at 4.8 per cent year-on-year and that the risk of a sharp slowdown over coming months has risen due to curbs across Shanghai and the Ukraine war. The March quarter growth was well below the official target of 5.5 per cent for 2022. Besides, as per reports, China's economic hub Shanghai reported 2,417 confirmed locally transmitted Covid cases and 19,831 local asymptomatic carriers, the municipal health commission said on Monday. On Sunday, three deaths were reported due to Covid.

Technical charts weak Nifty50 had last week formed an Evening Doji Star-like candle, which signalled more pain ahead. The level of 17,450 was expected to act as an immediate support level but the index breached that level easily. \"A decisive fall below 17,450 levels can lead to a retest of 16,900 level. Thus, traders should maintain a mild bearish outlook going into the next week. A move above the immediate resistance level of 17,850 can negate the bearish outlook,\" Yesha Shah of Samco Securities had said in a weekly note.

The S&P 500 fell 1.2 per cent, ending a shortened trading week with a 2.1 per cent decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent and the Nasdaq composite lost 2.1 per cent. Investors again turned their attention to the drama surrounding Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk and Twitter. Musk offered to buy the social media company for $54.20 a share, two weeks after revealing he would accumulate a 9 per cent stake, agencies reported. Intensifying Russia-Ukraine war There was no signs that Russia-Ukraine war may ease anytime soon. Braced for an all-out Russian assault in the east, Ukraine vowed to \"fight absolutely to the end” in strategically vital Mariupol, PTI reported. With missiles and rockets also battering other parts of the country, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian soldiers of carrying out torture and kidnappings in areas they control. The fall of Mariupol, which has been reduced to rubble in a seven-week siege, would give Moscow its biggest victory of the war, PTI reported. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} In Video: Sensex plunges 1,100 points, Nifty below 17,200; Infosys tanks 6% Read More News on share market crash share market sensex crash nifty crash stock market latest news share market latest news sensex nifty it stocks (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "Agencies The market breadth was skewed in favour of the bears. About 1,472 stocks gained, 1,862 declined and 143 unchanged. In yet another disappointing end to the week, Indian equities gyrated over 1,000 points after facing intense selling pressure in the final hour of the session, dragging benchmarks sharply lower. After opening with healthy gains, both Sensex and Nifty ended with cuts, as US futures logged heavy losses during the day. Erasing initial gains amid a choppy session, the 30-share pack Sensex declined 460.19 points or 0.80% to close at 57,060.87. Axis Bank , Reliance , and Infosys were top index drags. The Nifty Bank index fell nearly 1 per cent. Its broader peer, NSE Nifty50, slumped 142.50 points or 0.83% to 17,102.55. Gains in oil and gas, capital goods, financial and metal stocks failed to hold up headline indices. Further, weakness in select IT names including Wipro , set to report Q4 earnings, after market hours limited the upside. Nifty IT has declined over 10% to post worst month since March 2020. The market breadth was skewed in favour of the bears. About 1,472 stocks gained, 1,862 declined and 143 unchanged. Here are the top reasons markets fell in the final hour: US Futures fall as Big Tech retreats after earnings US stock futures fell early Friday morning following post-earnings slumps in Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. Nasdaq Futures fell 1 per cent, while Dow Jones Industrial Average Futures were down 119 points, or 0.35 per cent. S&P 500 futures retreated by 0.71 per cent. Stocks fizzled after a disappointing forecast from Amazon.com. The shares e-commerce giant dropped 10% in extended trading on Thursday after the company issued a revenue forecast that trailed analysts’ estimates. Disappointing Q4 numbers Axis Bank's fourth quarter results were a mixed bag, with profit growth beating analysts estimates but net interest income (NII) growth, a key focus this earnings season, lagging projections. Axis Bank share price shed more than 6.5 per cent and were the biggest drags on the benchmarks to the tune of 125 points. Shares of Maruti Suzuki ended 2.6 per cent lower even as India's largest carmaker beat profit and revenue estimates for Q4. Maruti Suzuki said its profit after tax (PAT) grew 57.7 per cent YoY to Rs 1,838.90 crore in the March quarter from Rs 1,166.10 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. However, the sales figure was lower than the ET NOW poll estimate of Rs 26,775 crore. Sales volume for the quarter fell 0.7 per cent YoY to 488,830 units against 492,235 units in the same quarter last year. Selling pressure in index-heavyweights Profit-booking in Reliance Industries in the last few minutes of trade contributed to 87-point fall in the 30-share pack. Power Grid, State Bank of India, Titan and NTPC were among the major laggards from the Sensex pack. The benchmark indexes have lost more than 2% in April, hurt by weak earnings from domestic technology firms, fears over the fallout of the Ukraine war, surging inflation and strong policy tightening signals from the Fed. Reduced exposure ahead of LIC IPO After a long wait, the initial public offer (IPO) of insurance behemoth Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India is finally going to hit primary market next week. Domestic investors reduced exposure in equities ahead of holiday-shortened week and opening of India’s largest IPO in India, said Vinod Nair of Geojit Financial Services. The government will raise about Rs 20,557 crore through the IPO, which is short of earlier projections of about Rs 60,000 crore. Nifty forms bearish engulfing pattern \"Nifty formed a bearish engulfing pattern on the daily chart suggesting weakness in the near term. Besides, the benchmark index failed to float above 200-DMA,\" said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities. For the last couple of weeks, the index is oscillating near its key weekly moving averages and this has developed as a triangular pattern on the daily chart, said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan. Overall structure suggests that the index can continue to consolidate in the range of 17,000-17,400 and once the swing low of 16,958 is breached then the index can tumble down towards 16,600, Ratnaparkhi added. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Nifty crash today nifty sensex axis bank wipro reliance infosys nifty bank (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "iStock NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices saw a gap-down start to Monday's session, tracking a sharp selloff in US stocks on Friday as investors fear a likely 50-basis points Fed rate hike this week and stage set for a 75 basis points rate hike in the Fed's June meet. Disappointing management commentaries, impending LIC IPO, weak cues from Asia and bearish technical charts also weighed on domestic indices. At 9.18 am, the BSE Sensex was trading 472.95 points or 0.83 per cent lower at 56,587.92. The index was down over 600 points in the opening trade. Nifty50 slipped below 16,950 in early trade and was later trading at 16,963.60, down 138.95 points or 0.81 per cent. Midcap and smallcap indices fell up to 0.6 per cent. Asian Paints was the worst Sensex stock, falling 1.78 per cent to Rs 3,181. Maruti Suzuki declined 1.78 per cent to Rs 7,595 as March quarter numbers failed to lift investor sentiment. Titan Company, Bajaj Finance, Infosys, Sun Pharma and UltraTech Cement dropped over 1 per cent each. Here's what is spooking Dalal Street investors: Fed rate hike Nomura India expects the Fed to raise rates by 50 basis points at the May FOMC meeting, the first such increase since May 2000, reflecting increased urgency to reach a neutral setting. The post-meeting statement and Chair Powell’s press conference remarks will likely keep the door open to 75 bps hikes, Nomura said. \"That said, we believe it is too early for an explicit endorsement. A formal balance sheet runoff announcement is likely, including the size of initial monthly runoff caps and the phase-in speed to their maximum level. We expect implementation in mid-May, with initial caps of $15 billion for UST and $10 billion for MBS, reaching the maximum pace of $60bn and $35bn, respectively, by mid-August. We expect Chair Powell to continue the Fed’s hawkish pivot by repeating recent concerns about the inflation-generating process and overheating labor markets,\" it said. Selloff in US stocks Friday saw US stocks tumbling 3-4 per cent, setting stage for a massive weakness in Asian market equities on Monday morning. For the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tanked over 900 points. Technology stocks added to Wall Street's losses, leaving the S&P500 with its biggest monthly skid since the start of the pandemic. The S&P500 fell 155.57 points, or 3.6 per cent, to 4,131.93 The Dow dropped 939.18 points or 2.8 per cent, to 32,977.21. The Nasdaq slid 536.89 points or 4.17 per cent to 12,334.64. Weak cues from Asia Financial markets in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia were closed on Monday for public holidays. Those that were opened, including Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul and Wellington, fell, though Manila ticked up. Japan's Nikkei 225, which was opened for trade, fell 0.53 per cent or 143.30 points to 143.30. The Korean benchmark Kospi fell 17.02 points, or 0.63 per cent, to 2,678.03, after losing as much as 1.01 per cent in early trade. Adding to the dour mood was data showing Chinese manufacturing activity shrank last month at its fastest pace since the start of the pandemic owing to Covid lockdowns in the country's biggest cities, Reuters reported. Technical weakness Analysts were largely negative on Nifty50 prospects. The level of 16,800 was seen as a big support level for the index. The NSE barometer had on Friday formed a Bearish Engulfing pattern on the daily chart and had settled below its 200-day and 50-day simple moving averages. On the weekly scale it formed a small bullish candle with a long upper wick, suggesting selling at higher levels. \"Nifty50 has been showing weak upside bounces after moving up from near the important supports of 16,800-16,900 levels recently. But having rejected from the upper range of 17,300-17,400 levels, the chances of it sliding down to the lower range is higher,\" Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities had said. LIC IPO, Q4 commentary The US Fed's meeting ends on May 4 (IST) and the public issue of India's largest financial institution LIC is also set to open on May 4. LIC's IPO could also have some impact on market liquidity though money managers don't see it as a major concern, ET reported. With the earnings season for the quarter ended March signalling that the coming months could be challenging for Indian companies, investors are taking a step back. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on sensex crash stock market crash sensex sensex nifty crash sensex news sensex | nifty (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "iStock NEW DELHI: Domestic benchmark equity indices tanked in Monday's session, taking May month losses to over 5 per cent. The fresh selling was seen as the rupee hit a record low of 77.13 per dollar and as S&P500 June futures fell nearly 1 per cent in morning trade. Investors were concerned over Fed rate hikes, which sent dollar higher and probably aided the Rs 6,417 crore equity outflows so far this month. At 9.20 am, the BSE Sensex was trading 830.73 points or 1.51 per cent lower at 54,004.85. It hit a low of 53,968.14 earlier in the day. Nifty50 was trading at 16,181.60, down 229.65 points or 1.4 per cent. Midcap and smallcap indices tanked up to 1.5 per cent. \"Honestly speaking, we did not expect the fall to extend below 16,500 but when global uncertainty comes, no level is respected. If we take a glance at the daily time frame chart, we can see ‘Pennant’ pattern target in the vicinity of 16,200-16,000, which is not far away from current level. Hence, we would rather wait for some reversal this week,\" said Sameet Chavan of Angel One. \"On the higher side, 16,500 followed by 16,700 are the immediate levels to watch out for,\" he added. Tech Mahindra fell 4.94 per cent to Rs 1,227.75. Tata Steel and IndusInd Bank declined 2.3 per cent each. Reliance Industries dropped 2.2 per cent to Rs 2,564. Wipro, TCS, and Axis Bank fell 2 per cent each. SBI, Larsen & Toubro, Maruti Suzuki, ICICI Bank, M&M, NTPC and Titan Company slipped up to 2 per cent. What hit the sentiment most was a fall in rupee to an all-time low against the greenback, thanks to rising US Treasury yields amid fears of an aggressive rate hike by the US Federal Reserve in June FOMC meet. The rupee depreciated to 77.1325 against the dollar in early trade. The Indian currency had closed at a record low of 76.98 on March 7. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of six major currencies, last traded at 103.98 against 103.79 in the previous day. \"If the downward spiral continues, Nifty50 weakness shall eventually extend to 16,180 at 78.6 retracement of the recent upside leg of March to April and then 16,000 level. To regain strength, the Nifty needs to bridge the day’s bearish gap in the zone of 16,480 and 16,620,\" YES Securities said in a note. Markets across Asia were down up to 2.5 per cent. Mainland China and Hong Kong markets were closed for the day on account of public holidays. Japanese Nikkei index was down 2.3 per cent. Taiwan and Korea markets fell up to 1.7 per cent. Australian shares were down 1.8 per cent. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on sensex crash stock market crash share market crash nifty crash sensex nifty stock market latest news Sensex Today (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

Show more » The carnage in the global markets intensified during the week and the bearish mood completely gripped D-Street as well. Nifty50 has corrected over 15% from its all-time high, and investors are wondering whether are we nearing the bottom or are markets set to get worse? Usually, when the market bottom is in sight, the sentiment is extremely pessimistic, with fear at its peak. It is a phase where investors are highly sceptical of pouring fresh funds into the market. Such scenarios are also marked by periods where markets decline on lower volumes and rise on higher volumes. However, currently, the consensus is still to buy the dip to ride the next rally indicating that greed is still alive. Further, volumes on lows are far from drying up. Also, if we look at the data of the past twenty years, apart from the event-based market crashes of 2008 and 2020, other corrections have had average drawdown levels of close to 25% in Nifty. Basis these historical precedences, there is still room for markets to fall. Additionally, S&P 500 has fallen more from its all-time high than the Nifty. The fact that Indian markets have fallen higher than S&P 500 in every major market fall further suggests that the bottom is still far. If markets are to reverse strongly, key triggers will be needed which in the current context could be the quick easing of inflation and a pause on the aggressiveness of interest rate hikes. Currently, there are no visible signs of such turning points. Therefore, it is unlikely that the markets are bottoming out. However, even if markets do rebound, there are strong resistance levels that will be difficult to breach, thereby, increasing the possibility of another relief rally. Therefore investors should be extremely cautious and should not interpret a relief rally as the end of this correction phase. Event of the week During the week, the spotlight was on India’s retail inflation which came in at 7.79% to an 8-year high, substantially jumping from the previous month’s number of 6.95%. The RBI has projected Q1FY23 inflation at 6.3% which is clearly now subject to modification in the upcoming June MPC meet. Given this inflation trajectory, our repo rate has a lot of catching up to do. RBI has already hiked repo rates by 40 bps in a surprise announcement and also indicated that they intend to get the repo rate back to pre-Covid levels. This signals that another hike of about 75 bps is already on cards. Further, other major central banks, including the US Fed, have signalled cumulative rate hikes of about 2%-2.5%. So for parity, our repo needs to be somewhere between 6%-6.5%, thus requiring additional rate hikes of about 150-200 bps over the next 12 to 18 months. Therefore, for the June meeting, it is likely that the repo will be hiked by another 25 bps at the minimum. Technical Outlook ET CONTRIBUTORS Nifty50 closed strongly negative for the week and Indian as well as major global indices have become oversold in the short term. Nifty is currently trading around a strong support zone of 15,700, which is the lower end of the downward sloping channel. Bank Nifty index is also trading around the rising trend line support drawn from the March 2020 low. Therefore, an immediate bounce in Nifty and Bank Nifty cannot be ruled out. Extremely aggressive traders may initiate long positions while maintaining a strict stop loss just below 15,700. The immediate resistance is now placed at 16,600. Expectations for the week As the result season nears its last leg, Dalal Street will focus on global cues to determine its direction. In India, WPI figures are expected to be released and the most awaited IPO, LIC will be listed on the bourses. Given the current market scenario, it is likely that LIC gets listed at a discount or close to its upper band. Further, if there are no positive catalysts next week, indices are projected to stay under pressure as markets have adopted a 'Sell on Rise' mentality. Investors are advised to stay on the sidelines, as in such difficult times it is better to wait out the storm rather than go bottom fishing.

    "article_content": "Sensex tanks over 1,000 pts on weak global cues; Nifty below 15,950; ITC rises post stellar Q4 show NEW DELHI: It was another rough day for the D-Street investors as benchmark indices logged their worst intra-day fall since March 2020 on Thursday. This is shaping up to be the most volatile year for the markets in over a decade so far as uncertainty about the impact of aggressive rate tightening whipsaws stocks. The 30-share pack Sensex nosedived 1,416.30 points or 2.61 per cent at 52,792.23. Its broader peer NSE Nifty shed 430.90 points or 2.65 per cent to post its worst day since February 24 and close near the 15,809.40 mark. Weak quarterly results elsewhere, including that of internet giant Tencent in China, added fuel to the fire. Domestic stocks eroded nearly Rs 6.36 lakh crore from investors’ kitty on Thursday. Data showed the BSE market capitalisation fell 6.3 lakh crore to Rs 249.40 lakh crore from Rs 255.7 lakh crore a day ago. ITC was the only stock in the Sensex pack to end with decent gains. The stocks ended 3.43 per cent higher after the company announced their March quarter results on Wednesday. Dr Reddy's and Power Grid finished the session marginally positive. \"The recent earnings reported by the US retailers reflected the heat of high retail inflation, resulting in the rout in Wall Street,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. Persistent offloading by foreign investors along with mounting fears of an economic slowdown wreaked havoc in the domestic market, he added. All sectoral indices also finished the session with deep cuts. Volatility index surged over 10 per cent to end near 2-month highs. Nifty's IT index was the top loser among sub-indexes with a fall of 5.8 per cent. IT majors Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Wipro were the top laggards on the Nifty 50, plunging over 5-6 per cent each. “In this highly volatile market, investors can focus on sectors like FMCG, Pharma, Capital goods and manufacturing whose valuations are moderate and reasonable on a long term basis,\" Nair said. Heavy falls in markets followed Wall Street's worst day since mid-2020 on Thursday, as stark warnings from some of the world's biggest retailers underscored just how hard inflation is biting. These top factors that weighed on the market today: Retailers hit Wall Street Weak results from US retailer Target has raised concerns over inflation eating into corporate earnings globally. A 25 per cent single-day plunge in shares of US retailer Target following its bleak results and commentary, and a consistent fall in bigger rival Walmart, was a reminder that ignoring inflation is no option now and steep earning downgrades globally are a real possibility. US Fed had in the past said it would increase US interest rates until there is \"clear and convincing\" evidence that inflation is in retreat. But increasing interest rate may also have its own ill-effects on US demand and could lead to recession in the world's largest economy. The Dow dropped 3.6 per cent while the Nasdaq fell 4.7 per cent overnight. The S&P500 plunged 4.04 per cent. The three indices were on pace to extend a string of at least six weekly losses. Tencent adds to Asia wounds If overnight fall in US stocks was bad, a sharp fall in shares of Chinese internet major Tencent was worse. China's Tencent's March quarter profit halved from a year ago and revenues stagnated, reflecting the impact of Covid-19 lockdowns in that country. On Thursday morning, Hong Kong was down 2.5 per cent, while Tokyo was down 2 per cent. Markets in Taiwan and Korea fell up to 2 per cent. Frontloading rate hike The minutes of the recent MPC policy review on Wednesday suggested frontloaded rate hikes ahead. Nomura India now expects a 50 basis points hike in June meet against 35 basis points earlier. \"More frontloaded rate hikes appear to be on their way, with the MPC keen, in our view, to take the repo rate to its pre-pandemic level of 5.15 per cent (from 4.40 per cent) soon,\" Nomura said. Nomura sees 35 bps rate hike in August, followed by a 25 bps rate hike each in October, December, February and April. It said risks are skewed to the upside, both in June (a 75 bps hike is live) and to its terminal rate forecast (of 6.25 per cent). Record low rupee & foreign outflows Record low rupee is weighing on foreign flows into the country. The partially convertible rupee stood at 77.6780 against the greenback and traded near all-time low levels. A weakening rupee makes investments in Indian equities unattractive to foreign investors. Foreign equity outflows in May have topped Rs 30,000 crore mark. For 2022, they stood at Rs 1,57,556 crore so far in 2022. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} In Video: Sensex tanks over 1,000 pts on weak global cues; Nifty below 15,950; ITC rises post stellar Q4 show Read More News on Market Investors stock market stock market latest news stock markets share markets sensex nifty sensex crash nifty crash stock market outlook (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "Broader market indices were trading in-line with their headline peers with Nifty Smallcap falling 0.87 per cent while Nifty Midcap dropped 0.64 per cent. Broadest index on NSE, Nifty 500 was down 0.62 per cent. In what turned out to be a Black Monday for investors on Dalal Street amid global macro headwinds, Sensex crashed over 1,700 points today to hit an intraday low of 52,569.57. The domestic headline equity index is down over 5,400 points so far in the calendar year 2022. While market gurus are divided over whether we are in the mid of a bear phase or a correction in a bull market that began in the aftermath of the Covid-led crash in March 2020, most experts believe that the weakness may continue ahead of the Fed meeting outcome on Wednesday. If the US inflation hitting a 40-year high of 8.6 per cent last week wasn't enough, China has started to re-impose Covid-19 restrictions once again which sent investors in Asia running for cover. Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Corporate Financial Services, said the sell-off was required as the Indian market continued to be overoptimistic in spite of all the global headwinds. “I think this is the first time we are seeing a very generalised selling. It is good for the market. Let the blood get out and let the weaker hands move out, and then only stronger hands will be left to hold on to equities,” he said. Monday Mayhem! Key factors behind 1,500 points Sensex crash Domestic stocks on Monday joined the global rout, sinking over 2 per cent, as data showed US inflation at fresh 40-year high in May at 8.6 per cent, weakening the narrative of 'peaking inflation' and opening up doors for aggressive Fed rate hikes ahead. VK Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services said that the near-term market trend is weak and such a scenario would be negative for risky assets like equity, particularly in the context of declining global growth. “The Indian market will stabilise only when the US market stabilises. Therefore, investors may wait and watch till clarity emerges,” he suggested. Asutosh Mishra, Head of Research, Institutional Equity, Ashika Group, said the market correction can be utilized as a good opportunity for investors to rejig their portfolios. “Focus on how in the past these deep corrections may have given us the opportunity to position ourselves for profitable trade or investing. If we look around us we will find many businesses whose prospects look good in these difficult times. Use this time to invest in top companies from these sectors.” Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart , said the fall is just a reality check as a majority of stock prices had moved far away from their fundamentals or intrinsic values. Although he expects markets to be volatile in the near term, he advocates buying the dip strategy. Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel One, says it has become a nightmare to trade stocks in the last couple of weeks. The pragmatic strategy, according to him, is to stay light on positions. (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

    "article_content": "iStock Amid fears that the Federal Reserve’s fight against inflation may lead the US economy into a recessionary trap, not just US stocks but even the MSCI ACWI Index, which contains stocks from both emerging and developed markets, officially slipped into bear territory this week. The S&P 500 is down more than 21 per cent from its record high and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has crashed 33 per cent from highs. Back home, the headline index Nifty50 is down around 15 per cent from its all-time high of 18,604.45 touched on October 19. Are Indian stocks also going to follow the mother market US? A fall of 20 per cent from the peak is treated as a bear zone. For Nifty , a dip below the threshold of 14,883 would mark that territory. Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services , said as globally markets are highly integrated, the largest market, US, sets the trend and others follow. “Markets have not yet discounted a full-blown US recession and its impact on corporate earnings. So, unless inflation shows signs of peaking and then declining, the bearish trends may persist,” he said. You Might Also Like: US stocks end mostly lower as markets await Fed rate hike Another Dalal Street veteran Vikas Khemani, Founder, Carnelian Capital Advisors, said India is positioned very differently this time around as compared to the last Fed cycle. “When the Fed started interest rates last time our current account deficit was 4 per cent of GDP and our domestic flows were not as strong as we have today. India’s structural growth story is the best in the world. I do not think there is any other market which offers this kind of growth story,” he said, adding that he sees no reason for the selloff to deepen in a major way. Mahesh Nandurkar, MD & Head of Research, Jefferies India, said India has actually been relatively a big outperformer. “But I think the news flow and the markets are still going to be weak,” he said, adding that the Indian market will yield zero returns in the next 12 months. Although domestic inflows have been strong, FPIs have already sold Indian equities worth Rs 1,91,000 crore so far this year. You Might Also Like: Another big rate hike seen as Fed begins 2-day meet Nandurkar, however, points out that foreign investors have sold only about 5 per cent of their holdings out of the total FII investment in India of more than $600 billion. “I would not be surprised if the FPI selling continues but there will be a worry if we see some signs of a slowdown in domestic flows,” he said. Vijayakumar says FPIs are not selling in India because they are negative on India. “India is one of the few EM markets where they are sitting on good profits and valuations in India are even now much higher than that of EM peers.” (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

    "article_content": "iStock As investors began digesting the implications of the US Fed 's rate hike roadmap and dovish commentary to fight inflation, Sensex plunged over 1,000 points and Nifty hit a new 52-week low of 15,335.10. The mood on Dalal Street was clearly bearish as out of 3,474 stocks traded on BSE , a vast majority of 2,756 stocks were trading in the negative. Investors turned poorer by about Rs 5.5 lakh crore as the market cap of BSE-listed firms dropped to Rs 239 lakh crore. Here are key factors behind the stock market crash today: Fed fear While hiking the interest rate by 75 basis points to a target range of 1/50%-1.75%, the Fed downgraded its US growth forecasts for 2022 and 2023 but remained adamant there would be no recession. \"The Fed’s dot plot was also moved higher with year-end rates expected to be 3.40% from 2.80% previously. That implies another 1.75% of hiking is still to come in 2022,\" said Jeffrey Halley, Senior Market Analyst, Asia Pacific, OANDA. FPI selloff Data showed foreign investors have sold equities to the tune of Rs 19,2104 crore so far this calendar. This includes Rs 24,949 crore worth of FPI sold in June so far. \"There might be a case of outflows from emerging markets and underperformance over the next 3 months,\" warned Caesar Maasry of Goldman Sachs. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services , said the sustained FPI selling is an additional headwind for Dalal Street. Global markets The fall in Nifty was in tune with what's happening in markets globally. Most Asian stocks also erased early gains as the focus shifted back to fears of recession. After a relief rally overnight, Dow Futures were trading 1.2 per cent lower. Chinese stocks also ended lower while UK's blue-chip FTSE 100 fell 0.5 per cent ahead of a Bank of England policy meeting expected to result in another interest rate hike. Japan's Nikkei, however, ended the day up 0.4 per cent to snap a four-day losing streak. Recession Worries Market experts are worried about whether the Fed's rate hike plan would be able to control inflation and whether it would lead to a recession. Dr VK Vijayakumar said the presently unknown factor is whether the rising rates will tip the US economy into recession. Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath questioned how would a Fed rate of 1.6 per cent with inflation at 8 per cent contain inflation. \"Higher rates discourage capex and borrowing, in theory, this should slow down the economy and curtail inflation. While inflation has averaged 7 per cent for the first half of the year, it would need to fall to 3 per cent abruptly to get it to the short-term 5 per cent target,\" he said. Earlier this week, a survey had showed that the US economy will tip into a recession next year as the Fed tries to control inflation which is at its highest level in the last 40 years. Technical weakness The March low of 15,671 had not been breached on a closing basis for three straight sessions but Nifty50 has not only breached that level intraday, but has also tested its support of 15,400. The weakness, if extended, could lead to test of 15,300 and 15,100 levels. Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities had on Wednesday suggested that said the short term trend of Nifty50 remained weak. \"The lack of strength at the important support suggests chances of false downside breakout or one leg of downside.\" #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on nifty crash fpi fed bse powell sensex crash Sensex Crash Today sensex nifty geojit financial services (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "iStock Stocks came crashing as oil prices surged 4 per cent, tracking an overnight double-digit fall for Russian stocks and heavy selling in Europe. NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices broke below their 200-day moving averages amid the fifth day of fall on Dalal Street today, and in the process wiped nearly Rs 6 lakh crore off investor wealth . The BSE market capitalisation hit a low of Rs 251.72 lakh crore in Tuesday's trade, which was down Rs 5.67 lakh crore over Monday's levels. Since February 16's closing value of Rs 262.19 lakh crore, stock investors have lost Rs 10.46 lakh crore in fortune. On Tuesday, the BSE Sensex fell nearly 1,300 points intraday, falling below its crucial 200-day simple moving average. Nifty50, which tested 16,850 level at open, was also quoting below its crucial average. The fresh round of selling was triggered by the Russian move to recognise two breakaway regions, Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine and the deployment of its troops there to \"keep the peace\". \"I recall a similar script was played by Russia in 2008 when the then Georgian government headed by pro-US President Sakaashvili was making similar noises as the current Ukrainian government of joining NATO and EU. The war between the Russia-backed separatists and Georgia was swiftly followed by recognition by Russia of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent, sovereign Republics,\" said independent analyst Ajay Bodke, who warned about such a possibility in a February 16 note. You Might Also Like: Sensex, Nifty extend losses to 5th day tracking Russia-Ukraine tensions; realty, metals worst hit Bodke said: Then as now, Putin had said that NATO's enlargement towards Russia would be taken in Russia as a direct threat to the security of our country. \"Escalations in Ukraine tensions with Russia recognising two pro-Russian rebel regions have aggravated the crisis. The economic consequences are already visible in higher crude and gold prices. The situation remains fluid; we don't know whether the tensions will escalate or be contained from now on,\" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. Stocks came crashing as oil prices surged 4 per cent, tracking an overnight double-digit fall for Russian stocks and heavy selling in Europe. \"Crude may remain volatile as market players assess risks associated with Russia, but the general bias may remain on the upside unless there are serious efforts to de-escalate tensions,\" said Ravindra Rao of Kotak Securities.

    "article_content": "ETMarkets.com “This is not a bear market, nor a bull market. It is just the stock market.” Even as the Sensex is down only about 11% from its record high of 62,245 touched in mid-October last year, value investor Vijay Kedia says the stock market has been in a bear grip for investors in the small and midcap space for the last 4-6 months. “If you are an investor in midcaps and smallcaps, then you might be feeling like you are already in a bear market that is 4-6 months old. You will find a lot of shares in BSE500 that are down by up to 50%. Now it is getting reflected in the primary index as well and that's why investors are panicking. The Russia-Ukraine war is just an excuse for this market to fall. It could have found some other excuses as well,\" Kedia told ETMarkets.com in an interview. Questioning the definition of bull and bear markets, he said everybody defines it according to their own portfolios. He said investors in certain largecap IT stocks might be thinking that this is a red hot bull market (barring today's correction), but if you have stocks like Tech Mahindra or Tata Steel, then it has been a lacklustre market for you like the one in 2012-13. “In mid and smallcaps there are many stocks that have fallen by up to 70%. If you are invested in those pockets, it would be nothing less than the 2008 bear market that resulted after the Lehman Brothers crisis. In Nasdaq, new-age stocks have fallen by up to 80%.” In market language, when an index closes 10 per cent or more below its record closing level it is considered as a correction while a 20 per cent dip from the top is treated as a bear market.

It is just the stock market.” Past trends indicate that themes which lead the bull market get battered the most when market reverses and remain an underperformer for a long time. Buy the dip? When asked which sectors should investors eye during this current phase of weakness, he gave the example of cement companies, private banks and pharma stocks. “I think that the stocks that have fallen by up to 60-70%, bear market may end soon for them. It is time to buy such stocks. In the next 2-4 months, whether there is a war in Ukraine or some other crisis, it doesn't matter as these stocks are already in the buying range,\" said the Mumbai-based investor known for picking multibaggers at an early stage.

These companies can't report hyper growth every year. 2021 was spent in so much optimism that people thought it will keep on repeating 50% growth again next year. In a bull market, investors ignore reasons that can lead to a bear market. As sense prevails, prudent investors move out. Retail investors buy at peak,” Kedia said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to put his nuclear forces on a higher alert in reaction to the latest stiff measures also weighed on the sentiment. WTI crude surged 5.1 per cent to $96.23 per barrel while Brent advanced 4.3 per cent to $102.14 per barrel on Monday morning. The development is negative for India, which imports a majority of its crude requirements. At 9.30 am, BSE Sensex was ruling at 54,938.42, down 920.10 points or 1.65 per cent. The NSE Nifty stood at 16,373.95, down 284.45 points or 1.71 per cent. \"While both Ukraine and Russian representatives have agreed to meet at the Ukraine-Belarus border with 'no preconditions', volatility is likely to continue in Indian markets,\" said YES Securities. Bharti Airtel declined 2.77 per cent to Rs 669. HDFC Bank, Dr Reddy's Labs, Bajaj Finserv, and Asian Paints dropped up to 2.3 per cent. SBI, Axis Bank, HDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Maruti Suzuki fell up to 1.3 per cent.

The fresh sanctions on Russia include blocking select Russian banks from the Swift international payments system. Analysts noted that Russia has accelerated the use of its own payment cards, like Mir, as well as its own SWIFT-like System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS) messaging service. However, both currently only operate domestically, leaving vulnerability to potential frictions around cross-border transactions in other currencies, Goldman Sachs said recently. \"A bank run has already started in Russia over the weekend, and the Ruble, if it actually trades today, will be well above $100 to the dollar. Inflation will immediately spike massively, and the Russian banking system is likely to be in trouble,\" said Jeffrey Halley, Senior Market Analyst, Asia Pacific, OANDA. Midcap stocks such as Sona BLW Precision Forgings, Endurance Technologies, Lodha, Shriram Transport and Rajesh Exports declined up to 4 per cent. Smallcaps Rain Industries, OnMobile Global, Man Industries, JM Financial and Vakrangee declined up to 10 per cent. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Sensex Crash Today sensex nifty crash today sensex crash nifty crash stock market crash share market share market today share market news stock market latest news (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "AP Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell NEW DELHI: Domestic equity indices closed lower on Monday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his Jackson Hole speech made it clear that the fight against inflation is not over and that the Fed is likely to keep raising interest rates to stamp out inflation. The 30-share pack Sensex dropped 861.25 points to close at 57,972.62. Its broader peer, Nifty50, slipped below the 16,350 mark. Reliance closed 0.84 per cent lower after the company's 45th AGM. The sell-off eroded investors' wealth by over Rs 2.28 lakh crore as BSE's m-cap plunged to Rs 274.67 lakh crore from Rs 276.96 lakh crore on Friday. Tech Mahindra was the biggest loser from the 30-share pack, tanking 4.57 per cent to Rs 1036.05, Infosys fell 3.93 per cent, Wipro was down 3.06 per cent and HCL Tech fell 2.98 per cent. TCS, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Tata Steel were also among the stocks that settled with cuts. On the other hand, Maruti rose 1.30 per cent to Rs 8,832.35. Nestle rose 0.52 per cent, followed by Asian Paints, up 0.50 per cent, and ITC, rising 0.24 per cent, respectively. Sectorally, the Nifty IT index declined 3.53 per cent, while Nifty Bank fell 1.82 per cent. Nifty Media and Metal also settled lower. Here are some other factors weighing on the market: Sensex crashes 1,300 points, Nifty cracks below 17,200; IT stocks tumble up to 5% Sensex crashes 1,300 pts on Powell’s hawkish pivot; Nifty cracks below 17,200; IT stocks tumble up to 5%; YES Bank, Tata Steel, Vodafone Idea, RBL Bank among most active stocks on NSE. Fed commentary V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said the market expected Powell to remain hawkish at Jackson Hole but the ultra-hawkish tone of the Fed chief's message and his warnings that Fed's policy will \"cause some pain to households and businesses\" and this is \"the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation\" were not expected and factored-in by the market. Chair Powell’s speech at the 2022 Jackson Hole Economic Symposium broadly largely met analyst expectations and reinforced view that the Fed will remain hawkish, even as the economy enters recession later this year. Nomura India in a note shared four key highlights. Nomura said the Fed is now shifting towards a period of “purposefully” raising rates to a “higher for longer” stance after “expeditious” (larger than 25 bps) rate hikes this year. It noted the Fed sees a greater need to keep rates restrictive for some time to ensure inflation does not become further entrenched. \"Third, previous Fed tightening episodes suggest participants will not begin to ease their restrictive stance prematurely until actual inflation moderates, with an important emphasis on the experience of the 1970s and 1980s,\" Nomura said. Rupee depreciation The domestic currency fell 26 paise to a low of 80.10 against dollar in early trade. This was in line with other Asian currencies, which fell as a result of strengthening dollar following Powell's comments suggesting the Fed would raise rates as high as needed and would keep them there \"for some time\" to bring down inflation near its medium-term goal. The dollar index, which tracks the movement of the greenback against a basket of six major world currencies, rose 0.47 per cent to 109.31 level. Anindya Banerjee, VP, Currency Derivatives and Interest Rate Derivatives at Kotak Securities said A strong US Dollar Index, high US bond yields with a deeply inverted yield curve and weak equity markets all makes it challenging for FPI and carry trade flows in EMs. \"However, the speed of the up move will be closely regulated by RBI. RBI has twin objectives of not letting the rupee become a weak outlier and also, they do not want the USD-INR to become too volatile. This means they may continue to sell USD as the spot and forwards moves to a fresh all-time high. However, this may not alter the trajectory of the pair and the path of least resistance would remain upward. We expect a range of 79.70 and 80.50 over the next 1-2 weeks,” he said. FPI outflow fears Dollar generally shares inverse relation with stocks. Besides, when the dollar rises, inflows to emerging markets fall, as a weakening domestic currency eats into FPI returns. Provisional data showed foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were sellers of domestic stocks to the tune of Rs 51.12 crore on Friday. They have pumped a net Rs 49,254 crore into Indian equities till August 26 this month. Still they are net sellers of equities to the tune of Rs 1,63,115 crore so far this month. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading 0.51 per cent higher at 109.35. Technical weakness Analysts had warned that the weakness would be confirmed on a close below its 20-day SMA (17,418), which the bulls had managed to defend in the recent fall from the highs of 17,992. On Monday, the 50-pack index hit a low of 17,166.20. It was yet to be seen when the index closes below its 20-day SMA. Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in on Friday warned that in such a scenario, a bigger correction with initial targets of 16,950 looks inevitable. In a note , Sameet Chavan of Angel One said one should avoid trading aggressively. \"A breakdown below the sacrosanct support of 17,350 would extend the corrective phase towards the major support zone of 17,100–17,000,\" he said .

    "article_content": "iStock New Delhi: Domestic equity markets plunged sharply at the opening tick on Wednesday, in line with Asian peers, after higher-than-expected US inflation numbers sparked a global selloff. The 30-share pack Sensex plunged more than 1,150 points to open at 59,417.12, whereas NSE's barometer tanked more than 180 points to 17,887.70. However, both benchmark indices recovered partially. Investors lost nearly Rs 3 lakh crore at open as the total market capitalization of BSE dropped below Rs 284 lakh crore, which was Rs 286.71 lakh crore at the end of Tuesday's session. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said that the 4.32 per cent and 5.12 per cent cut in S&P 500 and Nasdaq yesterday again reminds us that there is more uncertainty about inflation and growth and more volatility ahead for markets. “The worse-than-expected CPI inflation data in the US, despite cooling gas prices, was a surprise. Now the market fears that inflation is getting entrenched and an ultra-hawkish Fed might trigger a hard landing for the US economy,” Vijaykumar said. Here are the key factors that led to the sell-off on Dalal Street: Rout in global stocks US stock market sank sharply on Tuesday after steaming hot inflation numbers. They recorded their worst fall since June 2020 following Wall Street’s humbling realization that inflation is not slowing as much as hoped. Asian markets, too, opened with big cuts on Wednesday. Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul, Taipei and Sydney all opened sharply lower at the start of trading. Inflation data Monthly US consumer prices unexpectedly rose in August as declining gasoline prices were offset by gains in the costs of rent and food, giving cover for the Federal Reserve to deliver another hefty interest rate increase next Wednesday. Prices rose 8.3 per cent in the 12 months through August, the Labor Department said, faster than the 8.1 per cent that economists had expected. Higher than expected readings disappointed the traders. Rate hike fears Traders across the globe are expecting the US Federal Reserve to continue to remain hawkish in taming the rising prices with aggressive rate hikes in the days to come. The Fed, some say, may even surprise with a 100 basis points (bps) hike. The US Fed is likely to deliver another 75-basis-point interest rate hike next week and likely hold its policy rate steady for an extended period once it eventually peaks, according to a Reuters poll. This cements the third straight 75-bps hike. On the domestic front, market participants expect a 50 bps rate hike from the Reserve Bank of India, as inflation numbers sprang to 7 per cent in August 6.71 per cent a month earlier. Stronger dollar The dollar climbed further against the rupee on Wednesday amid a jump in US yields after hotter-than-expected inflation boosted bets for even more aggressive monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve next week. The dollar index, which measures the currency against six major peers, was hovering near 110 levels, after surging sharply overnight and its biggest one-day percentage gain since March 2020. \"Downsides extended only as far as 78.99, before pulling back. Favoured view expects such upswing to be challenged in the 79.60-79.70 region. However, upward bias could persist should 79.4 hold,\" Anand James - Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. Technical outlook The turn lower cautioned in a note yesterday after peeping into the 18,040-160 band is poised to unfold today. The catchment area is 17,860, said James from Geojit. \"Successful pull back above this region later in the day could set the 18,600 trajectory back in motion. Inability to do so could signal extended downsides toward 17,520 in the next few days, but a collapse is still not among the favoured moves,\" he added.

    "article_content": "Agencies Swinging in between highs and lows, the headline equity index Nifty is now back to where it was at the end of the calendar year 2021. As Nifty slipped below its 50-DMA or daily moving average and ended at 17,327.35 points on Friday, it is now 26.65 points below the 31st December closing of 17,354. Sensex , which ended near the 58,100 mark, has also eroded all gains earned this year as the US Fed is seen maintaining its aggressive stance at its next policy review. The only index that ended in the green during the day was the fear gauge index India VIX which shot up over 9%. PSU banks, realty, financial services and media stocks were among the worst hit during the selloff. After hitting an all-time peak of 18,604.45 on October 19 last year, Nifty hit a 52-week low of 15,183.40 earlier on June 17. When seen on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the Indian market has proved to be much more resilient than other global markets or even Asian/emerging peers. The S&P 500 has lost over 21% so far in 2022. \"With aggressive monetary policy action by central banks, the global growth engines are in a slowdown mode, whereas India is currently in a better position with a pickup in credit growth and an uptick in tax collection. The current volatility might persist for a while. Investors are advised to wait and watch until the dust settles,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services .

    "article_content": "iStock NEW DELHI: Over Rs 3 lakh crore worth of investor wealth was wiped off on Dalal Street on Monday morning as Sensex plunged over 800 points to hit the day's low at 57,365.68. The selloff comes amid weak global cues following a solid US September jobs report which raised fears about aggressive rate hikes by the US Fed. The total market capitalisation of all companies listed on BSE dropped by Rs 3.11 lakh crore to Rs 272.5 lakh crore. Here are key factors dragging the stock market lower today: Fed fear after jobs data Fears around aggressive rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve were back to haunt investors as the surprisingly low US unemployment rate at 3.5 per cent implies that the Fed will have to continue raising interest rates longer than the markets had discounted. Pricing of futures tied to the Fed's policy rate implied a 92% chance that the Fed will raise its policy rate, now at 3%-3.25%, to a 3.75%-4% range when it meets on Nov 1-2. If the fears are true, then Powell will deliver a fourth straight 75-basis point interest rate hike next month. \"The paradoxical construct of good economic news turning out to be bad news for markets played out again last Friday in the US,\" said Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services . FII selling Having sold Indian equities worth over Rs 7,600 crore last month, foreign institutional investors or FIIs were net sellers to the tune of Rs 2,251 crore on Friday amid a depreciating rupee. Crude oil prices Benchmark Brent crude futures jumped more than 11% last week after the Saudi-led production cartel agreed to cut production. Inching closer to the $100 a barrel mark once again, Brent was trading at $97 on Monday morning. Rupee fall The Indian rupee fell 38 paise to hit a lifetime low of 82.62 against the US dollar on Monday. The domestic currency is down over 11% so far in the calendar year 2022. The US dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of 6 currencies, was trading near the 113 mark. Bond yields Yields on 10-year US Treasury notes inched towards 3.90% and the two-year note at 4.3% in anticipation that the Fed will keep its resolve to tighten monetary policy. \"The labour market is still strong and inflation is not dropping quickly, which still means the Fed could take rates as high as 5% and that will break parts of the economy,\" said Edward Moya, Senior Market Analyst, OANDA. Global markets The mood was subdued in the Asian markets where Japan and South Korea were shut for a holiday. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 1.4%. On Friday, Dow Jones had ended over 2% lower. Technical factors Analysts said Nifty had resistance around the 17,400 mark. Now the biggest make-or-break support is placed at 17,000 and below the same, the index could slip quickly to the 16,747-16,775 zone. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on sensex crash today sensex nifty nifty crash today stock market selloff geojit financial services (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "iStock Domestic benchmark indices opened in the red on Thursday, tracking a four-day fall in US stocks, thanks to rate hike worries. Data showed a 13.5 per cent growth in June quarter GDP failed to offer support to the indices. At 9.17 am, the BSE Sensex was trading 744.07 points or1.25 per cent lower at 58,793. Nifty50 was trading at 17,564.95, down 194.35 points or 1.09 per cent. V K Vijayakumar , Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said that a highlight of the recent market trend is India's outperformance among large markets. While the US, Europe and most large emerging markets have turned weak, the Indian market has shown surprising resilience. “Since the US Fed chief Jerome Powell 's ultra-hawkish message last Friday the S&P 500 is down 5.8 per cent while the Nifty is up 0.9 per cent. A major factor driving this outperformance is the return of FIIs into the Indian market. It is important to appreciate the fact that the FIIs investment of Rs 4,165 crore on Tuesday in the cash market is the largest buy figure in 2022. This is providing momentum to the market,” Vijayakumar said. However, investors have to exercise caution since valuations are high and the global growth environment is not favorable for a sustained bull market. Even while remaining invested, some profit booking may be a good idea, Vijayakumar added. Among Sensex stocks, Infosys fell 2.31 per cent to Rs 1,458.16. TCS, Reliance Industries and HDFC down 2.10 per cent, 1.75 per cent and 1.58 per cent, respectively. ICICI Bank, HCL Tech and HDFC Bank declined 1.64 per cent, 1.49 per cent and 1.47 per cent, respectively. The dollar index, which tracks the movement of the greenback against a basket of six major world currencies, rose 0.27 per cent to 108.99 level.

    "article_content": "ETMarkets.com “We are in for a trend change in the market and as I have been pointing out from August-September, the rally from June lows is really just a corrective rally . There are a few cracks that are appearing on the banking heavyweights like ICICI and SBI . If the banking index starts trading below 41,800, that will be a trend change there too,” says Jai Bala , Chief Market Technician, Cashthechaos .com. In the last one hour, the market neared the day’s lowest point; the PSU bank index has erased all its gains and 5% down from the day’s highest point. Where do you see markets headed and what are the key levels one should watch out for in benchmark indices right now? The key level for the Nifty is 18130 at close, we are in for a trend change in the market and as I have been pointing out from August-September, the rally from June lows is really just a corrective rally. Although the markets made new 52-week highs or new record highs, it is a deceptive one and unless one understands technicals, it is difficult to understand that it was a continuation of the corrective move that started from October 2021. If the markets break 18,130, we are resuming the downtrend and we are probably going to go below the June lows. There are a few cracks that are appearing on the banking heavyweights like ICICI and SBI. If the banking index starts trading below 41,800, that will be a trend change there too. This was just a corrective rally and the corrective rally is probably coming close to an end. .jumptextrow, .jumplinkwrap{margin:15px 0;} article.artData .artText table td {vertical-align:middle} Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO Courses Offering College Course Website Indian School of Business ISB Chief Technology Officer Visit Indian School of Business ISB Chief Digital Officer Visit IIM Lucknow Chief Executive Officer Programme Visit But in this particular time from the June lows, the PSU bank index has performed fantastically well and not just SBI. Some of the smallcap names in the PSU banking index have done phenomenally well for themselves. Is it time to get cautious on these particular names? Yes, definitely. The PSU banks might have a little bit of steam left but it is not for people who are trying to make fresh entries here; it is for people who have already been long in the PSU stocks and they can probably hold on with trading stops. Te PSU index might possibly push for one more high beyond 4600 but it is not a great risk reward from this point onwards and one has to be very specific. Something like a Central Bank, Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank might have fresh 52- week highs coming but in other PSU banking stocks there may not be steam left. So it is time to be quite cautious over there. What is your take on the broader markets because over the last few weeks, it was actually trying to outperform the benchmarks but where do you see broader markets headed from here on? , do you see this sort of an outperformance sustaining for the broader markets or one should be cautious there as well? That is a very important aspect. If you are looking at Nifty Smallcap 50 or the Nifty Smallcap 250 they are off the all time highs from somewhere between 8% and 21% depending on which index one is looking at. They have already been underperforming and once the heavyweights start dragging the markets lower, the underperformance of the broader markets will continue.

    "article_content": "Agencies NEW DELHI: The Christmas cheer that has been part of Dalal Street's history in December month for 80% of the time in the last two decades is clearly missing in 2022 with the Sensex down nearly 2,000 points in just 4 days. The headline index has lost around 3,250 points or 5.1% so far in the month. The Sensex ended 981 points lower at 59,845.29, while Nifty50 ended at 17,806.80 on Friday. Going by the bearish sentiments, Santa rally , which is usually associated with a surge in stock prices during the last five trading days of December and the first 2 days of January, appears unlikely in the market now. Nifty , which is among the world's best performing index globally, is now reversing its outperformance vis-à-vis the other markets and breached the 18,000 mark today. Here are 6 key factors driving the stock market lower: 1) US data Data from US on consumer confidence, jobless claims, and Q3 GDP numbers surprised on the upside but it also means that it also increases the risks of more Fed rate hikes. US Q3 GDP recorded a growth of 3.2%, above the estimate of 2.9%. Initial jobless claims rose slightly to 216,000, a beat of the 222,000 estimate. \"Global coordinated central bank tightening has yet to fully impact most of the economic readings for the major economies and that should have investors nervous over earnings downgrades and credit risks,\" said market analyst Edward Moya of OANDA. 2) Covid fears Fears related to Covid have also started troubling investors once again as the infection rages through China. Bloomberg had yesterday reported that China is likely seeing 1 million Covid cases and 5,000 deaths a day. There is an element of overreaction in the market to the Covid news, said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services . Back home, the Indian government has also stepped up vigil saying that the battle against Covid is not over yet. 3) Japan inflation Putting Asian markets under pressure was Japan's core consumer inflation data which hit a fresh 40-year high of 3.7% in November as companies continued to pass on rising costs to households. Japan's Nikkei lost over 1% in its worst week since mid-June. 4) Wall Street cues Amid fears related to Fed rate hikes, the Dow Jones ended with a downside of over 1% while the cut was sharper in the Nasdaq at 2.18%. The benchmark S&P 500 is on track for a 19.8% annual drop, which would be its biggest since the 2008 financial crisis. Besides upbeat economic data, a warning from hedge-fund titan David Tepper that he was “leaning short” against both stocks and bonds also spooked investors. 5) Technical factors Suggesting a rise in pessimism on Dalal Street, headline equity index Nifty today formed a bearish engulfing pattern on the daily chart on Thursday. Nifty had strong support at 18,000 mark, which was breached today. Option data suggests a shift in wider trading range in between 17500 to 18300 zones while an immediate range in between 17600 to 18100 zones. 6) Year-end pressure Nifty is feeling pressure on rises as investors rush to take profits and raise cash ahead of the month, quarter and calendar year-end, said Deepak Jasani of HDFC Securities.

I believe more selling pressure is likely to be seen in Muthoot Finance. So go short at the current market price. Another stock I am looking for on the short side is Britannia . For the last three days, we are witnessing lower tops and lower bottom formations and is on the verge of giving a breakdown of 20 DMAs as well,” says Swati Ananda Hotkar , AVP-Equity Technical Research, Nirmal Bang Securities . What is your view on the market after three-four days of continuous selling? As of now, the view on the market is a little bit cautious because of the Covid news. Yesterday, Nifty broke its 50-day moving average and today it has touched its 100-day moving average which comes at around 17,850 levels. Somehow as of now, Nifty has managed to take a support but if it breaks that level, then it might take Nifty towards 17,500. On a higher side, 18,000 will act as a crucial resistance zone. .jumptextrow, .jumplinkwrap{margin:15px 0;} article.artData .artText table td {vertical-align:middle} Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO Courses Offering College Course Website IIM Lucknow Chief Executive Officer Programme Visit Indian School of Business ISB Chief Technology Officer Visit IIM Lucknow Chief Operations Officer Programme Visit Initially it was considered as a support but now going ahead, it will act as a resistance level. As long as Nifty will trade below the 18,000 psychological mark on the closing basis, we will remain cautious. As of now, we are witnessing a volatile trading session with immense pressure into the market because of the Covid news. One should stick to the market with quality stocks and trade with strict stop losses. On Friday, Bank Nifty had given a breakdown of 42,000 psychological support level marks which gives a very cautious side indication on the technical front. This rally is likely to be extended on the downside towards at least minimum 41500-41200 levels. So, these are the targets I am looking for between the coming weeks. The view on both the indices will remain cautious and stock specific. The market breadth is not doing very well. The 1:4 ratio is there. So the overall view is a little bit cautious. We are not initiating a major long position in this kind of a market because we believe that the downfall is likely to be continued in the coming week as well. You Might Also Like: 4 sectors on Sandip Sabharwal’s radar as the market stumbles Considering this view, today I am giving two short calls; one is on Muthoot Finance. Yesterday, the stock gave the breakdown of 50-DMA. It is currently trading below that level. I believe more selling pressure is likely to be seen in Muthoot Finance. So go short at the current market price. It will reach up to Rs 1,000 to 990 levels in the coming one to two trading sessions. So, one can go for short at the current market price and stop loss can be kept at Rs 1,080. Another stock I am looking for on the short side is Britannia, which has given a very good rally in the past few weeks but for the last three days, we are continuously witnessing lower tops and lower bottom formations and today it is on the verge of giving a breakdown of 20 DMAs as well. I believe we are likely to witness more profit booking into this particular stock and one can go for a short at the current market price. Stop loss can be kept at Rs 4,260. I am looking for a target of Rs 4,400-4,380 levels and those levels are the future levels just keep in mind. Given the fact that you have a very cautious stance for the coming week do you think it is better to play the large cap names and the small cap names will be under pressure or do you expect a bit of a recovery given the fact that we have seen sharp cuts in the small cap, midcap space? As of now we are just staying away from the small caps and the midcaps because we are not finding any good rally into this particular counters. I will suggest to all the clients that stick to the quality stocks large cap stocks only whether this kind is just a price correction. I am saying that because we have seen a very good amount of rally into the largest cap so the profit booking cannot be denied at the higher level. Let the market settle down, no need to be a major chaos at the current levels. The largecaps momentum rally is likely to be continued in the coming trading session, which is concentrated in largecaps itself because whenever the Nifty and the Bank Nifty start giving the pullback, these stocks will be the first to participate in pullback rally. So better stick to the largecaps..

    "article_content": "iStock NEW DELHI: After being in the green zone for two days, panic gripped Dalal Street today as the new year party fizzled out ahead of the release of US Federal Reserve minutes tonight. Equity indices closed in the red on Wednesday owing to heavy selling across all sectoral indices. The BSE Sensex ended 636 points or 1.04% lower at 60,826, and Nifty 50 closed with cuts of 190 points or 1.04% at 18,127. Investors were left poorer by Rs 2.91 lakh crore as the market capitalisation of all BSE- listed companies declined to Rs 281.74 lakh crore. From the Sensex pack, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Wipro and Power Grid were the top losers, falling over 2%. Infosys, HDFC Bank, Reliance, HDFC, IndusInd Bank and ITC also closed lower. On the other hand, Maruti and TCS are the only stocks that managed to close with gains. Sectorally, the Nifty Realty fell 2.27% and Nifty Metal declined 1.24%. Auto, banks, financial services, pharma, consumer durables, oil & gas, FMCG and IT stocks also closed with cuts. Whereas, in the broader market, Nifty Midcap50 declined 1.23% and Smallcap50 1.07%. “The domestic market, affected by the worries in the global market, traded with deep cuts. Fears over aggressive rate hikes resurfaced ahead of the release of Fed meeting minutes, a meeting that left the door open for additional hikes,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. “Apart from global cues, the domestic market will pay close attention to corporate earnings. India’s services PMI expanded to 58.5 in December owing to stronger growth in new business,” Nair added. Earlier Asian markets ended on a mixed note, Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.45%, while China’s Shanghai Composite surged 0.22% and South Korea’s Kospi rose 1.68%. The rupee edged higher against the dollar on Wednesday, propped up by a slide in oil prices and the dollar index. The rupee ended at 82.80 per dollar, having firmed to as much as 82.75 during the session. The Brent crude March futures declined 2.29% to $80.22 per barrel. The market breadth was skewed in favour of bears. About 2,266 stocks declined, 1,228 gained and 133 remained unchanged. Bears ruled the Street even as the decline in US 10-year bond yield to 3.75 % and Brent declining to $81 are positives for investors. Here are 6 key factors dragging Sensex and Nifty lower today: 1) Fed minutes Investors are anxiously awaiting the release of Fed minutes of the December meeting, which would hint whether the US central bank has slowed down its tightening path. \"Inflation might prove to be harder to bring down and that should keep the risks elevated that the recession that hits the US economy could be harsher than what most are anticipating. The Fed will remain loud and clear that a lot of work remains to bring down inflation,\" said Edward Moya of OANDA. 2) US recession The fears of recession in the US and Europe remain the No. 1 risk for investors in 2023. With the increasing fears around recession, gold prices hit a 6-month high in the international market on Tuesday. 3) Technical factors Technical analysts said the 18,000 level remained as the crucial support zone for Nifty. Nifty’s biggest make-or-break intraday support is now placed at 17971 mark. Yesterday's chart setup didn't indicate any directional move. \"Over the short term, the index is likely to move within the range of 17,950-18,400. A breakout on either side will confirm a directional move,\" said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities . 4) Global markets US stocks edged lower on Tuesday with the biggest drags from Tesla and Apple, finishing up the new year’s first trading session with an all too familiar 2022 pattern of volatile moves that trend downward amid worries about high inflation and a possible recession. The S&P 500 fell 0.40% while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.76%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei lost 1.12%, while Australia's resource heavy S&P/ASX 200 index rose 1.63%. 5) FII selling According to preliminary data made public on the NSE , foreign institutional investors (FII) were again on the sell side in yesterday’s trade, bringing their last seven days of selling to the tune of Rs 6,605 crore. 6) Rupee The Indian rupee was trading marginally down in the spot market at 82.87 against the US dollar today. The domestic currency had fallen almost below the 83-level following a rally in the US dollar index. (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

    "article_content": "Getty Images After taking a short breather last week, the market resumed its upmove and went on to post decent gains over the past five sessions. However, concerns about the persistently declining value of VIX and the consequent vulnerability that it lends to the market remain. This week, the VIX tested its pre-pandemic 2020 lows. Nifty 's trading range got a bit wider on anticipated lines. It oscillated in 476.65-point range. Nifty, which gained on all five days, went on to post a decent gain of 441 points (+2.50) on a weekly basis. For the month, it rose 705 points (+4.06%). Things now get more precarious than before. Nifty has bounced off from the 200-DAY MA which is placed at 17,655 making this point an important support for the index. On the weekly charts, it has held 100-Week MA as a support which is currently at 17214. This makes 17214-17655 a strong support area for Nifty in the event of any corrective move. ET CONTRIBUTORS Importantly, India VIX continued its decline. This week it slipped below 11 to close at 10.95 by losing 5.87% through the week. This is a precariously low level. India VIX has also tested the pre-pandemic 2020 lows and this now stays overdue for a spike. While we continue to chase the up moves, one must never forget that any spike in the VIX can leave the markets extremely vulnerable to sharp profit-taking bouts. The coming week is a short week. Indian markets would open on Tuesday as Monday is a trading holiday on account of Maharashtra Day. The levels of 18,130 and 18,250 will act as important resistance points. The supports will come in at 17,900 and 17,710 levels. The trading range is likely to get wider this week. The weekly RSI is 56.29; it has marked a new 14-period high which is bullish. However, it continues to stay neutral against the price. The MACD is bearish and below the signal line. The narrowing Histogram, however, shows this indicator is on the verge of a positive crossover. The pattern analysis of the weekly chart shows that the after taking a short breather, Nifty has resumed its up-move and it remains above the small falling channel that it had formed for itself. In broader terms, the combined reading of the daily and weekly chart shows that the zone of 17,650-17,250 is a strong support area for the index in the event of any retracement. Although there are no visible signs of any indications that the market may correct, the dangerously low levels of the India VIX have left it vulnerable to almost certain, overdue, sharp profit-taking bout over the coming days. As we approach the coming week, we must be chasing the up-moves very cautiously. It is just a matter of time before we might see ourselves getting caught on the wrong side of the trade. The long players should very strictly trail their stop losses. Any fresh purchases should be kept very stock-specific and preferably outside the front-line indices. It is time that we get ultra-selective in our approach toward the markets and protect all profits in an extremely vigilant manner. A cautious outlook is advised for the coming week. In our look at Relative Rotation Graphs®, we compared various sectors against CNX500 (Nifty 500 Index), which represents over 95% of the free float market cap of all the stocks listed. ET CONTRIBUTORS ET CONTRIBUTORS The analysis of Relative Rotation Graphs (RRG) shows that Nifty Midcap 100, Infrastructure, FMCG, Financial Services, and Nifty PSE Indices are inside the leading quadrant . Though these groups may continue to relatively outperform the broader markets, many are seen giving up on their relative momentum and taking a breather. Nifty Bank, Nifty PSU Bank, Auto, and the IT indices are inside the weakening quadrant. Among these four, while IT and Auto continue to rotate southwest, Bank Nifty and PSU banks are seen sharply improving on their relative momentum. Nifty Metal and Media are inside the lagging quadrant. Though they are also seen improving on their relative momentum, they may continue to relatively underperform the broader markets. The commodities index has rolled inside the improving quadrant. Nifty Energy, Consumption, Pharma, and Realty Indices are also inside the improving quadrant and are seen firmly maintaining their relative momentum against the broader markets. Important Note: RRGTM charts show the relative strength and momentum of a group of stocks. In the above Chart, they show relative performance against Nifty500 Index (Broader Markets) and should not be used directly as buy or sell signals.

    "article_content": "Sensex extends losses to 6th day, plunges 901 pts; Nifty near 18,850 With Nifty having lost more than 1,300 points from its lifetime peak and Sensex weaker by 4,800 points amid FII sell-off, the downside has been led by Adani Enterprises , Adani Ports , IT stocks, HDFC Bank and RIL . Since September 15, when Nifty hit lifetime intra-day peak of 20,222.45 and Sensex 67,927.23, Tech Mahindra and Wipro have been the biggest losers among bluechips with a 14% loss during the period. Peer Infosys is down around 10% since then. Adani Enterprises has lost over 13%, Adani Ports 9% and RIL 9%. HDFC Bank, which recently completed a reverse merger with parent entity HDFC, is down 12%. Other top bluechip losers include Tata Steel , JSW Steel and ICICI Bank - down around 9-10% each. In the meantime, PSU stock Coal India , Nestle , Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Auto have also shown strength. \"Sectors like banking and IT which constitute the largest segments of the AUM of FPIs are likely to be under pressure. This will provide opportunities for long-term investors to buy quality stocks, particularly in banking, at attractive rates,\" said Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. Nifty's plunged to a four-month low today comes on the back of a spike in US Treasury yields to nearly 5% on a higher-for-longer interest rate outlook. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, a bedrock for pricing risk-taking across financial markets, jumped 11 basis points (bps) overnight and traded at 4.96% on Thursday. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.5%. Japan's Nikkei sank 2%, as chip-related shares led a broad selloff. Alphabet shares slid another 2% after hours and pulled Nasdaq futures down by 1.1%.

    "article_content": "Sensex halts record run, nosedives 931 pts; Nifty at 21,150 NEW DELHI: After hitting fresh record peak near the 72,000 level, Sensex on Wednesday fell over 1,100 points before ending 931 points lower at around 70,500 while Nifty also tumbled 303 points as traders chose to book profits amid concerns over high valuation and overbought signals on charts. Dalal Street has been on a winning run non-stop for the last seven consecutive weeks. The fall was sharper in Nifty Midcap and Nifty Smallcap indices - each of them tumbled over 3%. All sectoral indices ended in the red. The fall was sharper in auto, media, metal, PSU banks, and realty stocks. Adani Ports and Adani Enterprises ended with a loss of around 6% each, while Tata Steel was left 5% weaker. SBI and Tata Motors fell 3% each while RIL lost over 1% as 46 out of 50 Nifty stocks ended with a loss. Nifty Midcap 100 registered its biggest single session decline in almost a year while Nifty PSU Bank turned out to be the biggest loser with a 4% decline. While Reliance Power ended 10% lower, IRFC and IRCTC fell around 7-8%, YES Bank and Vodafone Idea also lost 6-7%. In percentage terms, today's decline in Nifty was the biggest single-day loss in last 9 months. In the last one month alone, the index has rallied over 1,400 points or about 7.2% with November turning out to be the best month for Nifty in 2023. \"Markets were on a record setting spree for a while and have been in an overbought zone, so hiccups were expected in the form of profit-taking which came to the fore today,\" said Prashanth Tapse of Mehta Equities. Chartists said it is too early to conclude the uptrend has faded until the Nifty breaks 20,700 i.e. 20 EMA on the daily scale. The rising cases of Covid sub-variant JN.1 in India is also drawing the attention of market participants. Kerala reported 292 new active cases of COVID-19 and 3 deaths yesterday. Earlier in the day, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya reviewed the preparedness of health facilities and stressed on being alert against emerging strains of coronavirus. However, the pharma index also fell over 1%. Investors are also closely tracking geo-political tension due to impact on shipping routes in the Red Sea region after recent attacks by Iran-aligned Yemeni Houthi militants. The sudden change in market mood took participants by surprise as all global and domestic cues remain positive. Japan's Nikkei 225 was trading higher by 1.5%, while London's FTSE 100 was up 1%. The US 10-year and 2-year bond yields fell over 100 bps each, while Brent crude oil prices were still trading below the $80 level. Both valuation parameters and technical indicators have been hinting at a consolidation ahead after a one-way rally seen in the last few days. A study of December month's performance in the last five years shows that positive run-ups during the lead period have had corrections or consolidations in the subsequent fortnight, while declines during the lead-up were followed by upswings especially so in the last five years. \"In the eve of last elections, the first 10 days of December saw declines helping the subsequent push higher in the next 10 days followed by consolidation in the rest of December as well as till the beginning of March,\" Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services told ETMarkets. If history repeats, we are likely to see a decline in the rest of December, followed by a consolidation period before election vibes bring in more traction. FII flow may also dry up in the holiday season. On a more fundamental level, analysts say that the market cap to GDP ratio, also known as the Buffett Indicator, has reached levels, that signal potential overvaluation as the market may have priced itself well ahead of the curve. \"Excesses in the small and microcap space raise concerns, and there is an anticipation of volatility, especially in segments where valuations appear stiff. Despite these short-term challenges, the overarching trend seems to favor India, presenting a higher growth potential relative to peer countries in the region,\" said Kenneth Andrade of Old Bridge Capital. Various market experts have been warning against a possible bubble building up in the smallcap space. PMS fund manager Siddhartha Bhaiya, who runs Aequitas Investment Consultancy, has temporarily suspended the inflow of funds into domestic PMS and AIF funds. \"This decision has been made due to our minimum margin of safety requirements before investing in stocks. We continue to remain bullish on the long-term prospects of both our country and our portfolio holdings. However, the current frenetic and euphoric rally in the small and midcap index over the last 6 months has reduced the number of stocks that fit within our valuation framework. As a result, we see a bubble building in the IPO and SME markets,\" he said. Bhaiya is known for picking smallcap multibaggers. The consensus view on Dalal Street is that largecap stocks offer better reward-risk balance given more reasonable valuations versus lofty valuations of most mid- and small-cap stocks. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} In Video: Sensex halts record run, nosedives 931 pts; Nifty at 21,150 Read More News on market crash today Sensex crash Nifty crash Nifty today Nifty Midcap Nifty Smallcap stock market crash adani ports adani enterprises geojit financial services (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "Sensex halts record run, nosedives 931 pts; Nifty at 21,150 MUMBAI - The non-stop bull run on Dalal Street came to a halt on Wednesday, as benchmark indices registered the biggest losses in a single session in over nine months after scaling record highs in early trade. From the all-time high level of 21,593 points, the Nifty 50 slumped more than 400 points or 1.4% and settled at 21,150. The Sensex plunged by over 1,400 points from its lifetime high of 71,913 to end at 70,506, a 1.3% cut. Why did markets fall today? Much of the fall in the market was due to profit-booking after the record rally amid concerns over high valuation and overbought signals on technical charts. In December alone, the Nifty 50 and Sensex have risen over 5% each. Of the 50 constituents of Nifty, 46 of them ended in the red and fell up to nearly 6%. The two top laggards were Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports and SEZ. You Might Also Like: Sensex crashes over 900 points. Early signs of a U-turn on one-way Street? Traders were also tracking rising cases of the Covid sub-variant JN.1 in India. On Wednesday, 614 cases of Covid-19 were reported across India, the highest since May 21. Geopolitical tensions also played spoilsport as impact on shipping routes in the Red Sea region dented investor sentiment. \"The domestic market saw a sharp and abrupt sell-off in the second half, despite the positive trend in global peers. This is attributable to profit booking from the recent sharp rally stretching valuations of mid- and small-cap stocks. The recent uptick in crude prices prompted investors to book profits,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. The sell-off was broad-based and more prominent in the smallcap segment, which witnessed a healthy correction after several months. You Might Also Like: Nifty bull run comes to an abrupt halt after 7 weeks. What went wrong suddenly? Snapping a 5-day winning streak, the BSE Smallcap index ended 3.4% down after scaling fresh lifetime high in early trade. The Nifty Midcap100 registered its biggest single session fall in almost a year. \"Domestic equities are witnessing sell off after a sharp run up of more than 12% in last seven weeks. We expect market to consolidate in the near term as investor resort to profit booking and access the potential risk of rising covid cases especially in Kerala and Karnataka, making them cautious in the market,\" said Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Overall, we remain positive on the market and expect recovery after a pause supported by global macros along with interest rates peaking out and healthy domestic macros, Khemka added. Hindustan Construction , SpiceJet , Man Industries , Dish TV , MTNL , Indiabulls Real Estate , and Texmaco Infrastructure are among the smallcap stocks that dropped 9-12% on Wednesday. There was selling across sectors, but power, telecom, metal, automobiles, capital goods, and real estate bore the brunt of it. The Nifty Energy index snapped a five-session gaining streak and ended nearly 3% down. The BSE Power index, which hit a lifetime high earlier in the day, slumped more than 4%. In the last month, the index has rallied more than 19%. The Nifty Metal index ended in the red for the second straight session. Vedanta , Tata Steel , NMDC , and SAIL finished over 4-6% down. Meanwhile, information technology stocks were under selling pressure following weak guidance by Accenture Plc. The Nifty IT index dropped for the second session. Stocks in the public sector also weren’t spared, with the Nifty PSE index finishing 4% lower. The banking pack also witnessed a bear attack, with public sector banks getting butchered the most. The Nifty PSU Bank index registered its biggest single-session decline in over a year. What’s in store for Thursday? While the sharp fall has turned the short-term trend negative, this correction in the market was warranted after the non-stop rally since November, according to analysts. “This is the first serious slide in the Nifty index after the seven weeks of up move and it may result in further dip,” says Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking. However, it is too early to conclude that the uptrend has faded until the Nifty breaks 20,700 levels, Mishra said. Mishra suggests accumulating quality names during this correction phase but warned that selling pressure could be higher in the midcap and smallcap space.

    "article_content": "iStock INSIGHTS Read Stock Insights by ET for a quick analysis NSE BSE Maitri Enterprises Ltd. PEER COMPANIES Explore Now NEW DELHI: Just when the stock market rally was looking bulletproof after seven consecutive weekly gains that took Sensex and Nifty to never-seen-before levels, bulls were in for a shock on Wednesday afternoon as the market plunged abruptly leading to a Rs 9 lakh crore loss in market capitalisation. Most participants were left scratching their heads to understand what went wrong suddenly when none of the major global or domestic cues were blinking red on their terminals. In one of the worst days in the market in 2023, Nifty ended 1.4% lower, while Sensex ended 931 points weaker. Mid and smallcaps were left bleeding as the Nifty Midcap100 registered its biggest single-session decline in almost a year. The PSU bank index fell 4% to record single biggest session decline in over a year. Market data showed that FIIs were net sellers to the tune of Rs 1,322 crore but DIIs made up for the loss with net buying of Rs 4,754 crore. Here are 6 factors that could be behind today's Sensex, Nifty fall: You Might Also Like: Bear attack! Nifty 50 sees biggest 1-day fall in 9 months; what should investors do 1) Profit booking Riding high on the back of consistent FII inflows, the Nifty has been rallying incessantly for the last seven weeks. November month's 5.5% upside was the highest monthly gain for the index since July 2022. After such a sharp rise in a short period, some amount of profit booking and consolidative move was warranted. A study of December month's performance in the last five years shows that positive run-ups during the lead period have had corrections or consolidations in the subsequent fortnight, while declines during the lead-up were followed by upswings especially so in the last five years. 2) Rising Covid-19 cases Not that Covid-19 has become a major public health issue once again, but the recent rise in the Covid sub-variant JN.1 cases in India has raised concerns among some investors. You Might Also Like: Sensex crashes over 900 points. Early signs of a U-turn on one-way Street? Kerala reported 292 new active cases of COVID-19 and 3 deaths yesterday. Earlier in the day, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya reviewed the preparedness of health facilities and stressed being alert against emerging strains of coronavirus. However, the pharma index also fell 1.65%. 3) Red Sea tensions Investors are tracking global trade disruption and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East following attacks on ships by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi forces in the Red Sea. On Wednesday, Greece advised commercial vessels sailing in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden to avoid Yemeni waters. Greek ship owners control about 20% of the world's commercial vessels in terms of carrying capacity. About 12% of world shipping traffic passes up the Red Sea and through the Suez Canal. Although oil supply has been re-aligned, no shortages have yet emerged, analysts said. Brent crude oil prices rose over 1% to around $80 a barrel. 4) Smallcap bubble While Kotak Equities had called the broader market rally as \"madcap rally\" way back in early September, the chorus of a bubble building in the broader market is growing louder with each passing day. \"There are hardly any margins of safety left in some pockets of mid- and small-caps after a significant run-up, thus taking out some froth is healthy for the market,\" said Sanjeev Hota, Head of Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. 5) IPO rush Unlike typical December months, this winter is a IPO-heavy one with 11 mainboard and several other SME IPOs jostling for attention in last month of 2023. Analysts say the buoyant primary market may have set the stage for a correction. \"Tight liquidity among HNIs due to their involvement in IPOs could have contributed to the selling pressure,\" said Parth Nyati, founder of Tradingo. 6) AIF factor The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had yesterday tightened the norms for banks and NBFCs from utilising the alternative investment fund (AIF) route to 'evergreen' their loans. “If an AIF scheme, in which regulated entity (bank or NBFC) is already an investor, makes a downstream investment in any such debtor company, then the regulated entity shall liquidate its investment in the scheme within 30 days from the date of such downstream investment by the AIF,” RBI had said.

    "article_content": "iStock After hitting record high levels - Sensex at 72,562 and Nifty at 21,834 - on the first trading day of the new year, bulls were seen having second thoughts on Tuesday. Sensex fell over 650 points to give up its control over Mt 72K while Nifty failed to sustain 21,700 level. Sensex ended the day 379 points weaker at 71,892 while Nifty ended at 21,665.80. Small and midcaps were relatively less affected. Nifty Bank ended 1% weaker while Nifty Auto fell 1.37% on weaker than expected December sales numbers. Nifty IT and Realty also fell over 1% each. Nifty Pharma was the top gainer in sectoral churning as it rallied around 2.5%. An important trend to watch out for is the spike in the volatility index VIX to 14.5, which indicates that high volatility is around the corner, points out VK Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services . In Monday's session, FIIs were seen reducing their future index long position holdings by 0.71% and increasing future index shorts by 2.55%. Here are key factors behind Sensex fall today: 1) Profit booking at peak levels Nifty, which hit a fresh record high of 21,834.35 in Monday's session, saw a sell-off in the last 30 minutes of yesterday's trading session, signifying the market can be vulnerable at peaks due to profit booking. 2) Valuation worries While the valuations of Sensex and Nifty are not yet in the danger zone, investors have been raising concerns about the possibility of euphoria building up in pockets of the market, particularly in smaller stocks. Kotak Institutional Equities sees a modest upside of just 1% for Nifty by December 2024. \"As per our ‘Nifty fair value’ model, the index is now close to 20% overvalued. Thus, we do not anticipate a large upside to the index from this point. The most likely outcome for the index in the next 6-9 month period seems to be a time correction,\" the brokerage said. 3) Derivative factor Whenever there is a decrease in the FII long short ratio supported by PCR bearish divergence, Nifty tends to correct. \"The first time this happened was on July 19 and 20 when Nifty made a top of 19,992 and corrected 3.85%. The second time it happened was on September 14 and Nifty made a top of 20,222 on September 15 and corrected 6.84%. Nifty has given the same signal again on January 1,\" SAMCO Securities said. 4) Auto effect December month sales data shows that auto OEMs’ volumes grew on a YoY basis across segments, barring CVs and tractors, with the 2W segment leading the growth, while PV volume displayed moderate growth. With the numbers turning out to be below expectations, the Nifty Auto index fell 1.4% with Eicher Motors and Ashok Leyland leading the fall with a loss of around 3% each. 5) Red Sea worries Investors were closely tracking tensions in the Middle east after Iran dispatched a warship to the Red Sea as the US Navy destroyed three Houthi boats. Brent crude climbed above $78 a barrel after declining by 5% over the prior three sessions, with West Texas Intermediate near $73. The US Navy said it was fired upon when responding to a distress call from a vessel in the Red Sea, resulting in the sinking of the three boats. In response, Iran’s Alborz destroyer entered the vital waterway on Monday, state media said. 6) Weak earnings outlook from IT Traders have begun to gear their portfolios towards the upcoming Q3 earnings season which begins next week with TCS and Infosys leading the show on January 11. \"During 3QFY24, we expect aggregate revenue growth for our coverage universe to remain muted at 0.8% QoQcc, given the seasonal impact of furloughs, which are deeper this year,\" Jefferies said, adding that Accenture's recent results do not indicate a recovery on the ground for IT firms and that Nifty IT's 31% premium to Nifty looks rich. The IT index fell over 1%. 7) January effect In the last 12 years, Nifty 50 has given negative returns in 7 instances in January. In fact, it has given negative returns for 5 years in a row between 2019 and 2023.

    "article_content": "Agencies While there is no inherent fundamental reason as to why the stock market will behave in a particular fashion during a leap year, the seasonality effect is too strong to ignore as we enter 2024. Loaded with an extra day, leap years have a history of depressing Sensex , Nifty investors with big crashes as was noticed in 1992, 2000, 2008 and then again in the Covid lows of 2020. A study of market performance since 1984 shows that the average annual returns in all the 10 leap years has been less than 8%. On the other hand, the return in non-leap years has been much higher at 23%. !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}(); The stock market's feud with leap years started from 1992 when the Harshad Mehta scam shook investor's faith. On 29th April 1992, Sensex dropped 12.77% in one of the worst market crashes in India. From the calendar year's high, the index closed 42% lower. But on an annual return basis, Sensex managed to end 37% higher. In 2000, investors lost 21% in a global meltdown due to the dot-com bubble burst in the US. The year 2008 was again a witness to one of the worst bloodbaths in the annals of Dalal Street when Sensex lost more than half of its value in the global financial crisis. 2016 also turned out to be a volatile year for investors as it was full of market-moving events like demonetisation, surgical strike and US elections. The memories of Covid-led crash in 2020 are still afresh in the memory of investors. Although the index ended 16% higher with central banks flushing the market with funds, it wasn't without taking heart-wrenching plunges. It was also the first when Sensex hit a lower circuit limit and fell 12.71% in a single day on March 23. Will 2024 be as bloody as other leap years? The stupendous rise in Nifty, which hit another record high on the first day of the new year, has left bears without a vocal cord. But investors must not forget that most positive outcomes related to rate cuts and Lok Sabha elections have already been priced in leaving very little margin for safety. While Kotak Institutional Equities expects a modest 1% rise in Nifty by December 2024, other brokerages have given targets going up to 23,000. The brokerage's fair value model shows the index is now close to 20% overvalued. \"Thus, we do not anticipate a large upside to the index from this point. The most likely outcome for the index in the next 6-9 month period seems to be a time correction,\" said Kotak's Anurag Singh. On the technical side, Nifty charts indicate that the buying momentum may propel the index towards the 23000 to 23500 range. Since March 2020, there are six instances of 10% decline in Nifty. Each one of them was followed by an average 25% return in subsequent rallies before a correction ensued, said Rajesh Palviya of Axis Securities. \"Following a recent 7% correction, with Nifty declining from 20222 to 18837, applying the aforementioned analysis suggests a projection for Nifty in CY24 around 23,500,\" he said. Even the study of leap years shows that there have been exceptions in 1988 and 2012. As you get ready to splurge once again on equities, do not forget what author Morgan Housel says - Risk is what you don't see.

    "article_content": "NDA vs INDIA Bloc: Stock markets bleed on results day, investors lose Rs 30L Cr Disappointed with early counting trends that showed Dalal Street ’s favourite Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA alliance may win elections but with a lower-than-expected seat count, Sensex today fell over 6,100 points to record the biggest intraday fall in the last four years. Sensex and Nifty not only erased all of the gains recorded in Monday's session as exit poll euphoria that predicted 350+ seats for NDA looked far-fetched. The total market capitalisation of all BSE-listed stocks fell by nearly Rs 21.5 lakh crore in late morning. But this may just be the beginning of a short-term downtrend in the market if NDA's seat tally turns out to be below the 300-level, analysts say. \"Following the exit poll results, the market had factored in around 350 seats for NDA and now if it falls below 300 then it would be a big disappointment for bulls ,\" said Kranthi Bathini of WealthMills Securities . Some analysts are also of the opinion that the market could be over-reacting to early trends. \"Due to physical counting under VVPAT, the process is slower this time around. I feel the market will once again get steady and high-beta stocks will be bought,\" said Dalal Street veteran investor Deven Choksey. If the market falls further, high-flying PSU stocks as well as those being labelled as \"Modi stocks\" are likely to be among the worst hit in the avalanche. Nifty PSU Bank index was the worst hit as it crashed over 11% with all stocks in the index seeing double-digit losses. Other PSU stocks like PFC, REC and BEL fell up to 20%. Dalal Street's fear gauge India VIX jumped 40% to 29.79 to record its biggest single-day gain in 9 years. The flight to safety was visible as the 10-year bond yield spiked 10 bps to 7.04%. With a 2% fall in the pre-election week, investors had baked in around 300-320 seats for NDA but exit polls set the benchmark higher only to be disappointed on Tuesday morning. However, elections may not have an impact in the long run as investors train their focus back to fundamentals, growth outlook and company earnings. In the worst case scenario, if the downtrend sustains in case NDA seat tally falls below the 300-mark, it could be the first bear market for new investors who got attracted to stocks post the Covid rally. \"New investors, especially those who entered the market after COVID-19, might not have experienced market corrections before. Since market movements are cyclical, errors during corrections can lead to substantial losses for inexperienced investors. Therefore, thorough research and effective risk management are crucial before making any investment decisions. Rushed or speculative investments could result in serious financial repercussions,\" said Vinnaayak Mehta, Founder of The Infinity Group. Analysts are of the opinion that retail investors should not rush in to buy the dip in today's market and wait for the panic to settle down. \"But I do not think it is the time to short. Go long on the high beta trade - Adanis, PSUs. Just be cautious there. Try and build your portfolio on stocks which are giving you momentum like HDFC twins, SBI Life, UltraTech, ABFRL and Vodafone Idea,\" said market veteran Sanjiv Bhasin. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} (You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel ) In Video: NDA vs INDIA Bloc: Stock markets bleed on results day, investors lose Rs 30L Cr Read More News on sensex crash today Sensex NDA market elections fall counting exit poll stocks bulls (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

    "article_content": "ETMarkets.com By crashing up to 8.5% intraday on Tuesday, Nifty today suffered its biggest fall since March 2020 when the whole world was stressed about Covid-19. The headline equity index erased all gains made in the calendar year 2024 and fell below the 21,300-mark after vote counting for elections showed BJP may not win as many seats as the market had priced in. While Sensex fell up to 6,234 points during the day, Nifty bulls saw an erosion of nearly 2,000 points at day's low. On BSE , over 3,400 stocks fell with 745 hitting the lower circuit limit and 285 stocks touching 52-week low levels. The market capitalisation of all listed companies on BSE declined by Rs 45.56 lakh crore to Rs 380.35 lakh crore during the day. Exit poll predictions had unleashed the bulls on Dalal Street on Monday with predictions that the ruling NDA may win over 350 seats in the elections. However, counting trends show that the NDA is leading in around 300 seats while the opposition INDIA has bagged more than 200 seats. \"The market, which had begun to price in a landslide victory for the NDA, is witnessing a significant correction due to margin calls, as retail investors were carrying heavily leveraged positions. Support seems to be very fragile. Immediate support is visible at the psychological level of 22,000, below which the index might fall further towards 21,400-21,500,\" said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities . Buy the dip mantra may work as recovery looks possible once the trend moves in favor of the BJP winning the election comfortably. However, a bigger fall could be in the offing if NDA's seat tally fails to cross the 300-mark. A hung parliament could even kick off the beginning of a bear market before investors shift focus back to economic growth and earnings. \"If the election verdict is not to the market's liking, you will expect a meaningful correction in the near term. That is very simple. And when that happens, almost everything will fall. But if you think longer term of 2-5 years, banks should still do quite well,\" said top fund manager Prashant Jain. Historical data shows that largecap forward-looking returns improve significantly over time. \"In the last 6 months, the average forward return (for Sensex) is 8.3% with a 73.2% winning chance. Over 1 year, returns increase to 15.8% with a 73.8% chance. At 2 years, returns jump to 30.7% with an 81.8% chance. By 3 years, the return is 44.2% with a 95.1% chance, and over 4 years, it reaches 55.9% with a 96.3% chance. This data highlights the benefits of patience and a long-term perspective in the market,\" said Quantace Research smallcase manager Karthick Jonagadla. A large part of the selling is believed to be led by FIIs who have played cautiously ahead of the D-Day. \"Mutual funds are sitting on enough cash and that money should also get deployed. So, barring the today's reaction, I am not really worried about the market's trend changing at this point of time,\" said Ravi Dharamshi of ValueQuest Investment Advisors. While long-term bulls are finding value in bluechips and other largecaps, the market may not be as kind to high flying small and midcaps. \"We expect 7-10% downside for broader markets from current levels. We recommend positioning to move from alpha stocks to defensives,\" Jaykrishna Gandhi of Emkay Global. He suggests adding FMCG, IT, pharma and shorting ABB, Siemens, Cummins, Coal India, NTPC, PFC, REC, PNB and Canara Bank. Investor preference for defensive was clearly visible in the market as HUL, Dabur, Colgate-Palmolive and D-Mart rallied 4-6% each. On the other hand, Nifty bluechips like Adani Ports, Adani Enterprises, SBI, ONGC, NTPC, Coal India, L&T and BPCL fell in double-digits. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} (You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel ) Read More News on market crash today Nifty crash market fall Covid days investors Sensex elections BSE market capitalisation (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2024 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

In the first phase of its launch, Pidge emerged as a key player in providing consistent delivery experience by handling more than 5 million orders. To spur the MSME industry, Pidge wants to allocate power in the hands of brands through its SaaS platform that can onboard any delivery business. In the first phase of its launch, Pidge emerged as a key player in providing a safe, secure, and consistent delivery experience by handling more than 5 million orders. Logistics technology provider Pidge, which aims to bring about digital parity in a largely unorganised logistics sector, has launched its services in all mega and metro cities pan India. Following a successful stint in the delivery logistics model, Pidge is now set to redefine the landscape of logistics across India with its industry-first low-code and self-serve logistics SaaS (software-as-a-service) technology platform. This expansion will allow Pidge to enable 60 million MSMEs to unlock their growth potential. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} In the first phase of its launch, Pidge emerged as a key player in providing a safe, secure, and consistent delivery experience by handling more than 5 million orders for a diversified set of clients ranging from bakeries and cloud kitchens to food subscription companies to many other D2C and e-commerce brands. On Pidge’s expansion, Ratnesh Verma , Founder and CEO, Pidge, said, “Pidge is not just a logistics solution; it is a catalyst for growth and success. We are committed to empowering MSMEs in India by providing them with the easiest access to leading technology. Our mission is to digitally enable the largely unorganised courier partners while empowering businesses to build hybrid networks.” Pidge has a burgeoning market to capture. India’s logistics sector, driven by increasing e-commerce, is experiencing exponential growth. It has grown to around $100 billion in 2020, up from around $40 billion in 2010 and from around $15 billion in 2000. By 2025, the size of the Indian logistics market is projected to reach about $380 billion. The Indian 3PL (third-party logistics) market is expected to register a growth rate of over 11.5% during 2020–2025. To spur the MSME industry, Pidge wants to allocate power in the hands of brands through its seamless SaaS platform that can onboard any delivery business and allow them to launch their operations with full delivery capacity. By leveraging Pidge’s platforms, brands can easily optimise their delivery options, eliminate the problem of unfulfilled demands, minimise delivery costs and enhance customer experience. Pidge’s platform is able to seamlessly integrate with both major and regional supply networks, providing AI-driven route optimization, advanced geocoding capabilities, real-time tracking, customizable alerts, and other communication to ensure reliable and on-time deliveries. Pidge’s interoperable platform allows businesses the freedom to move freely between self-fulfilment and 3PL partners. MSMEs can vastly improve their revenue through Pidge’s low-code, unified dashboard for multi-channel demand generation, combined with game-changing offerings for subscription-led businesses. Advanced analytics, AI-based proprietary technology and custom algorithms will make an unprecedented combination of speed and reach to enable faster commerce. Once Pidge helps MSMEs with its self-serve logistics, its next aim will be to integrate with smaller delivery partners so as to make them capable of fulfilling their demands. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on MSME Logistics india ratnesh verma pidge saas (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

A recent LinkedIn report highlighted that 90% of small businesses in India are using artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to stay resilient in the face of uncertainty and challenges. Technology adoption has increased among all kinds of businesses since the pandemic. Further, in the era of social commerce, the new-age, tech-savvy small businesses in India are not shying away from taking the help of emerging technologies like AI and automation for various purposes, including marketing . #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Mayank Jain, co-founder of Gurugram-based Scalenut, which helps companies automate their search engine optimisation (SEO) workflow, says a lot of small and medium businesses struggle with content for their platforms and websites and look for freelancers or agencies. “But AI platforms like Scalenut help to automate the entire content strategy and workflow. AI can help you with the right keywords and show you what similar small businesses or your competition is doing,” he says. Scalenut, which has clients from all over the world, has 20% of its user base in India, out of which 80% are small businesses. The LinkedIn report also mentioned that four in 10 SMBs are implementing new creative solutions or technology in marketing. Himanshu Gupta, Co-founder & CEO of QuickReply.ai, a WhatsApp marketing automation platform, says that since the pandemic, there has been an increasing trend among small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) using AI and automation for marketing. “AI technology has become more accessible and affordable, enabling SMBs to automate tasks, gain insights from data, personalise campaigns and enhance customer experience. These technologies help SMBs streamline operations, reduce costs, and make data-driven decisions,” he adds. ET Online Register for Regional Summits and the Virtual Conclave of ETRIse World MSME Day 2023. QuickReply.ai helps D2C brands and online stores with hyper-personalised customer engagement via WhatsApp. It tracks buyers’ interaction with a brand across a range of touch points and uses this data to create unique customer personas. For example, if a buyer is looking for a floral-print top on an apparel site but bought nothing, QuickReply.ai will initiate a WhatsApp conversation to understand the reasons she did not purchase the top, and try to convince her to make the purchase. Gurugram-based HR Tech firm Culturro started working with Scalenut in February 2022 through a reference and has been using its services, Cruise Mode and Keyword Planner. Ashish Manchanda, Co-founder, Culturro, says Cruise Mode has helped them with content creation because it can streamline the process while ensuring quality and focus on SEO optimisation. “On the other hand, the Keyword Planner feature allows us to conduct comprehensive keyword research and analysis. It also helps us to do a competitive analysis for the keywords we are targeting. I think AI gives small businesses an edge to compete with funded or bigger companies with a lot of resources. We are competing with some well-established content brands, such as HBR. AI tools can help small companies like ours scale up their efforts across the entire content spectrum,” he says. Gupta of QuickReply.ai says that SMBs can achieve significant reach by using AI and automation in their marketing efforts. Apart from content generation and personalised marketing, it can also help small businesses with social media management — scheduling and publishing posts across multiple platforms, engaging with followers, and analyzing social media performance. “AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can handle customer inquiries and provide support 24/7. They can respond to common queries, provide product recommendations, and assist with purchase decisions. Also, targeted advertising. AI can optimise ad targeting based on user data and behavior, allowing SMBs to reach their desired audience with precision. A 10-member team leveraging AI is as productive as a 100-member team not using AI,” he says. Talking about how easy and early can these technologies help in getting results, Jain of Scalenut says that it can be as early as two weeks to one year. He explains it will depend how much you have already done and what your competition has done. “If you are in a very new space, when there is not so much competition, you can start ranking quickly. But if you are in a very old industry, it will take some time since there are a lot of leaders in that space.” He says it is now more important than ever that small businesses start focusing on SEO because the top positions on Google will only become more important for marketing and engagement. “Let's see if X percent of people have adopted AI today. In one year or two, this number is going to be a hundred percent. Everybody will adopt AI. The amount of content that is being published on the net is increasing heavily pretty much daily,” he adds. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} ( Originally published on Jun 19, 2023 ) Read More News on small business Artificial intelligence automation scalenut marketing (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "iStock Intel Corp. has made announcements about more than $50 billion in new plants in Poland, Germany and Israel. The global race to build domestic factories and sever dependency on overseas suppliers for these critical components is spurring a spending boom, and the biggest beneficiaries so far are arguably the chipmakers. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Just in the last week, Intel Corp. has made announcements about more than $50 billion in new plants in Poland, Germany and Israel, spurred on by government incentives. Combined, the US, the European Union, Japan and India have committed more than $100 billion in subsidies to attract the likes of Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Micron Technology Inc. For chipmakers, the subsidies represent an important hedge against rising costs while they work to reshape the global manufacturing landscape. For the governments, the plants mean jobs, investment in infrastructure and supply-chain security for the semiconductors needed for everything from automotive production and mobile phones to home appliances. Confronted with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s perennial threat to take over Taiwan by force, they’re betting that more plants in more countries insulates them against disruptions. Intel’s biggest layout in Europe will be its €30 billion ($32.8 billion) plant in Germany, where it negotiated a subsidy package valued at about €10 billion. Intel said its new site in Magdeburg is expected to create 7,000 construction jobs during the initial construction phase, as well as around 3,000 permanent high-tech jobs and tens of thousands of additional positions “across the industry ecosystem.” The German government and Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker originally agreed to subsidies worth €6.8 billion. But the company was able to argue that the cost to build the plant, originally estimated at €17 billion, had ballooned because of technological advances, inflation and higher energy costs. Germany agreed to add another €3 billion in state aid in a package that includes price caps. STMicroelectronics NV and GlobalFoundries Inc. have gotten about 40% of their costs subsidized via the European Union’s Chips Act, people familiar with the matter have said. TSMC, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, is in long-running talks with the German government for as much as 50% of its new semiconductor plant in Dresden, on par with what Japan offered the company. The company and its partners may spend as much as €10 billion to build the facility. TSMC executives have repeatedly talked about higher operating costs with its ongoing diversification push, and in the most recent annual shareholder meeting, Chairman Mark Liu said the company may face challenges on human resource and labor unions in Germany. Still, governments that sink too much into these subsidies risk a backlash from taxpayers still grappling with soaring inflation and rising interest rates. Even TSMC founder Morris Chang has warned that efforts by governments around the world to build domestic chip supply chains could push up costs and yet still fail to achieve self-sufficiency. When German chipmaker Infineon Technologies AG got €1 billion for its plant in Dresden, Clemens Fuest, the head of Germany’s IFO economic institute, warned that the trade-off of subsidies for homegrown chip production might not make sense. “My concern is that we are handing out a huge amount of money only to slightly increase security of the supply,” Fuest told German broadcaster ARD in May. “Even if it all works out, we will still be importing 80% of our chips.” #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Semiconductor Subsidy Hedge Supply chips semiconductors (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

In a grey, squat building overlooking the Thames River in London, high-level talks began Monday on how to clean up an industry that carries more than 80% of world trade — and spews more carbon dioxide into the Earth’s atmosphere each year than Germany. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Shipping ’s climate impact rarely gets the same attention as planes or cars. But it’s still a major polluter, responsible for almost 3% of manmade CO2 emissions . Seaborne trade is expected to get even bigger between now and 2050, making the industry’s energy transition — or lack of — all the more important. Run by the London-based International Maritime Organisation , the global regulator, this week’s talks are part of a long and slow-moving series of international meetings about what green goals the industry should aim for, and how it might get there. By the end of this week there should be a major new target, though exactly how that’s phrased is yet to be decided. A draft document seen by Bloomberg News on Friday had the industry agreeing to try and reach net zero “around” 2050. That’s because aligning with the Paris Agreement ’s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels isn’t just about when shipping needs to hit zero, it’s also about the emissions it racks up along the way. Last week’s draft did include “indicative checkpoints” for 2030 and 2040, but they fell short of similar proposals from the US, UK and Canada, as well as European Union nations. That said, any kind of net zero by 2050 goal would be a step forward: international shipping’s current emissions cutting goal is only 50% by then, well short of aligning with the Paris treaty. In the end, a target is only a target. It’s not, in itself, binding. If the industry is to actually cut back on its carbon emissions, it ultimately needs to burn less of the oil-derived fuels it relies on today. There’re lots of ways forward, the most obvious being using low or zero carbon alternatives, like green methanol. But it’s not all about new fuels: ships can also be designed more efficiently, use wind to help them move through the water, or even capture their CO2 onboard. Transition at this scale is far from easy. The industry uses hundreds of millions of tons of fuel each year. Producing that much replacement product — or, in fact, potentially a lot more given oil’s relatively high energy density — is a massive challenge. It also has to be made available pretty much everywhere in the world. And ships have to be able to run on them. One potential way to drive that kind of change is enforcing some kind of charge, or “levy,” on emissions. More than 20 countries backed the basic idea last month at a global finance summit in Paris — although China and the US, the world’s two largest economies, were notably absent from the list of supporters. Other nations have also previously supported the concept, as has commodity trading titan Trafigura Group, as well as the International Chamber of Shipping, a trade association which represents more than 80% of the merchant fleet. “It looks like IMO is about to adopt some very ambitious GHG reduction targets,” said Simon Bennett, deputy secretary general at ICS. “But it’s not yet certain that governments also have the appetite to rapidly develop the radical measures, such as the levy-based Fund and Reward system proposed by shipowners, that will be necessary to make such high levels of ambition plausible.” Another potential approach is to start limiting the amount of greenhouse gas emissions relative to energy used on ships. EU countries have submitted documents to the IMO proposing such a measure, arguing it would give the predictability shipping companies and fuel suppliers need to invest in decarbonisation. These ideas are very much on the IMO’s table. And while no final decisions are expected at this week’s meeting, eventually the organisation must take action — or risk becoming irrelevant as others move forward. Large shipping companies are already making moves. A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S has ordered 25 vessels that are able to run on green methanol. Rival container shipper CMA CGM is expecting 24 bio-methanol-powered, e-methanol ready vessels to be delivered by 2027. Last year, for the first time, the majority of ships ordered (by gross tonnage) were capable of running on alternative fuel — including liquefied natural gas. The EU has also already come up with its own rules: shipping will be included in its emissions trading scheme from next year and it’s also developed the FuelEU Maritime regulation, which requires greenhouse gas reductions relative to energy use. If other authorities follow the EU’s lead and create their own requirements, shipping could face a patchwork of varying regulations around the world, a potential nightmare for such a globalized industry. That highlights the central contradiction at the heart of this week’s IMO talks. As the global regulator, it alone can create sweeping, universal rules for cleaning up shipping’s emissions. But with so many member states — and conflicting interests — agreeing on those rules is also the major challenge. Still, the organisation’s Secretary-General Kitack Lim made clear last week that the time has come to find a solution. “2023 is IMO’s year of decisive climate action,” he said. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on international maritime organisation shipping emissions paris agreement carbon dioxide (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

It added that India and the Philippines will need to upskill and reskill their workforces and invest in the development of their domestic services sectors -- particularly in terms of R&D to keep pace with rapidly changing technology and still remain competitive and progress up the value chain. \"India has become a popular destination for medical travel, and hosted around 3.5 million foreign patients from 2009 to 2019,\" the report said. Foreign patients from developed countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as from developing countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, go to India in search of less costly, high-quality treatment, according to the report. Noting that services value-added accounted for over 51 per cent of India's total exports in 2018, the two organisations said that India's experience highlights how reforms to facilitate foreign direct investment (FDI) in services can \"ignite positive growth dynamics by boosting participation in foreign manufacturing value chains\". \"Fuelled by advances in information and communications technologies (ICT), global commercial services exports almost tripled between 2005 and 2022, a period that saw marked changes in the composition of services trade, with exports of digitally delivered services increasing almost four-fold,\" they said. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on India global exports news world trade organisation services export world bank china india (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "AFP Yellen shakes hands with Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, in Hanoi. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen ’s push to elevate economic ties with Vietnam , on display with a high-profile trip this week, is drawing fire for seeking to strengthen US supply chains by replacing one repressive country with another. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Yellen, who in December wrote, “We must shift away from supply chains that violate core human rights” — a reference to documented abuses in China — is meeting Vietnam’s prime minister, finance minister, central bank governor and chair of its national assembly on a three-day visit to Hanoi. The trip highlights what Yellen on Friday described as Vietnam’s “trusted-partner” status in building “secure and reliable supply chains.” Critics find it hard to square Yellen’s rhetoric with an authoritarian Vietnamese regime that jails political opponents and maintains single-party rule. It’s also unclear the extent to which raising Vietnam’s role is truly diversifying US supply lines, with Chinese companies setting up operations and providing key inputs to non-Chinese production facilities there. “It’s absolutely shocking that the Biden administration thinks it can encourage investment and business in Vietnam without supporting Hanoi’s horrible human rights record,” said Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia division at Human Rights Watch. Robertson’s group, an international watchdog, listed a litany of offenses in its 2022 annual report on Vietnam, including details on its imprisonment of rights and climate-change activists. Yellen says she won’t shy away from bringing up Vietnam’s record. Yellen’s Plans In an interview as she prepared to fly to Hanoi Tuesday, Yellen said, “I don’t think we can just look the other way.” “It’s important to raise this issue,” she said. “There is a State Department regular dialogue on human rights, and I would expect to raise it in the meeting that I have, probably, with the prime minister.” Yellen did raise the human rights situation in Vietnam during her meeting with Finance Minister Ho Duc Phoc Friday, according to a Treasury official who spoke on condition of anonymity on the matter. The official offered no such confirmation on her meeting with Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. Vietnam’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn’t respond to a request for comment on criticism of its human-rights record. Yellen has been a champion in President Joe Biden’s cabinet of “friend-shoring,” an effort to reduce the vulnerability of US supply lines to potential coercion from China. She flew to Vietnam from India, another big friend-shoring prospect — though a democratic one. Vietnam’s Allure Its politics aside, Vietnam presents an alluring investment target. China’s rapid development has increased its labor costs, leaving them more than double that of its southern neighbour. Machine operators in Vietnam cost as little as one-fourth that of those in China, according to 2022 data compiled by the Reshoring Institute, a nonprofit consulting service. Samsung Electronics, Nike Inc. and a host of Apple Inc. suppliers, including Foxconn Technology Group, have flocked to the nation. US imports from Vietnam nearly tripled, to $127 billion, in 2022 from four years before — a period in which shipments from China slightly fell, to $536 billion. Geopolitics is also a key dynamic. Vietnam has its own contentious relationship with China, with the two having overlapping claims on swaths of the South China Sea. Many Americans may still think of Vietnam as the place where more than 58,000 of their servicemen perished in a wasteful Cold War conflict that saw as many as 3 million Vietnamese killed. But Vietnam for years has been welcoming the US and its people. The port city of Danang hosted a visit by the USS Ronald Reagan, a giant aircraft carrier, in June, not long after several Chinese military vessels spent weeks operating within Vietnamese waters, prompting protests from Hanoi. “Having friends, especially friends in the region that have similar interests and similar concerns about Chinese hegemony, is always a positive,” said Edmund Malesky, a Vietnam specialist and director of Duke University’s Center for International Development. “Vietnam is going to be a leader in the region.” But it’s also a region where it’s hard to escape China’s influence. Although data from Vietnam is patchy, many exporters based in the country are Chinese-owned firms that can get around higher US tariffs by producing and shipping out of their neighbour. “You’ve got this funny situation where the US places these big tariffs on China, Chinese exports of those goods to the US fall and US imports from Vietnam rise,” said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “Some of those are literally factories being rolled over the border.” And whether Chinese-owned or not, many Vietnamese operations are highly dependent on components and materials coming out of China. Bloomberg “If every dollar imported from Vietnam is seen as lessening the dependence on China, that overstates things,” said Brad Setser, a former US trade official in the Biden administration who’s now at the Council on Foreign Relations. “If China really wanted — in a real economic coercion scenario — to cut off Vietnamese suppliers, they could do that.” Still, Setser argued that friend-shoring is a long game, and over time, if Vietnam follows the well-worn pattern of other manufacturing hubs, it will gradually source more components locally and become less dependent on China. Questions over Hanoi’s repressive behaviour are more difficult to analyse away. “Vietnam’s ruling Communist Party varies very little in its crackdown from the heavy-handed actions by Xi Jinping against civil society groups in China,” said Human Rights Watch’s Robertson. “The only difference being that the US considers Vietnam to be a dictatorship friendly to them.” Speaking Friday in Hanoi, Yellen said, “Let me be very clear: friend-shoring is not for an exclusive club of countries.” “It is open and inclusive of advanced economies, emerging markets, and developing countries alike,” she said in remarks to the US-ASEAN Business Council. Stephanie Segal, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, said Yellen is confronting the fact that the US has conflicting goals when it comes to wooing Vietnam. “Unfortunately, the reality is you end up having to prioritise some objectives,” she said. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Vietnam supply chain janet yellen vietnam friendshoring supply chain china (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen praised India's significance as an indispensable partner in the strategy of \"friendshoring\" to bolster supply chain resilience. “Friendshoring is an important foundation of our approach to increasing resilience of our supply chains, and we see India as an indispensable partner in that and I hope to use this trip to deepen what is already a significant relationship with respect to friendshoring that the US and India have,\" said Yellen. Yellen emphasised the importance of deepening the already substantial relationship between the United States and India in the context of friendshoring, acknowledging India's pivotal role, recognising the country as a valuable partner in achieving resilient and robust supply chains. Secretary Yellen expressed her appreciation to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and the Indian delegation for hosting the G20 ministerial meeting. She highlighted the upcoming Leaders' Summit in September as an opportunity to assess the progress made thus far and to intensify efforts in strengthening the global economy, supporting emerging and developing economies, and addressing global challenges.

    "article_content": "AP The company has pledged to wipe out or offset its contribution to the greenhouse gas emissions warming the planet by 2040. Amazon .com Inc.’s carbon emissions ticked lower for the first time since the company began reporting the figure, thanks to increased purchases of renewable electricity and a big slowdown in the retailer’s sales growth. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} The Seattle-based giant emitted 71.27 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2022, down 0.4% from the previous year, Amazon said in its annual sustainability report, published on Tuesday. The company achieved the improvement by using more solar and wind to power its operations and benefited from a decrease in emissions from construction and third-party transportation. Amazon in recent years has been the biggest corporate buyer of renewable electricity, using power purchase agreements to fund development of new solar and wind farms across the globe. Emissions related to electricity purchases fell 29% last year. The company has pledged to wipe out or offset its contribution to the greenhouse gas emissions warming the planet by 2040 and invited other companies making similar commitments to join what it calls the Climate Pledge . Emissions are up by about 40% since Amazon set the target in 2019, fuelled in part by supercharged sales during the pandemic. But Amazon says its carbon intensity, a measure of how much the company emits for every dollar of merchandise sold, is down 24% during the same period, thanks to the renewables push and the addition of about 9,000 electric vehicles to Amazon’s delivery fleet, among other factors. Slowing e-commerce growth also helped Amazon cut its carbon emissions for the first time. The company’s revenue grew by 9.4% in 2022, a record low. The sustainability report comes months after Amazon quietly backed away from the biggest interim goal it had laid out on the road to decarbonising its logistics business. Called Shipment Zero, the effort was supposed to make half of the company’s shipments carbon-free by 2030, but Amazon retracted it with a brief online statement. Some employees denounced the move during a rally in May outside company headquarters, but Amazon says the interim target “no longer made sense” given the Climate Pledge’s more expansive target. For years, Amazon lagged behind its peers in emissions reporting. But, amid pressure from employees and shareholder groups, the company has stepped up in recent years, disclosing more about its impact and empowering a sustainability team to invest in technologies aimed at curbing emissions. Critics say Amazon still undercounts its impact and cheapens its net-zero goal by excluding emissions produced by manufacturers Amazon purchases goods from directly as well as independent merchants who sell the majority of products on its retail site. In its public accounting of so-called Scope 3 emissions, the company only includes the impact of Amazon-branded products, which the company has said account for about 1% of sales. In their own Scope 3 carbon accounting, Amazon rivals Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. both estimate the impact of all the items sold from their shelves, making their carbon bills seem artificially large compared with Amazon’s. Walmart’s sales were about 22% higher than Amazon’s in 2021. But because Walmart includes a much wider set of products in its carbon accounting, the Bentonville, Arkansas, company’s Scope 3 emissions were more than twice as large as those at Amazon. Amazon has said it excludes products from its vendors to avoid double-counting of emissions tracked and reported by those manufacturers. But beginning in 2024, Amazon says it will update its supply-chain standards to require suppliers to share their carbon emissions data with the company and set their own carbon goals. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Amazon carbon news amazon carbon emissions greenhouse gases climate pledge renewable energy (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

Over two dozen Indian companies from the apparel, fabric and home textile sectors are participating in the Texworld fair being held from July 18-20. \"Expanding India-US trade basket! Pleasure to inaugurate the India Pavilion at Texworld, Apparel and Home Textile Sourcing Show, #NY. Indian textile companies have on offer a wide range of world class products, in particular climate-smart, organic, and carbon neutral options,\" Sandhu tweeted. India's participation in the Texworld fair is being anchored by the Handloom Export Promotion Council and the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL), a press release issued by the Consulate General of India in New York said. Majority of the Indian textile companies participating in the fair are from two main clusters in India – Panipat in Haryana and Karur in Tamil Nadu. There are several new-age products made of Bhagalpuri silk, bamboo, jute and 3D prints on display at the fair, the release said. After the inauguration, Sandhu interacted with Indian companies and visited their stalls at the fair. He encouraged them to increase efforts to enhance India's textile exports to the US and, in this regard, noted that the Commercial Wing at the Indian Embassy and Consulates in the US stand ready to offer all possible support. He further added that the world-class textile products from India already have a large presence in the US, but there was potential to do more, especially in areas of sustainable textiles and organic products. India's textile exports to the US in 2022-23 stood at 10.4 billion dollars, accounting for about 9-10 per cent of the US textile imports. The trade fair takes place biannually at the Javits Convention Centre in New York and is organised by Messe Frankfurt Inc, a leader in international trade fair sector. Texworld USA brings together exhibitors from around the world who showcase variety of products and services, including fabrics and material combinations to diverse colour palettes and provides a networking platform for businesses, retailers, designers, buyers and industry experts. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Texworld trade fair Texworld nyc india pavilion taranjit singh sandhu Handloom Export Promotion Council (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

Want a Loan? Get cash against your Mutual Funds in 4 hours Putin's declared goal in halting the Black Sea Grain Initiative was to win relief from Western sanctions on Russia's agricultural exports. His longer-term goal could be to erode Western resolve over Ukraine and get more concessions from the U.S. and its allies as the war grinds toward the 17-month mark. The Kremlin doubled down on terminating the grain deal by attacking Ukrainian ports and declaring wide areas of the Black Sea unsafe for shipping. But with the West showing little willingness to yield any ground, Putin's actions not only threaten global food security but also could backfire against Russia's own interests, potentially causing concern in China, straining Moscow's relations with key partner Turkey and hurting its ties with African countries. You Might Also Like: Explained: Why Russia pulled out of its grain deal with Ukraine and what that means for the global food system? Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who helped broker the grain deal with the U.N. a year ago, has pushed for its extension and said he would negotiate with Putin. Turkey's role as a top trading partner and a logistical hub for Russia's foreign trade amid Western sanctions strengthens Erdogan's hand and could allow him to squeeze concessions from Putin, whom he calls \"my dear friend.\" Turkey's trade with Russia nearly doubled last year to $68.2 billion, feeding U.S. suspicions that Moscow is using Ankara to bypass Western sanctions. Turkey says the increase is largely due to higher energy costs. Their relationship is often characterized as transactional. Despite being on opposing sides in fighting in Syria, Libya and the decades-long conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, they have cooperated in areas like energy, defense, diplomacy, tourism and trade.

Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, director of the German Marshall Fund in Ankara, said the relationship's dual nature dates back to the sultans and czars. \"Sometimes they compete, sometimes they cooperate. At other times they both compete and cooperate at the same time,\" he said. While the pendulum seems to have swung in Ankara's favor for now, Unluhisarcikli noted the Kremlin has a few levers to pull, such as canceling a deferment of gas payments or removing financial capital for the Akkuyu nuclear plant being built by Russia. Moscow also could hurt Turkey by restricting Russian tourists, who visit in greater numbers than any other nationality. offering a steady flow of cash. \"How much weaker the relationship gets depends on how Russia responds to Turkey getting closer to the West,\" he said. You Might Also Like: India supports UN's efforts in continuing Black Sea Grain Initiative: Ambassador Ruchira Kamboj Some observers in Moscow speculate that Russia agreed to extend the grain deal for two months in May to help Erdogan win reelection but was appalled to see his pro-Western shift afterward. Erdogan backed Sweden's membership in NATO earlier this month. In another snub to Moscow, Turkey allowed several Ukrainian commanders who led the defense of Mariupol last year to return home. They surrendered after a two-month Russian siege and then moved to Turkey under a deal that they stay there until the end of the war. Kerim Has, a Moscow-based expert on Turkey-Russia ties, said Erdogan had been emboldened by his reelection to pursue rapprochement with the West, appointing a \"pro-Western\" Cabinet and adopting a stance that was causing \"discomfort\" in the Kremlin. \"It's a dilemma for Putin,\" Has said. \"He supported Erdogan's candidacy but he will face a more active, pro-Western Turkey under Erdogan in the coming period.\" Moscow could try to pressure Erdogan by challenging Turkey's interests in northwestern Syria, where Ankara has backed armed opposition groups since the start of the conflict. Even though Russia has joined with Iran to shore up Syrian President Bashar Assad's government while Turkey has backed its foes, Moscow and Ankara have negotiated cease-fire deals. But Russia abruptly toughened its stand this month when it vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution backed by virtually all members to continue humanitarian aid deliveries to opposition-held areas through the Bab el-Hawa border crossing with Turkey, a key lifeline for about 4.1 million people in the impoverished enclave. Moscow warned that if its rival draft was not accepted, the crossing would be shut. The presence of 3.4 million Syrians in Turkey is a sensitive issue for Ankara. Erdogan has advocated their voluntary repatriation to parts of northern Syria under Turkish control. Dareen Khalifa, senior analyst on Syria at the International Crisis Group, says Russia's hard-line approach to the issue was an attempt to pressure Ankara. \"Turkey will be directly impacted by that if the mechanism ends,\" he said. Others were skeptical Russia could use the border crossing issue to strong-arm Ankara. \"I do not think Russia is in a position to increase its pressure on Turkey in Syria,\" Has said. Joseph Daher, a Swiss-Syrian researcher and professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, observed that Russia could be trying to pressure the West by raising the prospect of a new wave of refugees in Europe. Richard Gowan, U.N. director of the International Crisis Group, noted that along with the tougher stand on Syria, Russia's \"disruptive\" actions included support for Mali's push to expel U.N. peacekeepers. \"It looks like Russia is looking for ways to annoy the West through the U.N,\" he told The Associated Press. Reflecting Moscow's increasingly muscular stand, Russian military pilots recently have harassed U.S. aircraft over Syria in incidents that added to tensions between Moscow and Washington. The Pentagon described Russia's maneuvers as unprofessional and unsafe, while Moscow sought to turn the tables by accusing the U.S. of violating deconfliction rules intended to prevent collisions over Syria. Amid the hardball at the U.N. and in Syria, Russia has been courting African nations with promises of support. The Kremlin has emphasized it stands ready to provide poor countries in Africa with free grain after the termination of the Black Sea deal, and Putin is set to woo African leaders at a summit in St. Petersburg later this month. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow's offer of free grain shipments would be on the agenda. The Black Sea deal allowed Ukraine to ship 32.9 million metric tons of grain and other food to global markets. According to official data, 57% of the grain from Ukraine went to developing nations, while China received the most - nearly a quarter. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that 60,000 metric tons of grain destroyed by Russia's strike on the port of Odesa on Wednesday were bound for China. Putin, in turn, accused the West of using the grain deal to \"shamelessly enrich itself\" instead of its declared goal of easing hunger. Despite such rhetoric, the Russian move won't play well in African countries. Even as the Kremlin tried to contain the damage to those ties, it unleashed more attacks on Odesa and other ports to thwart Ukrainian attempts to continue grain shipments. Moscow described them as \" strikes of retribution \" for Monday's attack that damaged the Kerch Bridge linking Moscow-annexed Crimea with Russia. Hard-liners in Moscow praised Putin for halting the deal, which they have criticized as a reflection of what they described as the Kremlin's futile hope to compromise with the West. Pro-Kremlin commentator Sergei Markov lauded the retaliatory strikes and argued that the withdrawal from the deal was long overdue. \"The grain deal's extension led to a drop in the government's ratings and was fueling talk about betrayal on top,\" he said. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel ) Read More News on russia vladimir putin grain deal russia ukraine grain deal ukraine (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

Despite repeated government pledges to cut back on fossil fuel subsidies, a new report found such subsidies surged to a record $1.3 trillion last year. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} The report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) looked at both explicit and implicit subsidies for fossil fuels across 170 countries. It found explicit subsidies alone have more than doubled since the previous IMF assessment, rising from $500 billion in 2020 to $1.3 trillion in 2022 as governments rushed to mitigate the inflationary impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the spike in demand caused by the economic recovery from Covid-19. Those subsidies are direct monetary support for fossil fuels through activities like regulated prices set below international levels and energy bill rebates. IMF also calculates implicit fossil fuel subsidies, which include the cost of things such as undercharging for environmental costs and failing to levy taxes on consumption. Adding those in and the total subsidies ballooned to $7 trillion in 2022. That’s an increase of $2 trillion compared to 2020. The findings dovetail with a report that came out earlier in the week by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), a Canada-based think tank, which found that public monies in G-20 countries alone going to explicit fossil fuel subsidies more than quadrupled to $1 trillion in 2022 compared to a year ago. The two reports put into stark relief the chasm between nations’ stated goals on the urgency of cutting back on fossil fuels and their actions. In 2015, the world’s nations signed onto 17 United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals , which included a commitment to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. That commitment was made more explicit at COP26 in 2021, when 197 countries agreed to accelerate the phaseout of what the pact dubbed “inefficient subsidies.” “We are overflowing with government commitments to phase out support for fossil fuels, but there is a serious drought in implementation,” said Christopher Beaton, who researches sustainable energy consumption for IISD. “During the last two years, at the international level, we have gone backwards.” Going backwards has serious implications for the world’s efforts to hold global warming to within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels. Even at just 1.2C (2.2F) of warming, the world is experiencing devastating heat and disasters that have been worsened by climate change . This past July was the hottest month the globe has ever recorded, coming amid a summer of deadly wildfires, heat waves and floods. The climate will only become more volatile if humans keep pouring greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and continuing to subsidise fossil fuels raises that risk. “Fossil fuel subsidies keep the prices low, which increases consumption, and they are encouraging new projects that would never otherwise take place,” Beaton noted. The IMF authors said that removing explicit fuel subsidies and imposing taxes on environmental costs, including carbon dioxide and other air pollutants, would reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by 34% below 2019 levels by 2030. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on fossil fuels international monetary fund sustainable development goals ukraine russia war climate change (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "AFP Vera Songwe, Chairwoman and Founder of Liquidity and Sustainability Facility, addresses the gathering on the second day of the three-day B20 Summit in New Delhi on August 26, 2023. There is a big gap between developing and developed countries when it comes to financial inclusion . Emerging markets need to get the same access to global financial markets as the rest of the world, economist and former World Bank official Vera Songwe said on Saturday. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} “We're not getting the equity investment that is needed in the global economy because of a flight to safety,” she said, while speaking at the B20 India Summit being held in New Delhi from August 25-27. The flight to safety makes everyone leave emerging markets. “And the emerging markets are really the engine of growth,” Songwe, Chairwoman and Founder of Liquidity and Sustainability Facility, said. Interest rates in the emerging markets have been around 6% whereas it isn’t even 1% in the developing and developed markets. It is only now that the Federal Reserve has raised the US interest rates to a 22-year high to 5.5%. She also explained that one of the things that kills development in an emerging developing country is when you are forced to do a fire sale because you need financing. Fire sales refer to sales of goods at a very low price, and it usually happens during a bankruptcy. “This means that before you get into a liquidity crisis, if you don't have access very quickly to resources, to central bank or the IMF resources, then what you do is you do fire sales. You sell your best assets to be able to get liquidity and this is essentially what is keeping emerging developing countries in low-income stages. So we need to find new facilities that provide secondary capital markets to push inclusion levels of interest rates and access to markets,” she said. Further, in emerging markets, many micro, small and medium enterprises ( MSMEs ) are in the informal economy. Speaking more on this, Shinta Kamdani, CEO of Sintesa Group, said Indonesia’s informal economy is an example of this. Indonesia has 83 million people, out of which 60% of workers are in the informal economy and the government is trying to move them to the formal economy. “This is not just the story of Indonesia or Asia but there are many such countries in a similar situation,” she said, adding that the G20 presidency moving among countries that have a lot of similarities will give more focus towards financial inclusion. Indonesia has a national index created by the Economic Development Planning Ministry to measure the financial inclusivity ratio or third party accounts or bank accounts against the working population and bank credit to MSMEs. “So we are taking this very seriously. We believe that improving the financial assets to MSME and the informal sector shouldn't be seen as financial deepening,” she added. The B20 (Business20) is the G20's dialogue forum with the global business community. Established in 2010, B20 is known to be the most prominent engagement groups in G20, with companies and business organisations as participants. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on B20 summit India b20 india vera songwe financial inclusion msmes shinta kadmani (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "(L-R: Apoorva Mishra, CEO; Ankita Asai, CPO; Nikhil Gupta- COO, Dusminute) BANGALORE: Hyperlocal grocery-store and managed services company Dusminute has raised Rs 11.5 crore in a bridge round led by Inflection Point Ventures. The funds will be utilized to drive Dusminute’s growth in Bangalore. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} The round has seen participation from multiple existing investors and industry veteran angel investors syndicated by an angel investor and banker Bandana Kankani. Dusminute is building a brand catering to the grocery needs of affluent and elite residents in gated communities. While existing quick commerce and traditional e-commerce players have their limitations, such as product quality, delivery time issues and unit economics, Dusminute aims to fill this gap as a crucial third layer. With its hyperlocal omnichannel platform, Dusminute provides a convenient and timely solution for daily essentials and groceries specifically tailored to the needs of these communities. Dusminute was founded by Apoorva Mishra , Ankita Asai , and Nikhil Gupta , who bring with them a strong academic background with B. Tech degrees from prestigious institutions like IIT Kanpur and IIT Delhi. Apoorva Mishra, CEO, Dusminute is an expert in key operation areas like finance, business operations and strategy, honed through his experience as the founder of Gapoon and previous roles at EXL and Fractal. Ankita Asai, the CPO, specializes in product development, processes and growth, having also founded Gapoon and worked at Schlumberger. Nikhil Gupta, the COO, focuses on efficient operations, with prior entrepreneurial experience at Gapoon and a background at Fractal. Madhukar Bhardwaj, Sr. Vice President, Inflection Point Ventures, said in a statement, “DusMinute is aiming to take quick commerce a notch higher by leveraging an omni channel approach. It blends the best of both worlds, of a quick-commerce operator as a quick delivery provider and the convenience and healthy unit economics of a neighbourhood kirana store. In-society stores make customers more comfortable in buying and exchanging products and the home delivery provided adds convenience with a familiar touch of kirana stores. We believe such a hybrid model has the potential to emerge as a good alternative to users and will establish itself as a recognizable brand in coming times.” Dusminute plans to expand its operations to the top 7-8 cities in India, leveraging its successful foundation and meeting the growing demand for convenient grocery solutions within apartment complexes. Its niche focus on apartment complexes and its innovative omni-channel model combining a superstore and superapp sets it apart, offering convenience, high-quality products, and addressing concerns of product quality and delivery time. With a low CAC and a captive audience, Dusminute's profitable business model positions it as a leading player in serving the grocery needs of affluent residents. Apoorva Mishra, CEO, Dusminute says, “Omni channel is the future of retail and it's here already. Dusminute redefines both the offline and online experience for its consumers. This investment will help us to scale up in Bangalore and turn operationally profitable within the coming months. We want to capture a key market like Bangalore, build a profitable business and then enter newer markets in India.” Dusminute has achieved remarkable success as Karnataka's leading convenience store chain exclusively serving apartment complexes. With operations currently running in 35 apartment communities and a pipeline of a dozen more, Dusminute has solidified its position as the go-to destination for convenient shopping within these communities. Dusminute stands to benefit from substantial growth potential as the number of residents in gated communities is projected to more than double by 2030. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Dusminute fund raise dusminute apoorva mishra startup grocery ankita asai nikhil gupta (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "Getty Images Nearly 8 in 10 SME decision makers say that digitalisation is imperative for their company’s growth. The pandemic has accelerated the process of digital adoption for SMEs with 40% of respondents in a new study stating they have started their digitalisation process in the last 1-3 years. The survey goes on to add that 88% of companies started their digitalisation efforts within the last 5 years. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} According to “Digitalisation of Indian SMEs survey,” conducted by Capterra India , the transformation in the SME sector is driven by the shifting landscape of the new digital economy, the vast influence of technology, and the ever-increasing influence of SaaS on businesses . The study was conducted with a total of 435 respondents (including group of managers, senior managers, or CEOs/founders) out of which 341 work for SMEs, and 94 work for enterprises — companies having more than 250 employees. These respondents, hereon known as decision makers, belong to companies that have a digitalisation strategy in place or have implemented one in the past, thus providing a relevant, comprehensive and wide-ranging insight into the concept of digitalisation for small and medium businesses. Commenting on the survey, Sukanya Awasthi, Content Analyst for Capterra India and Digitalisation of Indian SMEs survey, said in a statement: “The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a shift in consumer sentiment and behaviour across the world.

    "article_content": "The industry body also highlighted its initiatives towards environmental sustainability via their transformative initiative - \"One Earth.\" MUMBAI: The Gem & Jewellery Exports Promotion Council (GJEPC) is anticipating business worth Rs 60,000 crore to be generated at India International Jewellery Show (IIJS) Premier 2023 and Rs 1 lakh crore for all three IIJS shows in 2023. “IIJS symbolises the underlying strength of the Indian gem and jewellery industry. The buzzing aisles on day one of IIJS Premiere 2023 is an indication of the enthusiasm and interest among exhibitors and visitors alike,\" Vipul Shah, Chairman, Gem & Jewellery Exports Promotion Council (GJEPC) on Thursday stated at IIJS Premiere 2023, a five-day B2B gems and jewellery exhibition organised by the GJEPC in Mumbai. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Delving on how the new commerce policy will boost retail exports and foreign trade agreements (FTAs) will facilitate international trade, Shah added that a host of steps have been taken to boost exports. The gem and jewellery industry has consistently shown resilience even in the face of several challenges, he said. “At present, the global geopolitical situation has affected exports. GJEPC is proactively taking measures to mitigate the impact by venturing into new markets. GJEPC conducted visits to study the potential for further penetration in existing markets and is exploring opportunities in new markets such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka,” Shah stated while delivering his inaugural address. The sector has been facing a dent in demand in the midst of global headwinds playing up. While the export target for gems and jewellery was $42 billion in the current financial year, the GJEPC anticipates a 10-15% decline in exports since the first quarter number itself was down by around 18%, Shah had told ET Digital earlier. The IIJS this year claims to become the second-largest gem and jewellery exhibition in the world. It is being organised at two venues, with over 1,850 exhibitors and 3,250 stalls. The six-day event across two venues — which serves as a platform for Indian gem and jewellery businesses to showcase their offerings to international buyers — has attracted visitors from over 65 countries. Talking about the scale of the diamond industry, Sanjay Mukherjee, Metropolitan Commissioner, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), stated that India is in a league of its own. “This expo is expected to do business of over Rs 50,000 crore. It is a revelation to many that we have moved ahead in this way in the diamond trade. Earlier, we used to read about Belgium and Antwerp, and here we are in Mumbai with such a large diamond industry,” he said. Speaking on India’s strength as a leading diamond nation, Paul Rowley, Executive Vice-President, De Beers, said the future looks bright for the country. “India is the world's top market and also one of the fastest growing major markets this year. It has excellent prospects for further growth in the long-and short-term,” he stated. The industry body also highlighted its environmental sustainability initiatives via One Earth. “We have not only surpassed our target of planting 1 lakh trees but also made an impact on the environment and on countless lives,” Shah said.

    "article_content": "Merchandise trade deficit narrows in April-June 2023-24, said RBI Governor. Merchandise trade deficit has narrowed in Q1 of 2023-24 with contraction in imports exceeding contraction in exports, Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) Governor Shaktikanta Das said during the third bi-monthly monetary policy for FY24 on Thursday. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} “Services exports and remittances are, however, expected to provide cushion to the current account deficit. We, therefore, expect CAD to remain eminently manageable during the current financial year also,” he said. “Merchandise exports and non-oil, non gold imports contracted further in June and the growth in services exports decelerated amid slowing external demand.” India's merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $20.13 billion in June, compared with $22.1 billion in May. The trade deficit contracted slightly as the decline in imports was more than the fall in exports. Merchandise exports stood at $32.97 billion, while imports were $53.10 billion in June. Merchandise exports were $42.28 billion in June 2022. In the previous month, merchandise exports were $34.98 billion, while imports stood at $57.10 billion. On the other hand, the estimated value of services export for June 2023 was $27.12 billion, as compared to $26.92 billion in June 2022. India’s overall exports (merchandise and services combined) in June 2023 is estimated to be $60.09 billion, which is -13.16% over June 2022, according to PIB release in July. Overall imports in June 2023 is estimated to be $68.98 billion, which is -13.91 % over June 2022. India’s overall exports (merchandise and services combined) in April-June 2023 is estimated to fall 7.29 per cent over April-June 2022. Overall imports in April-June 2023 is estimated to decline 10.18 per cent over April-June 2022, according to the report. “The slowdown in the world economy and tepid demand in major advanced markets have significantly impacted the engineering exports sector, which has reflected in a sharp decline in shipments. Engineering exports from India conceded year-on-year decline for the seventh month in a row in June this year starting from December 2022. While the exporters are exploring new markets, the fiscal and monetary support remain crucial for the sector, which is key to generating jobs and earning forex,” said EEPC India Chairman Arun Kumar Garodia. Meanwhile, the RBI in its monetary policy committee meeting unanimously decided to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.5%. RBI generally conducts six bi-monthly meetings in a financial year, where it decides interest rates, money supply, inflation outlook, and various macroeconomic indicators. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on RBI MPC Meet RBI SHAKTIKANTA DAS RBI MONETARY POLICY RATE HIKE INFLATION rbi governor d subbarao (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "ET Online The 18th Sustainability Summit was held on August 22-23 in New Delhi. It goes without saying that mobility is one of the largest sectors contributing towards carbon emissions and, therefore, was one of the first industries to look at for mitigating climate change. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Electric mobility is no longer a future but the present. When we talk about electric mobility, what comes to mind is the framework that has been made successful in countries like China, Europe and the US, said Brajesh Chibber , Partner, McKinsey & Company. India need not apply this and can leapfrog in a very different dimension, because our vehicle construct is very different, made up majorly of two- and three-wheelers, he said while speaking at the 18th Sustainability Summit by CII here. The event was held on August 22-23 and Chibber addressed the gathering during a panel discussion on “Emerging Technologies for Sustainability”. He said the country’s commercial vehicles were dominated by light commercial vehicles, small commercial reference payloads or low average speeds or low torque requirements. These are different from those used in other countries. “Our power requirements are very different. And these use cases, if we start to think from a standpoint or a frame of what we have in developed markets, we will start to overreach and we will start to put what probably is not fully optimal for a market like India. Therefore, we should create solutions best suited for emerging markets,” he said. India has the largest population of two-wheelers and three-wheelers on this planet and it sells the largest number of vehicles every year, Chibber said. “Our OEMs here are best placed to engineer solutions which are best suited for applications like this. A battery technology that can charge in 10 minutes and give 400 km — application of that in India is very little. We have to figure out more cost-efficient batteries, battery technology or battery chemistry, which is more akin to less (use) of rare-earth metals and developed using more abundantly available raw materials,” he said. The partner at McKinsey said India can also leapfrog in partnerships with countries that have similar transportation uses, where such applications will be of great demand. It can look at South-South collaborations on building such technology, on sourcing these raw materials. Speaking on the use of hydrogen in transport industry, he acknowledged that eventually, battery technology probably would not be the way to go for zero-emission vehicles, and hydrogen could potentially come in, along with other technologies like fuel cells used in developed markets. “But again, our use case in India is that we don't have 40 tons of goods being hauled by a single truck. We don't have trucks which will pile up 500 km a day. So maybe fuel cell technology is a bit of an overstretch for a market like India. Can we think of hydrogen-powered internal combustion engines, which is something that is being experimented and India can build the technology for emerging markets,” he added. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on India Electric mobility brajesh chibber electric vehicles mckinsey & company electric battery green hydrogen (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "iStock The move reportedly came amid an anticipation of a price rise ahead of the festival season when demand for most commodities goes up. KATHMANDU: Traders in Nepal have resumed importing onions from India to meet the soaring domestic demand ahead of a festival season, days after the supply was halted following India's decision to slap a 40 per cent export tax on the vegetable. Last week, India, the world's biggest exporter of onions, imposed a 40 per cent tariff on the export of the vegetable till December 31 to restrict overseas sales. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} The move reportedly came amid an anticipation of a price rise ahead of the festival season when demand for most commodities goes up. The new tariff had severely affected Nepal as several traders in the Kalimati Fruit and Vegetable Market - the Himalayan nation's largest wholesale market for agricultural products - reported a sudden scarcity of onions. Nepal imports 99 per cent of its onion requirements from India. Traders in Nepal imported 265 tonnes of onions from India in the last 48 hours which helped resume smooth supply of the vegetable ahead of the festival season. On Wednesday, 120 tonnes of onions were imported from India, and on Thursday, 145 tonnes came till noon, said Binaya Shrestha, spokesperson at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board. Wholesale price of onions has been fixed at Rs. 75 per kg after the tax adjustment, he said. The traders had halted the import of onions on Monday and Tuesday after India imposed the export duty on the vegetable. The price of onions which was sold at Rs. 70 per kg in the retail market has now jumped to Rs. 100 after the imposition of export tax. However, the supply has become smooth, there is no shortage of onions in the market even though the traders have started hoarding the vegetable after India announced the tariff. The Customer Protection Division under the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies has intensified market monitoring activities over the last week following complaints from some consumer groups about shortage and price hikes of onions. In the last four days, market monitoring was conducted at more than 30 places, said Ghanashyam Subedi , director of the division. He said those found to be charging unreasonably higher prices have been fined as per the consumer protection laws. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Nepal onion trade nepal onion export india kalimati fruit onion traders ghanashyam subedi (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

In 2022, the foundation impacted over 6.4 lakh lives through 15 skilling projects, offering courses in foundational, emerging and advanced technologies. In an interaction with ET digital, Bhasin explains how the foundation is creating access to technology at the grassroots level via the (government’s) Aspirational Districts Programme. Edited excerpts: Economic Times (ET): How is the nasscom foundation nurturing the TechForGood ecosystem — which strives to unleash the power of technology by providing access and opportunity to those in need — in India through its various programmes and initiatives? Nidhi Bhasin (NB): Established in 2001, we have witnessed how technology has brought about a transformative impact on people's lives, particularly those in the marginalised segments of society. As a non-profit organisation representing the Indian IT industry, our unwavering commitment lies in our core philosophy of TechForGood. Transformation of communities through technology form the very cornerstones of all the nasscom foundation’s programmes. To create access to technology at the grassroots level, we launched our aspirational districts programme (nasscom's programme focuses on inclusive growth and meeting SDG commitments) dedicated to empower marginalised communities in the aspirational districts of India by promoting digital literacy and enhanced access to government schemes. We have already established digital resource centres in 47 districts across 20 states to promote digital literacy. By the end of 2023, we aim to impact 1.8 million lives. Other key intervention areas include enabling women entrepreneurship in rural regions where we offer them with digital, financial and entrepreneurship skills to foster a more inclusive and diverse entrepreneurial ecosystem. Another key focus area is skilling and employability. Our skilling programmes ensure that all of India — including the youth, women, individuals from the LGBTQAI+ communities and PwDs (persons with disabilities) — has the new-age technological and contemporary skills crucial to meeting the demands of the booming sector and enhancing workplace productivity. Scalability and sustainability are crucial for the success of our initiatives. We understand the diverse nature of our country and, therefore, integrate social innovation into business practices, ensuring that inclusion remains at the forefront of decision-making processes within public and private platforms. Collaboration is pivotal in designing and implementing programmes with significant social impact, enabling us to reach a broader audience and drive meaningful change. Empowering the NGO ecosystem in India is also one of our key priorities. Through our BigTech programme, we extend vital support to over a thousand NGOs, offering tech solutions, volunteering opportunities, product donations and tech capacity building. By harnessing the potential of technology, we aim to maximise our impact and actively contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. ET: What kind of initiatives nasscom foundation is taking in terms of skilling, reskilling and upskilling at ground level? NB: Last year alone, the foundation has positively impacted over 6.4 lakh lives through 15 skilling projects offering courses in foundational, emerging, and advanced technologies. Ten of these projects specifically focused on providing placement opportunities for the youth, with over 400 employers offering opportunities to our trained candidates. Inclusivity lies at the core of the skilling and employability programme, as we strive to ensure that every individual in India possesses the relevant digital skills and enhanced employability necessary to access job opportunities in today's demanding work environment. With the support of renowned tech organisations collaborating with the foundation on various projects, we work with diverse groups. Through the programme, these beneficiaries from marginalised communities receive comprehensive technical knowledge from our implementation partners. They are provided with non-technical courses in communication skills and holistic personality development, equipping them to thrive in the evolving digital economy. The results have been remarkable as 67% of our beneficiaries are women proficient in emerging technologies. Additionally, we had also partnered with the Tamil Nadu Skill Development Corporation to train over 100 PwDs in tech-enabled skills. To enhance learning and skilling milestones, we have established 20 digital labs equipped with essentials, including computers, webcams and headphones, across the country. Our skilling programmes have reached more than 26 states, touching diverse communities and by the end of 2023, we would have skilled, reskilled or upskilled over 100,000 people. ET: How is nasscom foundation providing solutions to the existing socioeconomic challenges? How are you using technology to drive social change? NB: TechForGood is what we live by: Creating access to technology to address the socio-economic challenges faced by the most underserved populations. That is the core philosophy of all programmes run by the nasscom foundation. These could be enabling the NGO ecosystem, social enterprises, the tech industry, the government, or other for-profit enterprises. We strive to bring the tech ecosystem together to engineer social impact. In line with our commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we design each programme with a focus on quality education, gender equality, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation, infrastructure, reduced inequality, and partnerships for goals. We firmly believe that technology can catalyse the achievement of the SDG mission by 2030. We are dedicated to extending digital literacy to rural areas, recognising the importance of reaching the last mile to achieve widespread inclusive growth. Our journey began last year as we expanded our programmes from urban areas to tier-2 and -3 cities and rural regions. Through our TechForGood initiative, we work in enabling the NGO ecosystem with the necessary tools and resources they need to thrive in the digital age. We understand that technology can be a game-changer for these organisations, enabling them to streamline operations, scale up their initiatives, and drive meaningful change at a larger scale. Through our BigTech programme, we bring together global tech companies to offer subsidised tech products (software) and services specifically tailored for non-profits. By partnering with leading tech providers and being the exclusive partner in India, we ensure that NGOs have access to authentic software solutions at affordable prices. Furthermore, we actively engage with NGOs through webinars to listen attentively to their unique challenges, aspirations and requirements. By understanding their specific needs, we can provide customised solutions, making technology accessible and applicable to their work. Recognising the significance of social innovation and entrepreneurship, we actively encourage young individuals with an entrepreneurial spirit to pursue social entrepreneurship. By addressing critical challenges in areas like education, healthcare and sustainability, they can create a positive impact on society. ET: What kind of initiatives are you taking in terms of fostering entrepreneurial values amongst women in rural India? NB: We are deeply committed to promoting gender equality and empowering women to become successful independent entrepreneurs. In rural India, we recognise the immense potential and talent that exists among women, and we believe that creating an environment that supports their entrepreneurial aspirations is crucial for economic growth and social development. The WEP is designed to help women entrepreneurs get technology and digital skills. The programme provides upskilling training on digital and financial literacy, and entrepreneurial skills to equip women entrepreneurs with essential abilities for their success. We have empowered over 1,00,000 rural women beneficiaries through various projects that train them to leverage social media platforms like YouTube, Pinterest and WhatsApp Business to promote their products, access relevant government schemes and reach a wider audience. The programme has also trained them to use digital payments and formal banking services to enhance their enterprise. ET: Can you take us through your Aspirational Districts Programme? NB: Launched in December last year, nasscom foundation’s Aspirational Districts Programme is a step forward in making India a digitally empowered nation and transforming India's inclusive growth story. Through this initiative, we aim to digitally enable and skill more than 3.5 million lives by March 2024. The goal is to achieve a digitally empowered society and economy by addressing digital literacy and bridging the skilling gap at the last mile. Currently, 55 districts across 23 states have been identified. We have established and operationalised 47 digital resource centers in 20 states, promoting digital literacy and skilling initiatives and we have successfully empowered one million lives. These centers act as change agents and engines of development, providing essential information, resources, and government services to positively impact citizens' lives and livelihoods. We have trained and empowered 1,000 community members as digital ambassadors, with 46% of them being women. The programme prioritises technology and digital knowledge, empowering youth, and aspiring women entrepreneurs to improve the community and society's quality of life. It also generates awareness of government schemes and e-governance services, alongside imparting quality training in digital skills. Beneficiaries have availed benefits from around 35 schemes and services, with 65% using services like the Pradhan Mantri Sukanya Samridhi Yojana, Labour Card, Digital Health card, PAN card and Aadhar Card. Over 72% have applied for loans. The programme has led to a significant increase in smartphone usage, particularly among females, improving access to information and knowledge on welfare schemes. 94% of community members are aware of the benefits of digital technology, and 98% of men and 94% of women have recognised the importance of savings for future planned and unplanned expenditures. ET: What are your plans? NB: Our vision is to foster digital transformation, paving the way for an inclusive, sustainable, and progressive India by harnessing the power of technology to tackle pressing social challenges. With a positive impact already on over 5 million lives, our ambitious goal is to impact over 100 million individuals by 2026. We eagerly seek collaboration with organisations and partners who share our vision of using TechForGood. While we have established 47 aspirational districts, our aim is to extend our reach to even more districts, making a meaningful impact on diverse communities. Our ultimate long-term objective aligns with the nation's goal of nurturing a digital economy that promotes inclusive growth. We are determined to expand our footprint, benefiting more individuals and communities, and above all, championing digital freedom for all. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Nidhi Bhasin nasscom Nidhi bhasin MSME nasscom foundation Women Entrepreneurship Program spirational Districts Programme (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "ANI Story outline Nitin Kunkolienker, President Emeritus of MAIT and Director, Electronics Product Foundation (EPIC), says that the budget should have focussed more on the facilitation of exports. A Sakthivel, President, FIEO, says there is a need to encourage aggressive marketing. While the allocation for the Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme has increased from Rs 160 crore in 2022-23 to Rs 200 crore in 2023-24, this may not be adequate. Industry experts are of the view that there has not been much emphasis on promotion of exports in the Union Budget 2023-2024. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Presenting the budget on Wednesday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted customs reforms and duty rate changes that could benefit the exports sector. “Customs’ reforms have played a very vital role in domestic capacity creation, providing level playing field to our MSMEs, easing the raw material supply-side constraints, enhancing ease of doing business and being an enabler to other policy initiatives such as PLIs and phased manufacturing plans,” she stated. Talking about how this will aid the objective of Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat , the minister said that the removal of exemption on items that can be manufactured in India and offering concessional duties on raw materials that go into manufacturing of intermediate products would be beneficial. Experts say that such measures will help in building an ecosystem of parts and components that can be manufactured in India. “It will enable a conducive vendor ecosystem to be built in India. Such incentives seem to address the granular aspects of the PLI scheme so that parts are made in India. However, besides that, exports as a segment did not get any special emphasis. Perhaps more specific sector export promotion measures are likely to be addressed by the Foreign Trade Policy,” says Atul Gupta, Partner, Deloitte India. Gupta adds that the global recessionary trends may have acted as a dampener. “There has been no increase in Market Development Assistance. One big demand of industry body FIEO (Federation of Indian Export Organisations) was the creation of an export promotion fund, which also hasn't come by.” Some of the other exemptions in the budget were for items such as embellishments, trimming, fasteners, buttons, zipper, lining material, specified leather, furniture fittings and packaging boxes that may be needed by bonafide exporters of handicrafts, textiles and leather garments, leather footwear and other goods. Duty, the budget stated, was also being reduced on certain inputs required for shrimp aquaculture so as to promote exports. Nitin Kunkolienker, President Emeritus of MAIT and Director, Electronics Product Foundation (EPIC), says that the budget should have focussed more on the facilitation of exports. “The government has to touch upon the value chain. There are a lot of issues in the value chain. Ports are located in states and there is a lot of apathy in states. Look at port connectivity and labour issues at play. We may talk of ease of doing business, but when you start importing or exporting via ports, labour does not cooperate if their demands are not met. Such issues are not dealt with and these impact the overall system,” he says. Echoing similar views, A Sakthivel, President, FIEO, says there is a need to encourage aggressive marketing. While the allocation for the Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme has increased from Rs 160 crore in 2022-23 to Rs 200 crore in 2023-24, this may not be adequate. “Global trade shows are increasingly giving opportunities for showcasing goods, and this needs to be exploited. A planned scheme for aggressive overseas marketing may be notified with a sizeable corpus to encourage exporters to showcase globally,” he says. India has seen a steady rising trajectory in exports. The country achieved an all-time high annual merchandise export of $422 billion in FY22, the Economic Survey had stated on Tuesday. However, it also added that the global economy has started facing formidable headwinds and the ripple effect of the global trade slowdown has started showing in India’s merchandise export growth, where a moderation in pace was observed in 2022. Talking about the services sector, it noted how India maintained its dominance in global services trade in FY22. “Despite pandemic-induced global restrictions and weak tourism revenues, India’s services exports stood at $254.5 billion in FY22 recording a growth of 23.5% over FY21 and registering a growth of 32.7% in April-September 2022 over the same period of FY22,” it added. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} ( Originally published on Feb 02, 2023 ) Read More News on exports budget exports budget budget 2023 Nirmala Sitharaman atmanirbhar bharat economic survey 2023 pli scheme (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

Vietnam was seen as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the US-China trade conflict. Recently, however, Vietnam’s allure as version 2.0 of the world’s factory floor has receded sharply. News trickling out of the country doesn’t bode well for companies looking to expand existing operations, or set up new ones there. Industrial production fell sharply in January, as did the number of those employed in the sector. Manufacturing activity contracted. Meanwhile, Vietnamese are turning to moonlighting and side hustles as blue-collar work slows. Wages continue to remain low and inflation is biting. Adding to the gloom, one of the largest shoemakers for Nike and Adidas, Taiwan’s Pou Chen Corp., is planning to cut 6,000 jobs at its Ho Chi Minh City plant. A pile of niggling domestic issues are making it tougher to do business in Vietnam, too. An anti-graft campaign that led to the sudden resignation of President Nguyen Xuan Phuc spooked investors. Vietnam was supposed to be stable, and this leadership change only served to highlight the emerging market-feel of volatile politics intertwined with business decisions and processes like getting permits, approvals, licenses and subsidies. That’s disruptive for foreign firms whose executives can quickly fall out of favor as officials in power come and go, delaying investments. Meanwhile, the country’s property sector faces a worsening debt crisis with its developers delaying repayments. For potential manufacturers, setting up with the help of domestic funding — as was the case in China — may prove challenging as it requires a lot more ongoing investment for working capital and trade finance. Much like the rest of the world, labor is becoming a prickly issue. After at least 28 strikes in 2022, in January, 600 workers in Ho Chi Minh City protested their Japanese employer Toyo Precision Co.’s meager year-end bonus at the sewing-machine-part facility, according to local media. For global companies, these challenges create more supply-chain complications just as they emerge from two years of struggling to smooth existing wrinkles and disruptions. After Covid-induced interruptions to production and profits, firms may have little patience to deal with more. The appeal of moving factories to Vietnam was, in large part, driven by labor costs. The prospect of cheaper wages — relative to other production centers — has historically underpinned shifts of technology to parts of Asia (think chip manufacturing and electronics). That calculus is no longer so simple: much of the rhetoric around moving supply chains assumes that just because there are millions of working-age people in a country, they are content with low wages. It ignores their inclination toward the services sector or inflationary pressures pinching employees (much as they are hurting companies) that makes it tougher to work these jobs. Meanwhile, India and Indonesia are emerging as alternatives. Increasingly, firms need more skilled employees as digitalization and automation gain traction. Even with the hype around Vietnam’s potential ascendancy as a vital cog in the global supply chain , it has struggled to shed the assembly-line label — as opposed to a production hub. Monthly, the country turns out over 400 million cigarette packs, more than 300 million ready-made garments, 17.2 million mobile phones and millions of square meters of polyester. Industrial-scale equipment and machinery, or parts for them, aren’t a mainstay, yet. Meanwhile, manufacturers still depend on China for parts and components, and moving up the value chain hasn’t proved easy. Japanese electronics firm Kyocera Corp., for instance, is expanding production of some components at its new Vietnam plant. However, the company noted last March it would only make more ceramic packages used in electronics for insulation and resistance, at this facility. The “cutting-edge small-sized packages for crystal devices are made in a highly complex way,” and it will continue to manufacture these “inside Japan for a while.” To be sure, Vietnam’s infrastructure — from ports to highways and power supply — is well-developed around industrial parks and economic zones, where most manufacturing activity is concentrated. Still, only 20% of roads are paved and logistics capacity hasn’t kept up with trade activity. With one of the brightest spots looking like it’s out of the race, what’s next for globalization? For one, the world’s factory floor isn’t going to be elbowed aside any time soon. Chinese companies are effectively exporting their supply chains and facilities to Europe and Mexico in a bid to ride the nearshoring trend. Meanwhile, it isn’t clear how much demand there actually is for a brand new supply chain ex-China. While 30% of Japanese manufacturers use imported goods, almost 50% don’t bring in components, according to a survey by Teikoku Databank at the end of December. Meanwhile, those that do rely on imports are now shying away given the weak yen makes it expensive to bring in goods. In India, companies import electronics and other bits from China, assemble them and add some economic value by putting in a few parts like a capacitor, a device that stores electric charge. The US has kicked off its own factory-building boom, leaning on friendly trade partners. The reality is industrial companies will manage to source the parts and components they need — some from China, others from Japan and Southeast Asia, and yet more from Mexico. Commercial ties will prevail and labor problems will abound as skilled manufacturing workers run short. Businesses will be forced to selectively decouple and certain sectors will struggle more than others. The higher the economic value of technology, the harder it’ll be to rely on others for it. There won’t be one new factory floor of the world to replace China. Just a new model of globalization to get used to. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} ( Originally published on Mar 01, 2023 ) Read More News on china supply chain Working capital Logistics vietnam supply chain (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

Regulatory Technology (Regtech) solutions company Teamlease Regtech on Tuesday released its report titled ‘ Simplifying Compliance Management for The Logistics & Supply Chain Industry’. The report examines sectoral concerns and gives an overview of the regulatory environment for the logistics and supply chain industry. It suggests specific action items that can help enterprises manage their compliance requirements more effectively. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} The report highlights the crucial role of the logistics industry in the economy. It employs 22 million people and is on track to reach a valuation of $215 billion in the next two years. The National Logistics Policy (NLP) was recently introduced to address the infrastructure and policy gaps in the industry. The objective of this policy is to reduce the cost of logistics from the current 14% of GDP to 8% of GDP by 2030. In addition, there has been a renewed focus on implementing technological solutions to push paperless trade operations and place India within the top 25 on the Logistics Performance Index (LPI). While there has been steady progress, Teamlease Regtech’s report demonstrates how the lack of an accurate and updated list of applicable compliances impede the industry’s growth. There is an overlap of documentation in the form of multiplicity of registrations, approvals, licenses, permissions, consent orders, and certifications among others, required for every warehouse. Companies operating in a single state with just one warehouse and a corporate office are required to comply with 648 regulations. These obligations rise significantly and ad-hoc, paper-based, and people-dependent processes fail to keep up as the company expands its scale and geographical footprint. In addition, businesses are also required to adhere to regulations related to the collection, transit, and delivery of products. The report also reveals that three major regulations of the industry, such as the Multimodal Transportation of Goods Act of 1993, the Carriage of Goods by Road Act of 2007, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act of 1925, the Merchant Shipping Act of 1958, and the Carriage by Air Act of 1972 all required updation. In a staggering revelation, around 91% of surveyed logistics and supply chain companies agreed that they have paid fines and penalties in the last 12-month period. Only by streamlining compliance by conducting a baseline applicability assessment, creating a central paperless compliance document repository, subscribing to real-time national and personalized regulatory updates and digitizing end-to-end compliance management can a business stay on the right side of the law. Rishi Agrawal, CEO and Co-Founder, Teamlease Regtech, said in a statement, “A robust logistics and supply chain industry is the key for India’s transformation as the factory of the world. The report looks into the logistics industry's regulatory environment to provide readers with an understanding of the complexities of the compliance landscape. It highlights the limitations and inefficiencies in the current compliance practices used by these businesses. It also makes recommendations that will allow these businesses to efficiently manage their compliance requirements through the use of digital procedures”. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} ( Originally published on Feb 28, 2023 ) Read More News on simplifying compliance management for teamlease teamlease regtech logistics supply chain (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "iStock The pandemic had fuelled a surge in consumer demand for goods that snarled global supply chains, propelling freight rates and shipping profits to unprecedented levels. These weakened significantly at the end of last year. French shipping giant CMA CGM SA, controlled by the billionaire Rodolphe Saade and his family, warned of a steep drop in demand so far this year, extending a slump that led to a more than halving of quarterly profit. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} A downturn that began in the second half of last year “remained at play in 2023, as market conditions in the transport and logistics industry continue to deteriorate,” the world’s third-largest container line said in a statement Friday. The company cited a sharp decrease in freight rates, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty. The bleak outlook from the French transporter is in line with European rivals A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S and Hapag-Lloyd AG, and points to a cooling period in the notoriously cyclical shipping market. The pandemic had fuelled a surge in consumer demand for goods that snarled global supply chains, propelling freight rates and shipping profits to unprecedented levels. These weakened significantly at the end of last year. CMA CGM’s net income more than halved to $3.04 billion during the fourth quarter from $6.71 billion in the final three months of the previous year. Despite the drop, full-year profit for 2022 rose to a record $24.9 billion, surpassing the $17.9 billion in 2021. “The balance between supply and demand is expected to remain challenging, as capacity is expected to increase,” the company said, referring to an easing of port congestion and delivery of new vessels in shipping and more cargo capacity on planes. CMA CGM has 63 new vessels on order, the company says. Still, the company said “certain macroeconomic signals are stabilising,” with US consumers and the labor market remaining resilient, a European recession being “avoided for the moment,” and some emerging markets in Latin America and Asia staying strong. The pandemic boom filled the coffers of the Saades and rival European shipping tycoons like Gianluigi Aponte, founder of Mediterranean Shipping Co., and Klaus-Michael Kuehne, who has stakes in logistics and shipping companies. Closely held CMA CGM hasn’t yet announced a payout for 2022. The latest results could help get CMA CGM out of political hot water in France, where some lawmakers have called for a windfall tax on the company due to its high profits. Saade, the second-generation head of the carrier, has so far avoided any such penalty. He has invested some profits to reduce carbon emissions, as well as to expand operations in ports, logistics, air cargo and media. With a private fleet of some 593 vessels, the Saade family is worth $24 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on shipping cma cgm freight demand Rodolphe Saade maersk global supply chain ship french shipping (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "iStock Business activity expanded in early June at the slowest pace in three months, held back by a deeper contraction in manufacturing. The Bank of England stepped up efforts to beat back the worst inflation since the 1980s by boosting interest rates half a percentage point to the highest level in 15 years. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} The move surprised investors who had priced in a 40% chance of a hike of that magnitude. BOE policymakers also reiterated earlier guidance pointing to even higher rates, similar to the message Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell conveyed to US lawmakers this week. Central bankers in Norway joined the BOE in accelerating their rate increases, while Switzerland dialed back its pace of hiking. Here are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy : World Bloomberg In addition to the UK, Norway raised its benchmark rate a half point to 3.75%, while central banks in Indonesia, the Philippines, Mexico and Brazil left borrowing costs unchanged. The Swiss National Bank delivered its smallest hike since policy tightening began a year ago, while saying more action is likely. Bloomberg The creeping rot inside commercial real estate is like a dark seam running through the global economy. Even as stock markets rally and investors are hopeful that the fastest interest-rate increases in a generation will ebb, the trouble in property is set to play out for years. Europe Bloomberg UK core inflation, which excludes food and energy, accelerated unexpectedly to a 31-year high of 7.1% in May, helping explain the BOE’s decision to raise interest rates a half percentage point. Separate data showed government debt now exceeds the size of the UK economy for the first time since 1961, imperiling Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s promise to restore health to the public finances and cut inflation. Bloomberg Economic momentum in the euro area almost came to a halt in June, signaling an end to the revival the bloc demonstrated since its winter downturn. A purchasing managers index compiled by S&P Global fell to a five-month low. Bloomberg Germany’s rollout of ultra-cheap public transport last summer is set to reverberate through its upcoming inflation readings, causing a headache for the European Central Bank. Asia Bloomberg South Korean exports offered an early sign of improvement in global trade after their first year-on-year gain since last summer. Preliminary trade figures showed a 5.3% gain in exports in the first 20 days of June from a year ago for the first increase since August, a possible sign that a slowdown in world demand is starting to ease. Bloomberg Singapore’s core inflation rate cooled in May to the lowest in 11 months, helped by a deceleration in transport and food prices. US Bloomberg Sales of previously owned homes barely rose in May as high mortgage rates continued to crimp demand and discourage owners from listing their properties. The median selling price declined 3.1% from a year earlier, the most since 2011, to $396,100. That’s still historically elevated for the month and reflective of limited supply. Bloomberg Business activity expanded in early June at the slowest pace in three months, held back by a deeper contraction in manufacturing. Healthy demand for services stood in sharp contrast to a further deterioration at factories. The manufacturing gauge fell to a six-month low, with new orders matching the fastest rate of contraction since May 2020. Bloomberg The so-called Great Retirement is looking a little less great lately, as stalled house prices and the rising cost of living push some older workers back into the labor force, new research shows. Emerging Markets Bloomberg Mexico kept borrowing costs unchanged for a second month as the central bank vows to maintain its restrictive stance over the coming months while inflation continues to show signs of cooling. Bloomberg Egypt looked past a pick-up in inflation to keep interest rates unchanged for a second month, with the central bank’s next bout of monetary tightening likely hinging on the country’s ability to secure the foreign exchange needed to manage another currency devaluation.

Industry 4.0 is another term for being smart – being informed, enabled, connected, quick to identify/analyse and fast to respond. At its core, Industry 4.0 has three important aspects – data, technology and human capital. Together, these three aspects have created countless new opportunities, as well as challenges, for businesses and for their Human Resource ( HR ) functions. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Here are some insights into how the HR function has moved from traditional operating models. Today’s HR professionals are riding the crest and empowering industry to harmonise its business strategies with talent management. Emerging HR Trends An important HR trend is the focus on reskilling and upskilling of the workforce. As automation and digitisation have begun to augment many routine and manual tasks, HR has been enabling the workforce to acquire new skills and competencies that are relevant for new roles and tasks, created by Industry 4.0. HR teams are going all out to invest in continuous learning and development programs that help workers update their knowledge and skills and prepare them for the future of work. Another emerging HR trend is its response to the shift from hierarchical to networked organisations. As Industry 4.0 entails more collaboration across different functions, locations and stakeholders, organisations are finding that they need to be more flexible and agile. This is where the HR function is proving invaluable, by fostering a culture of trust and empowerment, where employees can work autonomously or in teams, share ideas and feedback, and leverage their diverse perspectives and expertise. HR functions are redesigning the performance management and reward systems, to align with the networked organisation model and incentivise collaboration and invention. A third HR trend that is making a definite imprint is the integration of human and machine intelligence. As modern technologies augment human capabilities and enable new forms of data analysis and decision making, organisations must leverage the strengths of both, humans and machines, to optimise their outcomes. HR has been instrumental in redefining roles and responsibilities within the organisation, ensuring that humans can focus on tasks that require creativity, empathy, and judgment, while machines can handle tasks that require speed, accuracy, and consistency. HR operating models of the future A 2023 report by Gartner notes that HR operating models of the future will be characterised by increased agility, automation, and a focus on employee experience. It will be dominated by Digitalisation and automation of HR processes allowing for faster and more efficient workflows. Agile methodologies to respond quickly to changing business needs and practices that are aligned with business goals. Employee experience will be centre stage, with HR teams providing personalised support and services to employees. Data analytics will be increasingly used to make data-driven decisions, identify trends, and optimise people processes. While there is no doubt that Industry 4.0 is reshaping the world of work, HR teams across the globe have risen to the challenge, embraced this change and reworked their strategies and practices accordingly. This function which is pretty much the backbone of the industry has been helping organisations achieve competitive advantage and sustainable growth in the era of Industry 4.0.

Whether I am scouting for experienced candidates or freshers, it is a constant grind to find suitable people to fill job profiles. In many cases, the effort is wasted when a bad hire pulls down the department, his/her peers, and ends up costing more in indirect terms such as low productivity, quite quitting, etc. Of course, we are trained to avoid that, but the current 10:1 candidate vs. hiring ratio is very demoralising, and I sincerely wish we could improve it.” #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} - Radha, HR manager in an MNC ET Spotlight As an experienced HR professional, Radha is no stranger to balancing recruitment, retention, and attrition. In fact, it is the only constant in her job. However, she often feels that the pool of candidates never gets better; filtering good prospects is complex and seems to be getting more complicated. For every 15 CVs she receives, only 1 promising candidate gets an offer letter. With nothing else to change and faced with hiring for a new client project, she considers integrating a tech tool to filter her candidates. “I was quite surprised to see that the number of shortlisted CVs had increased by almost 30 percent! When I manually went through some of these they were completely up to the standards we had set. As we proceeded with the coding assessments, we saw a significant uptick in the number of candidates making it to the next stage. Finally, the hiring ratio has plummeted!” Says Radha about the experience. So, what happened? Technology is not magic; but it is a great equaliser! Adding a layer of unbiased technology, Radha was able to identify candidates based only on skills and their personality. HR professionals bring an empathetic outlook to candidate selection but unconscious bias, rigid selection criteria or sometimes even personal habits tend to mould early stage recruitment. Adding a layer of technology, ensures that no promising candidate is overlooked - ever. Radha’s organisation used Think Exam’s AI-based recruitment solutions to assess candidates for a range of skills and accomplishments. Hiring programmers for a certain client, the assessments were focused on finding the right skill from the right person, hence the tests covered domain expertise, a hackathon and personality and behavioural testing. ET Spotlight Co-founder & CTO Ankit Khandelwal. These assessments were auto-generated via an external software, Think Exam’s test library, to match the skills and mindset needed for the job profile. The results and reports generated at the end were also automated. Minimising human contact in the first few rounds ensured that only the most suitable candidates came to the fore. The technology was led throughout by Radha’s team who used their professional experience to make sure that the software was constantly monitored and tweaked to get the best outcomes. Ultimately, the team hired better, faster and cheaper! If you are an HR manager wondering how to reduce your assess-to-hire ratio, get in touch with Think Exam. Maybe all you need to do is to test candidates differently to find the right fit employee. Connect with our consultants to find out how our tech tools can fit into your current recruitment process.

    "article_content": "iStock CEOs worldwide are stepping up investments in AI, especially Generative AI, to gain a competitive edge. It is never easy to present an outlook on what the future might hold. And if it was difficult before, it has become almost impossible now when the trends reverse and the developments can be undone suddenly, and in most unexpected ways. Who could have imagined a pandemic like Covid-19, and the level of disruption it would cause? Who can predict wars or natural disasters or the eruption of geopolitical tensions? Yet, all these things have been happening, with alarming frequency in recent years. And all of them have a direct, inescapable impact on business. CEOs face the unenviable task of anticipating future trends, growing the business, making it sustainable, and insulating the business and its people against possible disruptions – all at once. I believe there are some key areas that will present both opportunities and challenges for CEOs in the coming years. AI: The inevitable plunge #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} CEOs worldwide are stepping up investments in AI, especially Generative AI, to gain a competitive edge. Although they believe that the cost of implementing AI technologies will be significant, many expect to see a return on their investment in 3-5 years. Indian CEOs too, like their global counterparts, believe that these technologies will open unprecedented business opportunities in developing new value propositions, servicing customers, driving efficiencies and reducing cost. However, like most technologies, AI too is a double-edged sword. For example, while AI can help organisations detect cyberattacks at speed, it can also enable cyber criminals to develop new attack strategies. There are also risks related to ethical issues, unknown boundaries, and regulations, to name a few. Organisations need to work towards building more transparent and responsible systems. As the scrutiny of AI increases, the governments are likely to develop new regulations. While there are no AI-specific regulations in India currently, several other countries have started developing laws to regulate AI. In the recent years, the Indian government has managed to strike a good balance between governance and innovation. Continuing with the same principle will require a non-traditional approach and creative governance mechanism. Defining and walking the ESG path Most CEOs believe that ESG will shape the agenda for their companies in the future. However, there are many who view ESG as a burden and an impediment to “business as usual”. I think there is nothing “usual” about business anymore; one must constantly adapt to the global environment and contribute to making the world a better, more livable place. ESG is the means to do that. It nudges us to look at new ways of making the business more resilient and capable of delivering long-term growth even in the face of geopolitical and economic challenges. However, data suggests that not all CEOs have fully incorporated ESG into their corporate strategy yet. Furthermore, although CEOs are, by and large, well aware of ESG requirements, majority of them admit that the pace and progress of their ESG initiatives falls short of expectations. Moreover, there is a huge talent gap in ESG-related roles. Organisations should try and close this gap at the earliest – either by hiring ESG-certified talent, or by training their workforce. Building a culture of hybrid working and Inclusion One of the biggest challenges for organisations today is to find the best balance between working remotely and working in office. Most CEOs in India believe that the workforce will return to the pre-pandemic mode of working within the next three years. Almost 89 percent said they were considering the idea of encouraging office attendance by linking it directly to rewards, raises, or promotions. I would advise caution on this front, though. There is evidence to suggest that several categories of workforce prefer a hybrid mode of working. Trying to force or entice a complete return to office may prove counterproductive. The other big workforce-related challenge is hiring. Finding the right people for the right roles is more difficult than it appears. CEOs largely agreed that they sought to hire the best talent, irrespective of location. They also said they were mindful of the need to foster Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity (IDE). Curiously, although CEOs widely acknowledge that gender equity will help them achieve business growth, they also believe that IDE implementation has moved slower than they would have liked. This calls for urgent attention because the IDE performance of organisations is likely to come under increasing scrutiny in the coming years. Seldom in the past have CEOs operated in as agile and as challenging a business environment as the one we have today. Despite all these challenges, the Indian CEOs see growth potential for their companies. But then, that is precisely their job – to find a way around obstacles and to make the most of opportunities that emerge. It is their outlook, more than that of any industry observer, that ultimately matters.

    "article_content": "iStock The business world has no shortage of challenges and changes that demand serious thought. The reversal of globalisation is forcing changes in everything from strategy to organisation. Management advice is one of the world’s most successful industries. Business schools have turned into the training ground of the new elite. Management consultancies bestride the world dispensing advice. In 2023, the US alone had more than two million management consultants and almost 115,000 business professors. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Yet this multibillion-dollar industry has lost the intellectual momentum and edge that it had during the 1980s and 1990s, when business schools and management consultancies reverberated with new thinking, and businesspeople hyperventilated over every new issue of the Harvard Business Review . Michael Porter redesigned strategic thinking by applying economic theory to business conundrums. Michael Hammer re-engineered the corporation for the age of smart machines. Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad anatomised the core competences of the corporation while Christopher Bartlett and Sumantra Ghoshal offered multinationals advice on how to restructure themselves for a new age of hyper-globalisation. Both the ideas and excitement have long since evaporated. The last flurry of new thinking arguably came in the early 2000s with the invention of Agile in the tech world (teams got into regular “scrums” to innovate and fix things) and the discovery of new markets in the emerging world (Prahalad argued that there was a “fortune at the bottom of the pyramid” if you could learn how to sell to the poor by, for example, selling small packets of washing powder). Since then, little or nothing. The biggest new idea that is doing the rounds — stakeholder capitalism — is neither new nor, strictly speaking, an idea. In 2019, the Business Roundtable declared portentously that “for long-term success companies must deliver for all stakeholders.” But critics of Anglo-Saxon capitalism have been making similar arguments since the invention of the limited liability company in the middle of the 19th century. And the Roundtable’s statements did not address the questions that a real theory would have to confront: Who exactly is a “stakeholder”? How do you make trade-offs between different constituencies? And what does stakeholder theory mean for, say, executive pay? Most companies continued just as before, certainly when it came to executive remuneration, while sprinkling their annual reports with saccharine phrases about “purpose.” Why is so much “input” (all those professors and consultants) leading to so little “output”? Part of the answer lies in the maturity of the industry. There are only so many ideas that you can have about managing people or resources, and many of the best were generated long ago. Two management thinkers — Gary Hamel and Michele Zanini — have produced an “S” curve diagram of management innovation (based on research conducted with Julian Birkinshaw of London Business School ). It takes off slowly in the 1880s with scientific management, profit sharing and R&D labs, accelerates from the 1920s to the 2000, and then flattens out. A combination of maturity and over-ripeness has gummed up the two great engines of the management industry. Business schools have imported all the defects of the surrounding academic environments — specializing in walled off sub-disciplines such as marketing, on the one hand, and windy statements about the evils of capitalism, on the other. Consultancies became so obsessed with growth that they compromised their ethics (McKinsey once advised Johnson & Johnson to turbocharge growth in the opioid market by targeting “high abuse-risk patients”) and are now trying to compensate by engaging in woke-washing (McKinsey’s various websites are compendiums of the latest woke fads). A second explanation lies in the reversal of many of the trends that drove the management boom of the 1980s and 1990s. Whatever the world is today it is certainly not “borderless,” as Kenichi Ohmae predicted. The reigning management gurus of the golden age also pushed neoliberalism too far: Michael Jensen’s “agency theory” encouraged CEOs to demand ever more ludicrous rewards while Michael Hammer’s reengineering theory encouraged companies to “downsize” almost as a routine. No wonder today’s management theorists prefer to stick to the small scale. Michele Zanini presents a particularly intriguing explanation of what is going on: consolidation and complacency. The management boom took off in the United States in the 1980s because American companies were “getting hammered” by foreign competitors, particularly from Japan. They had no choice but to think about new ways to organize themselves or produce things. People got excited about Tom Peters’ work on excellence or Jensen’s theory of the firm because they saw them as ways of reviving organizations that might otherwise be doomed (In Search of Excellence, co-written by Peters and Robert Waterman, sold 3 million copies within four years and Jensen’s article, co-written with William Meckling, “Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure” became one of the most cited articles in the history of economics. By contrast, today’s leading US companies are fat and happy. Not only has American capitalism seen off the threat from Japan. US companies dominate their respective markets not just in tech but also in manufacturing and retail. The Economist calculates that, since 1990, the average age of companies in the Fortune 500 has increased from 75 to 90. These incumbents focus on fine-tuning their management machines with incremental ideas or on defending their walls by buying up rivals rather than on the wholesale rethinking of markets. Zanini argues that they tolerate management bloat (those ever-expanding HR departments) because they are making such healthy profits. Does the stagnation of management ideas matter? We have already conceded a downside to the golden age. Reengineering and agency theory had serious downsides. Faddism disorientated many employees. I nevertheless think that the great stagnation is a problem. Researchers led by Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University and John Van Reenen of the London School of Economics estimate that better management accounts for roughly a quarter of the 30% productivity advantage of US over European companies. General Motors crushed Ford in the 1920s and 1930s because it invented a new management idea — the multidivisional firm (that is giving different divisions within GM responsibility for different cars). And Toyota in turn crushed General Motors because it listened to ideas about “total quality management.” The best management gurus such as Peter Drucker have shown a genius not only for identifying management problems but also for helping to solve them. The business world has no shortage of challenges and changes that demand serious thought. The reversal of globalisation is forcing changes in everything from strategy to organisation. The revival of industrial policy is compelling firms to engage with politics in a way they have not needed to since the 1970s. Some Asian companies threaten to become global challengers to the West in the way that Japanese companies did in the 1980s. And AI promises to rewrite some of the fundamental rules of business. The biggest danger of not producing new ideas is that we will revert unthinkingly to old ideas: Multinational companies, for example, will revert to the national fiefdoms of the 1970s despite the information revolution or rely on the old technique of employing retired politicians to give them political advice despite the volatility created by populism. AI is spreading scientific management techniques to knowledge workers — break work down into distinctive tasks, make liberal use of sticks and carrots and monitor everything the worker does — despite ample evidence that, over the long-term, scientific management lowers both morale and productivity. The only way to escape being trapped by old thinking is to produce some new thinking. The sooner the better. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on business idea business school management consultancies michael porter harvard business review c k prahalad (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

The beauty of a heart-driven business model lies in putting co-workers on center stage, as it grants them independence to realize their full potential. Steered by love and understanding that people are more productive in a serene atmosphere, heart-based leadership offers an empathy-based approach to leading businesses with genuineness. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Daniel Goleman, co-director of the Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations at Rutgers University , understood what heart-based leadership entails after an insightful meeting with the Dalai Lama about three decades ago at Amherst College. A chance meeting developed into a “rich” bond of friendship. On the 80th birthday of the spiritual leader (now 88), Goleman was asked to write a book unfolding the Dalai Lama’s “compassionate approach” to leadership even when facing seemingly intractable problems. Published in 2015, the book Force for Good: The Dalai Lama’s Vision for Our World offers a unique perspective on cognitive empathy that enables a leader to appreciate what the other person feels. Not only do empathetic leaders lead by example in pressure cooker situations, they also have a knack for using emotional intelligence. This motivates their co-workers to think out of the box and revel in their creative side. The argument is backed by empirical research. Gallup conducted an exhaustive research study of about 10,000 employees in which they were specifically asked what sort of leadership attracted them, why it matters, and how it brings the best out of them. Four leadership skills stood out: trust, compassion , stability, and hope. All these skills are at the core of heart-driven leadership . In this pro-people approach, a leader places trust in co-workers, is compassionate, and offers stability and hope. In today’s Artificial Intelligence-driven age, a business model driven by heart is bound to achieve extraordinary success by changing peoples’ lives, for good. It is a process; not an event. One needs inner peace, joy, and selflessness to rise above the ego . Compassion means paving the way for an environment in which the individual growth of co-workers contributes positively to team success. In the fast-paced world consumed by ego, selfish desires, and hunger for more power, it is easy to lose sight of the essence of love. However, love helps one to stay modest and know that possession is no devotion. This powerful emotion offers direction and grants those around real freedom. On the contrary, a business without a soul is merely a materialistic transaction that fails to leave a mark or legacy behind. It remains a profit-making endeavor only. One is tempted to ask how pragmatic it is to create a heart-driven business model when it is human nature to earn more and more profits. The answer lies in the 3 Es. Ego Many of us want our ego to be massaged, perhaps all the time. Ego is a dangerous speedbreaker on the highway to real accomplishment as a business entrepreneur. The most self-aware leaders are quick to recognize the signals of abuse of power. They don’t waste time in setting things right. Self-awareness is also a process. One way to dial down the ego is to surround yourself with people who know more than you and won’t shy away from offering you honest feedback, including critical comments. Your trust in their integrity will hold the key. Such individuals keep you grounded by offering constructive criticism for your growth. The ones who slam the doors shut for learning remain in the dark and won’t become self-aware to avoid egotistical thinking. The culture of self-congratulatory chatter would mean the absence of capacity in a leader to tolerate and respect dissenting views. Empowerment The next stage is the act of summoning courage to empower those around you without feeling insecure. The ability to build meaningful collaborations with kindness empowers you to empower others. A true leader understands the pulse of his/her co-workers and finds joy in their success. They grow together. The real test, however, for a social entrepreneur lies in ensuring that the empowered co-workers are also individuals wholeheartedly driven by compassion. Managerial diktats cannot replace compassion. Ecosystem Showering love may still not be enough. Showing empathy is a job half done. The act of creating a reliable ecosystem to enhance the self-esteem of co-workers completes the cycle. There is a danger of losing the plot when one occupies a position of power. Throughout history, many have shown a negative shift in their behavior and attitude by wearing power on their sleeves. In such a situation, the ones around you are fearful and won’t offer honest feedback due to the fear of reprimand or reprisal. Enough empirical research is available to showcase that people who gain power may suffer “deficits in empathy”. Christine M. Riordan, professor of management at the University of Kentucky , in one of the essays argues that “the ability and willingness to listen with empathy is often what sets a leader apart.” That is perhaps why it is important to awaken the soul to remember one’s roots. Good leaders read the signs well and go back to the drawing room and work on achievement, not fame. Yes, fame creates its own authority. But the real power lies in heart-based leadership.

    "article_content": "iStock The organic word-of-mouth marketing has a ripple effect. Forget the flashy ads and polished campaigns—this is the era of authenticity, and user-generated content (UGC) is leading the charge. In advertising , user-generated content has become a new tool for advertisers, transforming how brands connect with their audience. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} User generated content helps start conversations in social groups, which in turn creates relevance and mind space, which any purely brand led monologue can never achieve. Imagine a world where your customers are not just buyers, but storytellers. That's the magic of UGC—it's not scripted. It is real. In a time when consumers side-eye traditional marketing , authenticity is the golden ticket. UGC delivers that refreshing dose of genuine experiences and opinions that resonates with audiences personally. Social media , our modern-day stage, has catapulted the impact of user-generated content to new heights. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok have turned everyday consumers into virtual brand ambassadors, sharing their unfiltered experiences with products and services. This organic word-of-mouth marketing has a ripple effect, reaching a vast online audience and building trust like never before. But what makes UGC even more appealing is its budget-friendly nature. Forget hefty production costs and elaborate campaigns; user-generated content thrives on the creativity and enthusiasm of your audience. This cost-effective approach levels the playing field, allowing businesses of all sizes to maximize their reach without burning a hole in their pockets. It's not just about cost; it's about community. User-generated content transforms your customers from passive observers to active contributors to your brand's story. This collaborative effort creates a sense of ownership and pride among your audience, forging a connection that goes beyond a transactional relationship. Your customers become not just buyers but loyal advocates for your brand. In the trust game, user-generated content is the ace up your sleeve. Studies show that people trust recommendations from their peers more than traditional ads. UGC serves as a powerful form of social proof, showcasing real people using and loving your products. It's the genuine endorsement that nudges potential customers towards a purchase, knowing others have had positive experiences. Diversity is another win for user-generated content. Traditional ads often miss the mark on representing the varied backgrounds and experiences of consumers. UGC, on the other hand, is a melting pot of perspectives, creating a more inclusive and relatable brand image. It's not just marketing; it's a celebration of your diverse customer base. So, as we enter 2024, the importance of user-generated content in advertising isn't just a trend; it's a strategic game-changer. Its authenticity, budget-friendly appeal, and community-building prowess make it a must-have in any marketer's toolbox. In a world where consumer trust is the currency, user-generated content isn't just an option. It is the secret sauce for brands ready to thrive in the dynamic landscape of tomorrow. Moreover, the interactive nature of user-generated content contributes to a deeper level of engagement. Traditional advertisements often act as one-way communication, with brands talking to their audience. User-generated content flips the script, inviting customers to participate and engage with the brand actively. This two-way interaction fosters a sense of connection and involvement, making the audience feel valued and heard. UGC is not a one-size-fits-all strategy, it is versatile. Whether it is customer reviews, testimonials, social media posts, or videos, myriad forms of user-generated content exist to explore. This versatility allows brands to tailor their approach based on their audience and the nature of their products or services. From heartfelt stories to funny anecdotes, UGC provides a range of narratives that can be strategically aligned with a brand's image and messaging. In a nutshell, user-generated content is not just a buzzword, it is a fundamental shift in how brands and consumers interact. Its authenticity, cost-effectiveness, community-building potential, trustworthiness, diversity, and interactivity make it a force to be reckoned with in the advertising landscape of 2024. As businesses navigate the challenges of capturing and maintaining consumer attention, embracing user-generated content is not merely a trend; it's a strategic imperative for building lasting connections in the ever-evolving world of marketing.

    "article_content": "Getty Images A sustained track record of delivering results is key to building a brand and increasing its equity; there are no shortcuts or accelerated ways to achieve this. When it comes to marketing, the principles and philosophies are nearly identical around the world. After all, every type of marketing is aimed at people. Sure, there are cultural variations, geographical and demographic segmentations that give us millions of micro markets, but people, their needs, wants, and demands are somewhat similar. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Taste and preferences are wide; hence, we see hundreds of brands making the same commodity-say a shampoo or a car. There are variants and sub-brands-from entry level pricing to ultra-luxury, you can serve different markets if you carve out a strong brand differentiator and find the means to address the mass market. Despite the similarities and parallels in marketing concepts, they often become nearly irrelevant when targeting a B2B or B2G audience. Why is this the case? Aren't individuals in a B2B audience also human? How is it that their decision-making process differs when evaluating a brand for personal or family-use compared to making purchasing decisions for their organization? Here’s a practical way to understand this. Let’s say, Mr X, a 43-year old, married with two children, living in Mumbai, works as an admin at a mid-sized finance company. He needs to decide on a brand of water purifier to be installed at his office premises. Will he choose Kent, Aquaguard or Pureit? Let’s assume all three brands are similar in performance, features, price and aesthetics. Now imagine he’s going through the same evaluation to buy a water purifier for his home. What factors of purchase consideration will change when he’s at home versus office? Before you say L1 bid or pricing is the key factor, give it a moment’s thought. I will explain the difference subsequently. B2B purchase decisions are made on a list of ‘rationale’ parameters, including ROI, cost effectiveness, integration, scalability, and several more. And when it comes to personal decision making, the top evaluation criteria are ‘emotional’, followed by perceived value, convenience, loyalty, and more. As an individual, Mr X may perceive Kent to be a leading brand and swear by its safety, but he may have to set aside his opinion and buy Aquaguard at office since they already have an AMC running for three other water purifiers that are already installed, and he doesn’t have to look for a new sourcing vendor just to buy an additional unit. The rationale in this purchase journey is ‘integration.’ The new unit will gel well with the current unit. And trust me, this scenario of purchase evaluation may be similar irrespective of whether the procurement is for a twenty-thousand-rupee water filter or a two-million-dollar software upgrade. B2B buy-ology is strange like this! If you are a marketer or entrepreneur with a B2B audience as your primary target, here are a few ways to grow your business. Branding elements: Get the basics right, be it your website, portfolio decks, high quality PR content and news mentions, and so on. They are hygiene and must-haves. Do it well and do it right, and as quickly as possible. Advertising : Investing in advertising is not the same as business development, and when it comes to B2B, you know who you have to talk to, and nine out of ten times, a full-page ad on a newspaper or promoted post on social media may achieve nothing. You are better of spending the same or even lower amount of money than conventional advertising to participate / speak in industry events, or take up an exhibition booth at a relevant conference, pay to be a member of an industry body like IAMAI, ACMA etc., In most cases, a single B2B client’s business order value may be bigger than 10,000 B2C customers combined. For example, Nielsen gave a single deal worth $2.5bn to TCS; whereas Dabur, which claims 8 out of 10 Indian households use their products, has an annual revenue of Rs.11,000 crore ($1.4bn). In sum, when it comes to B2B advertising, it is not about awareness and top of mind metrics that apply to consumer brands, but finding key decision makers and establishing a connection to demonstrate your value proposition. If this means investing in highly experienced sales professionals, that is a better bet than lazily throwing money at ads. Accomplishments, or affiliations: If your work speaks for yourself, then invest significantly to create case studies, high-quality videos, blogs, and include client testimonials in them. For example, check out how AWS or ABB create case studies. If you are a newbie, use affiliation to strengthen your trust quotient, showcase your investors, mentors, start-up accelerator badges, past achievements, the collective experience of all stakeholders, etc. All you have to do is tell your prospect that you are not a fly-by-night entity and establish that you will deliver results as promised. Don’t get dragged by jargons or fads: Performance ads, native ads, influencer marketing -the tactics are endless. But you may not need any of them depending on the category and context of your b2b business. Rather, think clearly and invest in creating opportunities that connect you with key decision makers in the industry. For a new entity, doing a free of cost proof-of-concept to demonstrate capability to a prospective large enterprise is worth 100 times over ad dollars spent in terms of marketing ROI. Simplify your go to market: Irrespective of geography, when it comes to B2B business development, start with a small, distinct, or well-defined set of prospects to go after. For example, let us say you start a corporate gifts and stationery business based in Delhi. Don’t set a vague goal to go after any company with over 1000cr in turnover. Rather, consider something specific like, ‘we want to land three banks as our customers this quarter’ or ‘we want to close three PSUs in NCR before Diwali.’ The narrower your definition as who you want to land as a client, the higher the chance of conversion, and having worked with one brand from a category usually leads to opportunities with their competing brands. B2B marketing is about sales and business development. A sustained track record of delivering results is key to building a brand and increasing its equity; there are no shortcuts or accelerated ways to achieve this.

Television and radio have over the years helped in making this a powerful form of branding. Mumbai-based BrandMusiq , founded in 2011, has made sonic identity for brands such as Bru , Red Label , Vim , Raymond and Nestle , among others. Now, it has ventured into using artificial intelligence ( AI ) to optimise sonic branding in India. Talking about the evolution of Rajeev Raja , Founder and Soundsmith, BrandMusiq says, “Sonic signatures or jingles becoming associated with brands is not new. In the earlier days where television and radio were the lead mediums of communication, brands like Britannia, Titan, Raymond, Frooti, Airtel, Bajaj, etc, used music to create brand awareness and affinity. These pieces of music became strong brand assets and are associated with these brands, even today.“ The advertisements of Liril soap and Cadbury are some examples of how the jingles became part of these brands. Raja says brands are again taking a strategic look at creating enduring sonic identities, to differentiate themselves in today’s multi-sensorial, media-saturated digital age. In the era of digital and social media , there is a rise in audio-first devices, decline in consumer attention spans and an onslaught of visual-led advertising and content. Raja says that through sonic branding, companies can leverage the power of sound to convey the right emotion and engage deeper with their target audiences. “Social media is one of the ‘ear points’ or audio touchpoints in which we see a lot of sonic integration happening. Today, consumers spend a lot of time on social media and this has given brands the opportunity to reach a much wider audience. We are witnessing a significant increase in social media content — be it reels, podcasts and audio streaming platforms — giving brands a great opportunity to proliferate their sonic identity into a number of content formats which helps in increasing brand salience and recall,” he says. AI will play a critical role in this segment, whether at a validation level or even a creative one. “BrandMusiq is busy developing an AI-powered platform that will help in sonic identity customisation and regeneration, delivering tremendous value to clients by maximising speed, efficiency and impact. We are working closely with our technology partners in building an AI-based platform that is not only a one-stop repository for all the sonic assets of a brand but can also help in creating and adapting existing sonic assets to serve a plethora of content requirement needs,” he explains. BrandMusiq is also exploring experiential ideas using sound and studying UI, UX and the role of sounds in enhancing consumer experience. It is focusing on expanding its offerings to include comprehensive audio strategies that cover all ear points — in-store, online and on-ground experiences — ensuring a consistent and impactful sonic presence. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on sonic branding BrandMusiq AI social media sound marketing artificial intelligence brands jingles audio branding consumer attention (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "Wahter has a mobile app through which advertisers can share their brand designs. They can also add features such as QR codes and discount coupons on bottles’ labels. Shiva Group of Industries looked at two objectives when it got into the water business — provide drinking water at an affordable price and use the product as a vehicle for marketing too. With the mercury soaring in Delhi-NCR now, their efforts stand to fulfil these objectives in the region. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Kashiish A Nenwani and Amitt Nenwani, directors at Delhi-based petrochemical firm Shiva Group of Industries, got into the drinking water business in January by launching bottled water under the brand of Wahter . The 250 ml bottle is priced at Re 1. About 80% of the label space on the bottle is empty; advertisers can put their names and brands here for a price, say the husband-wife duo. “We recognised the power of advertising and saw an opportunity to integrate brand advertisements into our water bottles, making them affordable for all. This approach allows us to keep our prices remarkably low while still ensuring the sustainability of our operations,” said Amitt Nenwani. As per a January 2023 report by GreyViews Research , the bottled water market size in India was valued at $22.72 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $36.21 billion by 2030. Wahter has a mobile app through which advertisers can share their brand designs. They can also add features such as QR codes and discount coupons on bottles’ labels. Nenwani says their serviceable areas include offices and kiosks across Delhi-NCR. Their distribution strategy includes placing their products in stores that see high footfalls, such as Delhi Metro stations, India Gate and Kartavya Path. Within just a month of its launch across the Delhi NCR, Wahter bottles have reached more than 100 carts and kiosks in the region. The product should get a boost with the capital seeing record-high temperatures. The company claims to have sold 2 lakh bottles within a month of the launch. “To streamline logistics, we have partnered with ISI-certified bottling plants approximately every 75 km, ensuring efficient distribution and minimising transportation challenges,” Nenwani says. Brands such as boAt , Vijay Sales and ACE Capitals have put their ads on Wahter bottles. This marketing platform faces a challenge — that of the label being removed. The company claims to have employed an adhesive technology that ensures the labels remain securely attached to the bottle. “Additionally, the material used to make the labels is designed to not become loose when it comes in contact with water, unlike other bottles. This ensures that our labels remain intact and effective, regardless of the conditions,” Nenwani adds. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Wahter advertising marketing bottled water affordable price branding Shiva Group of Industries petrochemical firm label space (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "iStock Corporate governance pertains to the system of regulations, customs, and procedures governing the direction and oversight of an entity. Corporate governance, the set of practices that ensure transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct within organizations, is the bedrock of a robust business environment. In India , where businesses thrive in a diverse and dynamic landscape, the importance of sound corporate governance cannot be overstated. In recent years, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) has emerged as a vital instrument in advancing corporate governance practices in the country. This article delves into the dynamic relationship between corporate governance and IBC , highlighting how the latter has played a transformative role in building a better boardroom in India. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Understanding Corporate Governance Before delving into the role of IBC, it is essential to understand what corporate governance entails. Corporate governance pertains to the system of regulations, customs, and procedures governing the direction and oversight of an entity. In case of a company, it involves a delicate balance of power and responsibility between a company's board of directors, management, shareholders, other stakeholders and the regulators. The fundamental goal of corporate governance is to ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are safeguarded, and corporate objectives are met efficiently and ethically. The OECD Principles of Corporate Governance (“OECD Principles”), established in 1999, have become a global reference for countries w.r.t corporate governance practices. These principles emphasize the vital role of good corporate governance in supporting economic strength and stability worldwide. The OECD Principles serve as the international standard for corporate governance, guiding reform efforts by governments and the private sector. The OECD Principles emphasize that the entitlements of stakeholders are predominantly defined by legal statutes (e.g., labor, business, commercial, environmental, and insolvency laws) or through contractual agreements that companies are obliged to honor. Taking a closer look, the OECD Principles also stress the importance of an effective insolvency framework and the enforcement of creditor rights to complement the corporate governance framework. Enactment of IBC IBC enacted in 2016, is a landmark piece of legislation. Its primary objective is to consolidate and amend laws relating to reorganisation and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time bound manner for maximisation of value of assets of such persons, to promote entrepreneurship, availability of credit and balance the interests of all the stakeholders. The IBC introduced a comprehensive framework for the resolution of distressed companies, promoting transparency and accountability. It replaced the existing, often cumbersome, and time-consuming insolvency laws with a more streamlined process. The Impact of IBC on Corporate Governance in India IBC’s impact on corporate governance in India has been substantial. The Supreme Court in the matter of Lalit Kumar Jain v. Union of India & Ors. [TRANSFERRED CASE (CIVIL) NO. 245/2020] also observed the following while acknowledging that IBC aims at promoting corporate governance: “The highlight of the Code is the institutional framework it envisions. This framework consists of the regulator (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India) insolvency professionals, information utilities and adjudicatory mechanisms (NCLT and National Company Law Appellate Tribunal-NCLAT). These institutions and structures are aimed at promoting corporate governance and also enable a time bound and formal resolution of insolvency.” Further, the Supreme Court in the matter of Arun Kumar Jagatramka v. Jindal Steel And Power Ltd [Civil Appeal No. 9664 of 2019] observed the following: “A timely resolution of corporate insolvency was conceived as an instrument to support the development of credit markets, encourage entrepreneurship, enhance the ease of doing business and provide an environment conducive to investment, setting the economy on the path to growth and development. “ It was further observed: “The enactment of the IBC has marked a quantum change in corporate governance and the rule of law. First and foremost, the IBC perceives good corporate governance, respect for and adherence to the rule of law as central to the resolution of corporate insolvencies. Second, the IBC perceives corporate insolvency not as an isolated problem faced by an individual business entities but places it in the context of a framework which is founded on public interest in facilitating economic growth by balancing diverse stakeholder interests. Third, the IBC attributes a primacy to the business decisions taken by creditors acting as a collective body, on the premise that the timely resolution of corporate insolvency is necessary to ensure the growth of credit markets and encourage investment. Fourth, in its diverse provisions, the IBC ensures that the interests of corporate enterprises are not conflated with the interests of their promoters; the economic value of corporate structures is broader in content than the partisan interests of their managements. These salutary objectives of the IBC can be achieved if the integrity of the resolution process is placed at the forefront. Primarily, the IBC is a legislation aimed at re-organization and resolution of insolvencies. Liquidation is a matter of last resort. These objectives can be achieved only through a purposive interpretation which requires courts, while infusing meaning and content to its provisions, to ensure that the problems which beset the earlier regime do not enter through the backdoor through disingenuous stratagems.” Hence the judicial forum have recognized the importance of IBC in promoting good corporate governance. Here are some key aspects of the transformation brought about by IBC: Enhancing Creditor Rights One of the critical aspects of corporate governance is the protection of the rights of all stakeholders. IBC has reinforced this by prioritizing the interests of creditors, which includes financial institutions, bondholders, and operational creditors. IBC plays a crucial role in balancing the interest of all the creditors. The appointment of the resolution professional and constitution of the Committee of Creditors (“CoC”) in accordance with the provisions of IBC to monitor and govern the resolution process and for the CoC to oversee the tasks of the resolution professional so appointed, including operations of the corporate debtor as a going concern are crucial milestones towards good corporate governance. The major task with which the CoC is entrusted with, is the approval of the most viable resolution plan out of the resolution plans submitted for the corporate debtor. In deciding the successful resolution plan, the CoC not only has to identify as to which plan is able to extract the maximum value of the assets of the corporate debtor and also which plan is able to provide the fairest payment structure to all the creditors but also which plan will be able to reorganize the assets of the Corporate Debtor, which is also one of the main objectives of IBC. Creditor rights are a critical aspect of corporate governance. The IBC prioritizes creditor interests, balancing the rights of various creditors and reinforcing the idea that creditors are respected. This promotes good corporate governance, as companies understand their financial responsibilities better. Promoting Transparency Transparency is a foundation of effective corporate governance. IBC provides for a transparent resolution process of a corporate debtor wherein the resolution professional is obligated to investigate whether a corporate debtor has engaged in avoidance transactions, including preferential transactions, undervalued transactions, extortionate credit transactions, fraudulent trading, and wrongful trading and provide his/her opinion about the same vide Form CIRP 8. Furthermore, the insolvency professional is obligated to provide specific disclosures upon assuming his/her role (whether as an interim resolution professional, resolution professional, or liquidator), which are imperative to ensure transparency and to establish their independence and impartiality. This transparency ensures that shareholders, creditors, and the public have access to critical information regarding the financial health of companies and the actions taken by the insolvency professionals. This, in turn, fosters trust in the system. Promoting Accountability Accountability is another crucial pillar to good corporate governance. The extant corporate laws highlight the importance of appointment of independent directors on the Board of Directors of the Company and their crucial function in guaranteeing that companies operate in the utmost interests of all stakeholders. Further, under IBC, the corporate debtor's board of directors is often replaced by insolvency professionals during the resolution process. This change not only streamlines the decision-making process but also holds corporate leaders accountable for their actions. Concerns about relinquishing control over their organizations have compelled boards and management teams to adopt a more prudent approach, exercising greater responsibility, and steering clear of circumstances that could potentially result in insolvency. IBC and the accompanying regulations unequivocally illustrate the integration of transparency and accountability standards, underscoring their fundamental role in ensuring IBC's effectiveness. Relationship between IBC and corporate governance in India has yielded several benefits, wherein improved governance practices have boosted investor confidence and created a healthier business ecosystem. IBC has significantly contributed to enhancing corporate governance by safeguarding continuity and preserving value for stakeholders. Moreover, it has played an essential role in recognizing and respecting the rights and claims of a wide array of stakeholders, including employees, vendors, and operational creditors, alongside financial creditors. Conclusion Corporate governance and IBC are interwoven forces in India's business landscape. IBC has played a pivotal role in advancing corporate governance by promoting accountability, transparency, and the protection of stakeholders' rights. As India's corporate sector continues to evolve, IBC’s influence promises to build even better boardrooms, where ethical conduct and responsible decision-making are paramount. The path to a thriving and transparent corporate environment in India is illuminated by the essential partnership between corporate governance and IBC.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has emerged as a pivotal tool in India's quest to bolster its attractiveness to global investors . By streamlining the process of resolving insolvency cases , the IBC not only facilitates the efficient allocation of capital but also instils confidence in investors regarding the robustness of India's legal and regulatory framework. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} The Supreme Court recently noted that the principle aims of the IBC are to promote investment, and resolution of insolvencies of corporate persons, firms, and individuals in a time bound manner. The IBC consolidated and amended a web of laws which had led to an ineffective and inefficient mechanism for resolution of insolvencies marked with significant delays. One of the key aspects that enhances India's global appeal is the IBC's provision for cross-border insolvency cases. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code contains provisions enabling cross-border insolvency cases through bilateral agreements and the issuance of letters of request to foreign courts by Adjudicating Authorities (AAs) under section 234 and section 235. Through bilateral agreements and the issuance of letters of request to foreign courts, the IBC enables seamless resolution of insolvency cases involving international stakeholders. This aspect is particularly significant in today's interconnected global economy, where businesses operate across borders, and investment flows transcend geographical boundaries. Moreover, the adoption of the UNCITRAL Model Law, with necessary modifications to suit the Indian context, further strengthens India's position as an attractive investment destination. The Model Law provides a well-established legal framework for handling cross-border insolvency issues, offering clarity and predictability to investors and creditors alike. By aligning with international best practices, India demonstrates its commitment to creating a conducive environment for investment and fostering economic growth. Pertinently, National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in Jet Airways case while dealing with the issue that when separate ‘Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process’/ liquidation proceedings have been initiated against same ‘Corporate Debtor’ one in India and another in Netherland (North Holland), whether by a Joint Agreement or understanding between the ‘Resolution Professional’ of ‘Corporate Debtor’ in India and Administrator in Holland (Netherland) one proceeding in India can proceed for maximization of the asset of the ‘Corporate Debtor’ and balancing all the stake holders, including the Indian/Offshore Creditors/ Lenders. was successful in implementing cooperation between the Bankruptcy Administrator and Resolution Professional, granting the Bankruptcy Administrator permission to attend committee of creditors meetings solely as an observer. A cross-border insolvency protocol was developed by the Resolution Professional and the Bankruptcy Administrator, incorporating the principles of the Model Law. Furthermore, the effective implementation of the IBC enhances legal certainty and transparency, which are paramount for attracting foreign investment. Investors seek assurance that their rights will be protected and enforced in a timely and efficient manner. The IBC's emphasis on time-bound resolution processes and the protection of creditors' interests contributes to building trust and confidence in India's insolvency regime. In addition to facilitating investment inflows, the IBC plays a crucial role in revitalizing distressed businesses and preserving economic value. By providing a mechanism for the orderly resolution of insolvency cases, the IBC encourages entrepreneurship and risk-taking while ensuring accountability and responsibility in corporate governance. In conclusion, leveraging the IBC to enhance India's global appeal requires a concerted effort to strengthen its implementation, improve institutional capacity, and promote awareness among stakeholders. By capitalizing on the IBC's potential to unlock investment opportunities and foster economic resilience, India can position itself as a preferred destination for international investors seeking growth and diversification.

In a conversation with ET Digital, Manoj Kumar Singh, Counsel at S&A Law Offices talks about the possible amendments to the Bankruptcy Code, why businesses should look at alternative dispute resolution and the role of technology. Edited excerpts. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Economic Times (ET): Technology has touched every sector. What is the outlook for the legal sector in 2024? What is the impact of technology? Manoj Kumar Singh (MKS): The legal sector is on the cusp of transformative change, largely driven by technological innovation and evolving client expectations. The adoption of AI for tasks such as legal research and predictive analytics will not only enhance efficiency but also fundamentally alter the landscape of legal services delivery. Virtual platforms for hearings and dispute resolution are becoming the norm, heralding a new era of accessibility and convenience in legal processes. Simultaneously, the legal sector is witnessing a pivotal shift towards diversity and inclusion, not just as a moral imperative but as a strategic asset in attracting talent and clients. The growing popularity of alternative dispute resolution methods highlights a global trend towards less adversarial, more collaborative forms of justice. For legal professionals, the challenge lies in harnessing these advancements to deliver personalized, efficient, and accessible services, all while navigating the complexities of an increasingly globalized and regulated world. The technological revolution is reshaping the practice of law, particularly in the realms of dispute resolution and commercial litigation. E-filing and online case management systems are streamlining what were once cumbersome processes, reducing paperwork and enhancing the ability to track case progress. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of virtual courts and video conferencing, showcasing the potential for these technologies to save time and reduce costs while maintaining judicial processes. Artificial intelligence is playing a pivotal role, from automating legal research to providing predictive insights on case outcomes, enabling lawyers to make more informed decisions. Furthermore, online dispute resolution platforms are emerging as a convenient, efficient alternative to traditional courtroom battles. Even in the indirect tax sphere, we see a huge shift towards technology leading to a less cumbersome compliance ecosystem. Amidst these advancements, the legal sector must also navigate new challenges, including ensuring data privacy, addressing cybersecurity threats, and upholding the ethical use of AI. As we embrace these innovations, the imperative to balance technological opportunities with ethical responsibilities becomes increasingly critical. ET: The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has been around for a while. What are the amendments and changes that we can see? MKS: With the evolving landscape of business and finance, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is anticipated to undergo significant amendments aimed at enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the insolvency resolution process. Among the expected changes, the introduction of a pre-packaged insolvency resolution process stands out as a promising development, offering a quicker and more streamlined approach for restructuring distressed businesses. Amendments are also likely to clarify the positions and priorities of financial creditors, addressing current ambiguities and ensuring a fair and equitable resolution process. Another critical area of focus is the enhancement of the cross-border insolvency framework, which is essential for handling insolvencies involving multinational corporations with operations across different legal jurisdictions. These amendments will likely result in a more robust and transparent insolvency process, providing greater clarity and confidence to investors, creditors, and businesses alike. By streamlining the resolution process and enhancing legal certainty, these changes are poised to make the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code a more effective tool for managing business distress and facilitating economic recovery. ET: In an interconnected world, businesses work on a global level. What are the trends you are seeing when it comes to cross-border disputes ? MKS: The landscape of cross-border financial and investment disputes is becoming increasingly complex, reflecting the intertwined nature of today’s global economy. The shift towards international arbitration as the preferred method for resolving such disputes highlights its benefits in terms of flexibility, neutrality, and the enforceability of awards across jurisdictions. However, this trend also brings to the fore certain challenges associated with regulatory changes, enforcement of judgments, and the rising incidence of investor-state disputes. Companies must traverse these complexities by undertaking comprehensive risk assessments, crafting clear and enforceable contracts, and staying informed of regulatory developments across jurisdictions. Engaging with experienced legal counsel familiar with the nuances of cross-border litigation and arbitration is crucial. Moreover, adopting a proactive stance on cybersecurity and data protection can safeguard against emerging threats in the digital domain. By taking these steps, companies can better prepare for and mitigate the risks associated with cross-border financial and investment disputes, ensuring they are well-positioned to protect their interests in an increasingly interconnected world. ET: Getting a dispute settled in courts in time consuming and costly. How can companies leverage ADR mechanisms? MKS: To effectively leverage alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms, businesses must adopt a strategic and informed approach. Awareness and education about ADR processes among key stakeholders can foster a culture that values negotiation and mediation as viable alternatives to litigation. Including ADR clauses in commercial contracts is a critical step, requiring careful consideration of the most appropriate methods and settings for resolving potential disputes. When selecting an ADR mechanism, companies should consider the nature of the dispute, the relationship between the parties, and the desired outcomes, ensuring a fit-for-purpose approach. Engaging with experienced and impartial ADR professionals is vital for ensuring that the process is conducted fairly and effectively. Moreover, companies should prioritize the timely resolution of disputes and remain open to settlement discussions throughout the ADR process. Emphasizing the confidentiality of ADR proceedings can also reassure parties concerned about the potential exposure of sensitive information. Ultimately, a proactive and strategic use of ADR can enable businesses to resolve disputes efficiently, maintain business relationships, and minimize disruption and costs. ET: With litigations rising, what are challenges for the legal sector? MKS: The Indian legal sector is grappling with a myriad of challenges, including a significant backlog of cases, inadequate infrastructure, and the need for technological upgrades. Addressing these issues demands a comprehensive strategy that leverages technology to enhance efficiency and accessibility in the legal process. Capacity building through training and skill development is essential for equipping legal professionals to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving legal landscape. Promoting alternative dispute resolution mechanisms can help alleviate the burden on the courts and provide faster, more amicable dispute resolution options. The establishment of specialized courts and forums for specific types of disputes has shown promise in expediting the resolution process and should be expanded. Moreover, enhancing legal aid services and simplifying legal procedures can improve access to justice, particularly for marginalized populations. Collaboration across the legal ecosystem is crucial for sharing knowledge, best practices, and resources, fostering a more cohesive and efficient legal sector. By embracing these strategies, the Indian legal sector can overcome its current challenges and better serve the needs of a dynamic and diverse society. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on legal disputes S&A Law legal ADR (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "iStock Online dispute resolution (ODR) is fast emerging as the tech-savvy way of achieving seamless out-of-court dispute resolution with quick turnaround time. The digital era demands digitalized solutions for complex consumer problems to ensure smooth compliance with legal formalities. Online dispute resolution (ODR) is fast emerging as the tech-savvy way of achieving seamless out-of-court dispute resolution with quick turnaround time. The introduction of eADR, which refers to the use of technology in alternative dispute resolution processes, is helping millions of consumers deal with their disputes online. Advancing Artificial Intelligence, trained on diverse data sets, is redefining the dispute resolution process with algorithms in place to mine previous data and present optimal solutions for legal issues. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Over the past few years, new tools have been introduced to the online dispute resolution process, offering a safe, fast, and impartial approach to settle conflicts with a multitude of services like mediation, negotiation, and arbitration. Since it aligns with the fast-paced nature of start-ups, business-to-consumer ( B2C ) tech-enabled start-ups can leverage ODR to expedite their legal processes and resolve issues efficiently. Challenges specific to B2C start-ups Effective customer retention is a key performance metric for B2C companies. Having a robust tech-enabled grievance and dispute resolution mechanism, which is consistent and reliable, inspires customer confidence and wins their loyalty. Since the customer base of a B2C set-up is quite diverse, their requirements are just as varied, and supply chains must demonstrate the resilience and flexibility to effectively manage consumer demands. However, with the invariably increasing volume of complaints as the business scales further, it becomes imperative for organizations to enable smoother dispute redressal. The lack of proper consumer grievance redressal mechanisms and disagreements between parties involved often ends up in a legal dispute. In the post-pandemic world, most businesses are dealing in online payments which increases their vulnerability to cyberattacks. Since they would want to ensure continued patronage, businesses must go the extra mile when it comes to securing their payment gateways against potential attacks or data leakage. If such situations do arise, the organization will benefit from being well-prepared to mitigate the legal fallout and address resulting disputes to their customer’s satisfaction. Large volumes of contracts can present a huge challenge for start-ups still in nascent stages of establishment. To avoid future conflict and disputes, companies must ensure meticulousness. Optimizing ODR Client satisfaction is of utmost importance in today’s competitive business landscape. ODR can prove to be a key differentiator when it comes to effective dispute resolution. However, to encourage more customers to opt for it, organizations will have to provide proactive assistance. Since the process can be difficult to navigate for those without legal acumen, start-ups can offer the help of their team of relevant professionals to advise and assist customers. ODR platforms are designed to ensure optimum privacy, but organizations will be well-advised to conduct regular checks to ascertain that highest levels of security are being maintained to protect their customer data. Additionally, implementing robust data processing and cybersecurity measures in place will help keep the dispute resolution process transparent and confidential. ODR mechanisms can be tailored to match the peculiarities of contracts, to ensure that the resolution process aligns with the dynamic and innovative nature of tech start-ups. How ODR benefits tech enabled B2C start-ups: Time and cost efficiency Traditional legal proceedings can be expensive and cumbersome. ODR minimises costs associated with travel, physical hearings, paperwork enabling start-ups to allocate resources wisely. It also prevents prolonged distractions that come with dealing with the nuances of the dispute, allowing them to focus on core operations instead. Adaptability to tech issues ODR platforms are equipped to effectively handle disputes arising from technology-related matters, offering specialised expertise in navigating intricate technical disagreements. User-friendly interface ODR platforms are designed with user-friendly interface, making it easier for tech-savvy stakeholders and their consumers to navigate the dispute resolution process seamlessly. Documentation and transparency The ODR processes generates digital records, which enhances transparency and accountability. In a booming B2C market marked by technological advancements, productive growth is directly proportional to the risks involved. New age start-ups must continuously manoeuvre their way through diverse demographics, while ensuring sustainability and mitigating cybersecurity risks. In such a scenario, dispute redressal requires efficient digital approach using innovative technology and ODR becomes a powerful tool to coax involved parties in alternative dispute resolution methods, leading to quicker dispensation of resolution.

    "article_content": "iStock IPs are creations of the mind and key IPs include trade marks, copyrights, and patents. Social media platforms have transformed the way people communicate, connect, and share information. While social media has created immense opportunities for engagement and expression, it has also raised a myriad of legal challenges, particularly concerning intellectual property (IP) rights including issues around content ownership , digital rights management, deep fakes etc. It, therefore, becomes important to understand these challenges and strive to achieve a balance between social media and the IP rights . Broadly, IPs are creations of the mind and key IPs include trade marks, copyrights, and patents. Trade marks are essentially brand names that identify one business from another. Copyrights are creative works that include literary content, music recordings, films etc. Patents protect inventions. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Increasing social media role and IP rights. Virtually all social media content, whether a post uploaded on ‘X’ or a picture on Instagram or a video on YouTube, involves IP creation and use. From an IP point of view, one of the key issues to understand is “Who owns such uploaded content”? Undoubtedly, social media platforms offer a dynamic and engaging platform to users and content creators to express themselves and share content with the public and their followers. However, such opportunities for expression are not unfettered and are bound by laws and regulations, including IP considerations. The broad thumb-rule is that if a user has created their own original content (whether a post, song, or video or otherwise), they own the IP rights in that content. Almost all social media platforms clearly recognise these “user generated content” as belonging to the user. However, if the user uses third party owned content, without the permission of or license from, in their uploaded content, it can lead to issues of IP infringement - potentially, therefore, actionable under law. While IP laws do provide for some exceptions that protect against an infringement claim, the uploading and posting of content belonging to third parties remains a major concern to IP concerns. Examples of some such major concerns include piracy of movies through telegram channels, use of unlicensed music in videos, etc. While monitoring and checking each and every upload on social media platforms raises immense logistical, financial, and infrastructural implications, Courts and, indeed IP laws, have taken proactive measures to try and ensure IP rights are respected and protected across social media. In fact, social media platforms are increasingly having to play, and are playing a more active role in helping IP owners and authorities enforce IP rights over their platforms. With the increasing influence of artificial intelligence , there are new types of IP concerns arising through social media platforms. The ability to create deepfakes or alter the voices of artists to create songs provides a real threat to IP rights. While deepfakes, for example, does violate privacy rights, they can also tantamount to violating a personality right of a celebrity, thereby creating a claim under trade mark law. Similarly, distorting the voice of a person, especially a music artist, to create a song that was not actually sung by the artists, raises copyright concerns. These are real and growing threats to IP owners. As a reaction, we are seeing celebrities taking out omnibus injunctions to protect against misuse of their likeness, which would also extend to misuse over social media platforms. As steps ahead, while Courts and lawmakers are dealing with these issues and concerns at an enforcement and regulatory level, users can, and should, acquaint themselves with the terms of use of social media platforms in terms of dos and don’ts. Since all social media platforms have mechanisms to report IP infringement and threat, IP owners do certainly need support from users and content creators to ensure that hard earned IP rights are not diluted or misused. A collective effort to deal with these concerns is needed.

    "article_content": "iStock In 2023, India's gaming ecosystem reached 500 million active gamers, with 200 million ready to invest in enhancing their experiences. The global gaming industry is currently at an inflexion point, having evolved to a worth of $184 billion through decades of technological advancements, distribution enhancements, and innovative business models. With the advent of cutting-edge technologies such as Gen AI, cloud gaming, 5G, and XR, the industry is growing rapidly. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} In tandem with this global trend, India's gaming ecosystem is also witnessing remarkable growth. In 2023, it reached 500 million active gamers, with 200 million ready to invest in enhancing their experiences. This equates to over 50% of smartphone users playing games, a substantial portion of whom are willing to make in-game purchases. However, despite its success, the gaming sector still needs to exhibit more within the ecosystem in terms of domestic studios, AI infrastructure, and gamification tools. These gaps present untapped opportunities for new-age companies. Following a comprehensive analysis of gaming trends worldwide, Eximius Ventures has identified specific areas with potential for emerging companies from India to capitalise on. Domestic Studios The Indian gaming landscape is witnessing significant growth, yet the content available often feels disconnected from the local sociocultural context. However, the boom in Indian gamers has attracted foreign developers to establish studios in the country, paving the way for veterans from these studios to potentially create gaming experiences that resonate more with Indian audiences. Currently, out of the top 10 highest revenue-generating games in India, only one, Teen Patti , is developed by an Indian studio, signalling the potential for local studios to adopt global best practices and succeed in the Indian market. Additionally, there's a noticeable shift in Indian gamer preferences, with casual and hyper-casual games dominating the market, while mid-core and hardcore games are gaining traction, boasting higher ARPPUs. As India continues to export its culture and content across various mediums, gaming emerges as the next frontier. With globally acclaimed Indian titles like Raji - An Ancient Epic, Asura, and Rainswept setting precedents, Indian studios are poised for further success on the global stage. Moreover, the buoyant period in Indian cinema, with movies like Dangal, Secret Superstar, and Baahubali 2 enjoying widespread acceptance, opens doors for developers to not only cater to the Indian market but also expand their reach internationally. Publisher Ecosystem As the developer ecosystem in India strengthens, there is also a growing need for a greater presence of domestic publishers, similar to ecosystems in the USA and China, where domestic publishers dominate customer spending. Despite India's substantial developer community, Indian publishers command only 6% of the local mobile market, indicating the necessity for stronger domestic publishing. The global publisher market has witnessed significant outcomes, with players like Voodoo (France), Say Games (Cyprus), and Lion Studios (USA), with Rollic (Istanbul) building a thriving outcome. Additionally, while the majority of the market is focused on casual and hyper-casual games, there are opportunities for mid-core and hardcore games, particularly for Indian publishers with specialised knowledge. Notable Indian examples such as Glance and Jio Games have shown impressive growth, albeit with a focus on generic platforms. This suggests the potential for specialisation within specific sectors, signalling opportunities for further growth and diversification in the Indian gaming industry. Infrastructure The rapid technology growth in game development has exacerbated the resource demands, widening the gap between large studios and smaller developers. Despite this gap, the advent of generative AI promises to be a better playing field. Indie studios, operating with limited resources, demonstrate agility in game development. Nearly half complete prototyping within a month, and 62% finalise development within a year. To sustain this, they leverage technology, especially AI, to streamline development and enhance user-generated content (UGC) and live operations. UGC emerged as a key gaming trend, driving major developers to integrate engaging mechanics for viral growth. The fusion of UGC and AI is expected to produce tools that expedite development, simplify UGC creation, and streamline game lifecycle management, offering significant innovation opportunities in areas like world creation, AI behaviour mapping, live operations, creator tools, and AI-driven user acquisition. Gamification Gamification integrates traditional game design elements into non-gaming platforms to enhance user experience, significantly improving user retention and engagement. The global gamification market is growing rapidly, with a 27.4% CAGR expected from 2020 to 2025. Currently, 70% of Global 2000 businesses have adopted gamification. In retail, it has led to a 700% increase in customer acquisitions and can boost user engagement by 48% and customer retention by 22%. Additionally, implementing gamification in sales processes results in a 25.3% increase in sales conversion. As consumer-facing brands like Amazon, Flipkart, and Starbucks utilise gamification to enhance their operations, there's a growing trend among new-age companies across Fintech, Commerce, and Health to develop similar solutions. This presents an opportunity for companies to assist in creating these platforms and capitalise on the expanding gamification market. In conclusion, emerging trends like publisher ecosystem, infrastructure development, and gamification offer fertile ground for investment in the gaming industry. With India's burgeoning gaming market and global trends gaining momentum, investments in these areas can pave the way for sustained growth and enduring success in the dynamic realm of online media & gaming.

    "article_content": "ETTelecom Generative AI represents a significant leap forward. Remember those early days of chatbots? Clunky, repetitive conversations that left you feeling more like you were interacting with a broken record than a helpful assistant. Well, those days are behind us. The limitations of these basic chatbots are becoming a thing of the past as a new generation of AI agents powered by generative AI and automation take center stage. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Generative AI represents a significant leap forward. Imagine an AI that can not only understand your questions but also respond in a way that's natural, engaging, and even creative. This, coupled with the power of automation, promises to revolutionize the way we interact with technology in profound ways. But there's more to it than just answering questions. The future of AI interaction lies in the ability of these agents to serve not merely as conversational partners but as comprehensive guides and copilots. They're evolving to become digital helpers that can navigate users through complex processes, automate tedious tasks, and offer hands-on guidance in real-time. This means that AI agents are not only getting better at understanding us but also at taking actions on our behalf, making our interactions with digital platforms smoother and more intuitive. But before we explore the world of AI agents and how they're poised to transform everything from customer service to the way we access information, let’s take a moment to understand why those earlier chatbots are being left behind. Navigating the complex labyrinth of customer service portals can often feel like being lost in a maze, especially when your only guide is a traditional chatbot. These bots, with their pre-programmed responses and inability to understand the nuances of human inquiry, have long been a source of frustration. They seem to assume that every user arrives with a clear understanding of their problem and the exact service they require. Yet, the reality couldn't be further from this assumption. More often than not, customers find themselves unsure of the specific service or solution they need, longing instead for a conversation that mirrors the fluidity and understanding of a human interaction. This craving for a more natural dialogue reflects a broader expectation among users today. Whether they're navigating banking, insurance, healthcare , or government applications, the desire is for AI to not just respond, but to understand, guide, and assist in a context that feels personal and relevant to their situation. Traditional chatbots, with their narrow focus on predefined queries, fall short of meeting these expectations, leaving users feeling unheard and underserved. AI agents are designed to bridge the gap between the static, one-dimensional chatbots of yesteryear and the dynamic, intuitive digital assistants’ users dream of. Unlike their predecessors, AI agents engage with users in a natural language, providing contextual information and guiding them through processes step-by-step. Imagine an AI coach, available 24/7, capable of walking a user through resolving an issue on their insurance app or explaining how to utilize a new service on their banking portal, all in a conversation that feels as natural as talking to a friend. Such AI agents represent a significant leap forward in digital customer service, transforming the landscape of self-service platforms. They don't just respond to queries; they anticipate needs, offer solutions, and guide users through to resolution, embodying the proactive and knowledgeable assistant that was previously missing. This shift not only enhances the user experience but also alleviates the workload on customer support staff, creating a more efficient and satisfying interaction for everyone involved. In this landscape of innovation, tools like Microsoft Copilot for employees, Adobe Copilot for marketers, and Supervity AI coach exemplify the diverse applications of AI agents. Each acts as a digital copilot, demonstrating the adaptability and impact of this technology across various sectors. From streamlining workplace tasks to optimizing marketing strategies and enhancing customer support, these AI agents are pivotal in redefining what digital assistance can achieve, setting new standards for user interaction and satisfaction. The generative AI era Generative AI is a game-changer. This branch of AI is capable of handling enormous volumes of data to produce prose that is human-like, translate languages, and even produce various forms of artistic material. AI agents are now able to have more natural, engaging, and educational exchanges thanks to their increased fluency. Transforming customer interaction Imagine a customer support representative who is able to relate to your irritation, provide thorough answers to your inquiries, and even make recommendations for solutions you hadn't thought of. This represents AI agents' potential. Over time, they will learn and adapt to answer common questions, troubleshoot issues, and personalise encounters. Here are a few examples to understand the customer interaction transformation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): They allow human agents to handle more difficult situations by providing instantaneous answers to frequently asked questions. Troubleshooting: AI agents can identify and fix a variety of issues using sophisticated algorithms, frequently, more quickly than a human could. Personalised interactions: AI agents are able to customise their responses to meet your unique demands by examining your previous interactions and preferences. Constant Learning: AI agents are always picking up new skills and changing as a result of interactions with humans. This indicates that as time goes on, they get more adept at recognising your needs and offering beneficial answers. Digital adoption copilot : AI agents now serve as digital adoption copilots, changing the way users interact with digital platforms by guiding users through the intricacies of digital portals and applications, all while answering questions in the user's native language. This approach is a significant step up from the static chatbots of the past, which relied on users to initiate interactions with specific queries. Instead of waiting passively, these AI agents proactively offer assistance, ensuring users can navigate digital environments with ease and efficiency. Automation on autopilot Automation combined with generative AI opens up new possibilities for efficiency. AI agents have the ability to automate routine jobs, freeing up human customer support agents to handle more complicated problems. This not only shortens wait times but also enables companies to save costs. The path ahead Although AI agents present fascinating opportunities, difficulties still exist. Crucial components of development include protecting data security, avoiding bias in AI systems, and building confidence in these virtual assistants. The future is now The days of chatbots, as we know, are coming to an end. A new era of intelligent and interactive technology is being ushered in by AI agents, which are driven by automation and generative AI. The way we communicate with companies, obtain information, and move around the digital world will undoubtedly change as this technology develops.

Generative AI, with its transformative potential across industries , is poised to be the defining technology of the next Industrial Revolution. For CEOs , the stakes are undeniably high. Business as usual is no longer an option. Leaders who embrace Generative AI with a clear vision and a commitment to responsible implementation will unlock a future brimming with opportunity, propelling their organizations to new levels of innovation and efficiency . Conversely, those who fail to recognize its potential, risk falling behind competitors who leverage this technology to disrupt entire industries. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} This critical juncture demands more than just an understanding of Generative AI. It necessitates a proactive approach from leadership . CEOs & CIOs must actively chart a course for its responsible and impactful integration within our firms. It's time to move beyond simply keeping pace with the times – it's about shaping the future of our industries with Generative AI. Unlocking Business Value In a short span, Generative AI has proven that its impact is wide-reaching, with the power to fundamentally alter how industries approach everything from revenue growth to product development, customer service and even employee’s productivity. Today, pharmaceutical companies are utilizing generative models to design new drugs with lightning speed, tailoring treatments to specific patient needs. AI is creating innovative materials and product prototypes, accelerating the design cycle, and fostering a constant stream of fresh ideas. Even in the realm of Finance, Gen AI is generating personalized investment portfolios with unmatched granularity and supporting manufacturing firms to optimize in real-time, leading to increased efficiency and reduced waste. These are just a few glimpses, and the key to the future lies in harnessing the creative potential of Gen AI. Having established Generative AI's transformative power, it's clear that this technology isn't just a \"nice to have\" for CEOs – it's a strategic imperative. Leading your organization into the Generative AI era requires a deliberate and well-defined plan. Here are some key steps CEOs can take to navigate this transformative landscape and unlock the immense potential of Generative AI. Equipping Leaders for the AI Era: A CEO's Toolkit The first step in any CEO's Generative AI journey is a mindset shift. Move beyond viewing AI solely as an automation tool for replacing tasks. Generative AI's true power lies in augmenting human capabilities. Imagine AI-powered design tools that spark creative leaps, or marketing platforms that craft hyper-personalized campaigns with human-like intuition and AI-powered assistants that can answer employee questions and streamline workflows. By fostering this collaborative approach, CEOs unlock a future where humans and AI work in tandem to achieve extraordinary results. Now, let's bridge the gap between theory and practice. Generative AI offers a treasure trove of business value for CEOs. Executives can expect to see significant efficiency improvements, with AI handling repetitive tasks and freeing up valuable human time for strategic endeavours. Product development cycles shrink as AI accelerates the design and prototyping process. Customer experiences become hyper-personalized, leading to increased satisfaction and loyalty. Employees benefit too, with AI streamlining workflows and empowering them to focus on higher-order thinking. Furthermore, generative models can analyse vast amounts of data, uncovering valuable insights that would be impossible to glean through traditional methods. From Vision to Action So, how do CEOs translate this potential into reality? The roadmap begins with identifying concrete use cases. Where can AI best augment your existing processes and unlock new opportunities? Start with a pilot project, a manageable experiment that allows you to test the waters and refine your approach. Establish clear metrics to measure success, defining the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will demonstrate AI's impact. The decision to buy a pre-built Generative AI solution or build your own depends on factors like your company's technical expertise, budget, and specific needs. Whichever path you choose, careful consideration of technical and operational aspects is paramount. Ensure your infrastructure can handle the demands of AI and build a team with the necessary skills to manage and integrate the technology seamlessly. By following these steps, CEOs can equip themselves with the essential tools to navigate the Generative AI era and unlock a future of transformative growth. Steering a Responsible Course The Generative AI revolution must be guided by a strong ethical compass. Bias, a persistent challenge in AI, can creep into Generative models if trained on skewed datasets. This can lead to discriminatory outcomes, undermining trust and brand reputation. To combat bias, CEOs must prioritize diverse and high-quality data for training. Partnering with data science experts to audit datasets for hidden biases is crucial. Another hurdle is the \"black box\" nature of some Generative AI models. Understanding how these models arrive at their outputs is often opaque. This lack of explainability can raise concerns about accountability and limit user trust. To address this, CEOs should prioritize models with explainability features, allowing human oversight and fostering trust in AI-generated outcomes. Finally, data privacy is paramount. Generative AI often requires access to vast amounts of data, raising privacy concerns. CEOs must ensure robust data governance practices are in place. This includes implementing strong data security measures, anonymizing data whenever possible, and adhering to all relevant data privacy regulations. By prioritizing these ethical considerations, CEOs can ensure their Generative AI initiatives are not only powerful but also responsible and trustworthy. Seizing the Generative AI advantage Generative AI presents a transformative opportunity for CEOs, brimming with the potential to revolutionize industries and propel businesses forward. By embracing a human-AI collaborative mindset, CEOs can forge a future where human ingenuity is not replaced but amplified by the power of generative creation. The Generative AI CEO toolkit outlined here – from fostering a strategic mindset shift to navigating ethical considerations – equips leaders to confidently guide their organizations on this exciting journey. However, the time for deliberation is over. The future is unfolding rapidly, and competitors who seize the reins of Generative AI will not only thrive in the coming era, but they will also define it. CEOs who hesitate risk being left behind, watching as their industries are reshaped by those who embrace this transformative technology. The call to action is clear: take the first step today, equip yourself with the knowledge, and step into a future of limitless possibilities fuelled by Generative AI.

    "article_content": "Getty Images The expanding capabilities and decreasing costs of AI signal a surge in AI applications, poised to redefine productivity and transform job markets. The most common hurdles in AI adoption include cost, complexity and limited understanding of AI's implications, a survey by AI fund SenseAI Ventures stated. In terms of the technologies used by the surveyed startups, cloud took the lead, followed closely by OpenAI's GPT-4o. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} The AI fund also announced the launch of a whitepaper, \"Artificial Intelligence: Beyond the Hype,\" alongwith the survey results. To complement the whitepaper, SenseAI had conducted a survey of around 100 startup founders in India who work in the AI space. The survey findings provide insights into the current state and prospects of AI in India. One of the key revelations of the survey was that SaaS (software as a service) has emerged as the dominant business model among the startups, indicating a growing preference for cloud-based AI solutions. The survey also highlighted a moderate demand for customised AI solutions among the clients of these startups, suggesting an increasing recognition of AI's potential to address specific business needs. Rahul Agarwalla, Managing Partner at SenseAI, says that two areas where Indian founders can create a real global niche for themselves are SaaS and AI tooling. “If you look at enterprise software SaaS, you will find very low adoption rates outside of the rich countries. One of the key reasons we found is that pricing is in dollars, so it's expensive when your per capita GDP is not what it is in the western advanced economies,” he says. Agarwalla adds that this is also due to the fact that in India or any of the countries with lower software adoption rates, people did not grow up with technology at home. “So people resisted adopting technology. AI completely changes that, the best example would be Zoho and how adoption of Zoho has happened across the world in all countries where incomes are lower. So it is a big opportunity,” he says. Besides this, he talks about AI tooling as another opportunity that must be tapped due to the large talent pool that exists. “We understand exactly firsthand what the challenges are in using AI. And these challenges and problems are the same globally. And because we have so many talented AI engineers who understand these problems and are coming up with solutions to solve those problems, you will see a massive outburst of world beating companies in AI tooling,” he says. In terms of some of the most significant risks associated with AI, the survey respondents identified security, bias, and data availability/readiness. On a more optimistic note, the respondents singled out Explainable AI (XAI), AI agents and quantum computing as the emerging technologies and trends that can create the most impact in the future. The whitepaper and survey also underscored the transformative potential of AI across various sectors. Investment in AI within healthcare was projected to reach $18.8 billion by 2027, highlighting AI's role in diagnostic and analytical applications. The AI fraud management sector was forecast to grow from a $10.4 billion valuation in 2023 to $57.1 billion by 2033, with an annual growth rate of 18.5%. The expanding capabilities and decreasing costs of AI signal a surge in AI applications, poised to redefine productivity and transform job markets. Research indicates that AI-adopting firms are on track to double their market share, with efficiency gains potentially reaching tenfold by 2024. As Agarwalla adds, “We are at a turning point where AI is no longer just a buzzword, but a force that will reshape industries, economies and societies in ways we can barely imagine. India has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to lead this change and win.” #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on AI India SenseAI survey startup cloud SaaS technology (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "ET Spotlight Special In India, the share of credit disbursed to the MSMEs as a % of GDP is very low as compared to other emerging nations. Countries such as China, South Korea, and even Bangladesh have had massive industrial growth, mainly led by MSMEs, on the back of high leverage. Increased credit to MSMEs leads to higher investment in productive assets, thereby driving economic growth and job creation. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Indian MSMEs find it difficult to get finance due to weak creditor and property rights, informal economy, lack of appropriate accounting records, and information asymmetry. Furthermore, the administrative cost of lending to MSMEs is relatively higher because of their smaller loan sizes. Collecting information on MSME’s creditworthiness requires more resources as a percentage of the underlying loan. Therefore, lending institutions may not always find it economically rational to lend to MSMEs. Therefore, banks’ lending decisions are generally dependent on collateral. However, many first-generation MSMEs, who may be having huge potential (and many ingenious ideas!), may not have the capability to fulfill the collateral requirements of banks. Therefore, because of a lack of funds, many individuals and MSEs with enormous potential cannot start or scale up their businesses. Due to credit rationing, profitable projects of micro and small enterprises may not see the light of the day, resulting in suboptimal investment and employment in the economy. In order to turn today’s worker into tomorrow’s MSME; and today’s microenterprise into tomorrow’s medium enterprise, it is necessary to plug the financing gap faced by them. As per RBI, credit outstanding to the MSME Sector as on 30.09.2022 is Rs 20.7 lakh crores. The report of the Expert Committee on MSMEs headed by U.K.Sinha had estimated the credit gap in the MSME sector in 2019 to be as much as Rs. 20-25 lakh crore. This means there is a need for more than doubling the rate of disbursal of credit to the MSME sector. Providing credit guarantees to lending institutions can play an increasingly important role in bridging this credit gap and facilitating the growth of credit to the MSME sector. By providing guarantees to the lending institutions and covering part of the default risk, credit guarantee institutions lower the lender’s risk as guarantees secure repayment of all or part of the loan in case of default. Credit Guarantee not only enables micro and small businesses without collateral to obtain loans but also leads to overall credit enhancement in the economy as many of the MSMEs without collateral would not have otherwise got credit from the lending institutions. Credit guarantee also encourages lending institutions to save on capital provisioning as the provision of guarantees reduces the capital adequacy ratio. By providing a guarantee for a percentage of a financial institution’s loan portfolio, the capital adequacy requirements against the portion of the portfolio that is guaranteed are correspondingly lower, which further leads to credit enhancement in the economy. Furthermore, since the entire risk of default is not borne by lending institutions after the provision of credit guarantees, lending institutions need not to charge a higher interest rate to take care of the risk associated with lending to SMEs. Thus, providing credit guarantees at nominal guarantee fees also allows lending institutions to extend loans at a cheaper rate to MSMEs. It is important to note that funding credit guarantee institution leads to 2x or 3x more disbursal of credit than directed credit or loan subsidies. Public credit guarantee scheme requires relatively small cash outlays, at least initially before credit losses materialize, and can guarantee a large volume of loans with a comparatively small capital base. Empirical evidence also suggests that risk management instruments can maximize public capital use, compared to equity or loan capital. Therefore, funding credit guarantee institutions can lead to better and optimum utilization of government funds. Infusion of funds in the guarantee scheme can lead to a credit revolution for the micro units in the MSME sector which will provide a massive boost for employment. In India by way of extending loan guarantees to lenders and thereby instilling confidence and risk aversion amongst the lenders, Credit Guarantee Trust for MSMEs (CGTMSE) has played an increasingly important role in facilitating the growth of credit to MSME sector. CGTMSE provides credit guarantees for a loan up to a limit of Rs. 200 lakhs with a guarantee coverage ranging from 50% to 85% for various categories of loans. As per the latest available data, the year-wise guarantee cover provided by CGTMSE has been increasing substantially since FY18 (Rs 19,066 crore) to Rs 45,851 crore in FY20 and Rs 56,172 crore in FY22. Fully understanding the importance of guarantee institutions in improving access to credit for MSMEs, in Budget 2023-24, an additional infusion of Rs. 9,000 crores has been announced in the CGTMSE corpus. Hon’ble FM announced in the parliament that this financial boost to the CGTMSE scheme would enable additional collateral-free guaranteed credit of Rs. 2 lakh crore and reduce the cost of the credit by about 1 percent. However, some more tweaks in the CGTMSE scheme can also be undertaken to improve the efficacy of the scheme further. The signup for the Guarantee cover amongst member lending institutions is still very low. Guarantee fee charged by CGTMSE from member lending institutions is believed to be high by many banks. Therefore, rationalising fee for claiming guarantee cover will go a long way in covering a bigger share of MSEs loans under the guarantee scheme. The Recent SBI report also suggests reducing the annual guarantee fees to 0.50% of the loan amount across all the slabs and making CGTMSE coverage mandatory for all SME loans up to Rs 2 crore. Moreover, the report also suggests increasing the limit for non-collateralized loans under CGTMSE to INR 20 lakh from the current INR 10 lakh for micro and small units for all activities under the manufacturing, services, and trade sector. Furthermore, by encouraging State Financial Corporation (SFC) to provide first and/or second loss guarantee to lending institutions instead of directly financing MSMEs out of their balance sheet, there can be multiple times disbursal of credit with the same amount of outlay incurred by them. At present, besides providing guarantees, the SFCs also provide financial assistance to MSMEs in various forms, such as directly providing term loans, direct subscription to the debentures or the equity, and seed capital. Sincere efforts need to be put into increasing the share of guarantees provided by SFCs to lending institutions out of the total expenditure incurred by them. Moreover, setting up a state-level credit guarantee trust for MSMEs on the lines of CGTMSE, which is at the national level, can also fulfill state-specific requirements, and provide MSMEs with easy access to funds, & banks with higher reliability.

    "article_content": "iStock Jumpstarted by the pandemic lockdowns and fuelled by rising smartphone penetration, digital payment systems have come of age in India. The launch of the e-rupee pilot by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2022 marked a new milestone for digital payments. Backed by blockchain technology, this central bank digital currency (CBDC) is an electronic version of the physical rupee, potentially representing a more secure and government-supported alternative to private digital currencies. While the wholesale pilot run of the Indian CBDC was by most accounts quite satisfactory, the focus of the present article shall be the retail CBDC, also dubbed the Digital Rupee for Retail (e₹-R). #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Road to launch Jumpstarted by the pandemic lockdowns and fuelled by rising smartphone penetration, digital payment systems have come of age in India. In 2022, the United Payments Interface (UPI) enabled some 7,404.45 crore transactions—that is 2,347 transactions per second. The total transaction value reached Rs 125.95 lakh crore, a 1.75x increase vis-à-vis 2021. A sovereign digital currency like the e-rupee could take things to the next level. CBDC systems run on the blockchain, bypassing the costs of managing and distributing physical cash. This makes CBDC transaction costs some of the lowest globally. Moreover, the systems work 24x7, all year round, ensuring real-time transactions. By introducing the e-rupee, the RBI also hopes to minimise the dangers associated with digital currencies. Last year’s FTX collapse served as a stark warning that the technology can be misused. With CBDCs, users can enjoy the benefits of digital currencies even as government oversight reduces the risks. Global interest is on the rise, with 105 nations exploring CBDCs of their own. Among the bigger economies, China was one of the first out of the gate, launching the digital yuan pilot in April 2020. So, the timing is right for India’s e-rupee pilot. With CBDCs taking off globally, the e-rupee will be needed to facilitate cross-border payments at high speed and low cost. E-rupee pilot: What to expect The first pilot phase for the retail e-rupee was rolled out on December 1, 2022, in four cities—Mumbai, New Delhi, Bengaluru, and Bhubaneswar. Tokens are being distributed by the State Bank of India , ICICI Bank , Yes Bank , and IDFC First Bank . Bank of Baroda , Union Bank of India , HDFC Bank , and Kotak Mahindra Bank will join in the second phase, during which the e-rupee will be offered in Ahmedabad, Gangtok, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Indore, Kochi, Lucknow, Patna, and Shimla as well. Gradually, the CBDC will be extended to more locations, banks, and users. The e-rupee will be issued in the same denominations as the legal tender, and users can pay peers and merchants via a digital wallet. Merchant payments could be facilitated at the merchant outlet through QR codes. Payments should feel safer, and settlement finality will be assured. Digital currency for the masses Now over to feasibility. If the e-rupee is to service India’s 1.4 billion-strong population, it will need robust technological support. The key challenge here is scaling a publicly verifiable ledger, that nevertheless ensures privacy for all users within the Indian legal context, without a bloated transaction fee that discourages small casual payments. Considering the fact that the Government spent a whopping Rs. 1,044 crore towards subsidising the UPI network for processing transactions at zero charges during the financial year 2022, the latter requirement assumes an even greater importance. Given these exacting demands and a high cash requirement, the RBI, and the academic advisors of the Indian CBDC team would do well to conduct a careful study of the top Blockchain patents by the big players such as IBM, Alibaba and nChain. The answer to meeting India specific requirements lies in ingeniously assembling a solution that takes the best features from all available Blockchain protocols and ensures unparalleled security for the users. The offline capability will be another focal point as over 60 crore Indians have no internet access. If the e-rupee is to boost financial inclusion among the unbanked, digital wallets must be able to verify transactions independently without communicating with the server. Ensuring compatibility with ubiquitous and extant digital payment systems such as Paytm , PhonePe, and GPay will also contribute to the success of the Indian CBDC. As the e-rupee rollout continues apace and new locations come under its purview, we should see more action in the digital payments space and blockchain solutions. Developers and financial service organizations will be buzzing as the adoption of the Indian CBDC becomes further widespread.

    "article_content": "With the UPI-PayNow linkage, Indian migrant workers and students based out of Singapore stand to benefit the maximum India’s UPI (Unified Payments Interface) has now gone global, with the official linkage between UPI and Singapore’s PayNow. This development is pathbreaking, especially when viewed in light of Singapore being one of India’s most significant business partners. Each year, the two countries process payments and remittances worth more than $1 billion. Singapore also boasts one of the highest GDP per capita in the world. And Indian diaspora makes up almost 9% of the total population of Singapore. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} With the UPI-PayNow linkage, Indian migrant workers and students based out of Singapore stand to benefit the maximum. Along with students and Indian migrants, UPI and Pay Now Linkage can help businesses in several ways, such as: Cross-Border Payments Made Faster, More Transparent: UPI & PayNow Linkage allows businesses to accept instant payments from customers. Without having to necessarily get other payment systems on board for faster payments. Great Opportunity to Grow Sales Just to put it in perspective, as per the RBI Remittance Survey of 2021, Singapore accounted for 5.7% of the total inward remittances. Furthermore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, their equivalent of the RBI in India, claims that the linkage is fully equipped to cater to the growing demands of remittance traffic. Unmatched Convenience Having the option to pay from the convenience of their smartphone would amplify business opportunities, also leading to greater customer satisfaction and loyalty. Lower Transaction Fees Businesses, thus, stand to benefit from lower payment processing fees and can further extend the benefits to their customers in order to boast customer retention and satisfaction. Record-Keeping Made Easy! It makes it super convenient for businesses to keep track of their expenditure and revenue. This will further allow businesses of varying scales to better manage their finances and freely pursue growth opportunities. Advantages for Digital Payment Players in India In the long term, business-wise, it is anticipated that the affiliation between UPI and PayNow will be advantageous to Indian digital payment players. Here are a few of the main advantages: New Market Access Indian digital payment providers will get access to a new market in Singapore thanks to the affiliation between UPI and PayNow. They will be able to reach more customers and grow their business as a result. Because of this connectivity, Indian companies who offer digital payment services will have the chance to explore new kinds of businesses and revenue streams. Imagine Company, which has been debating for some time whether or not to expand into south and Southeast Asia, will now have the opportunity to do so. Cost reduction Indian digital payment service providers would be able to reduce the costs of international transactions thanks to the connection between UPI and PayNow. In order to conduct cross-border transactions, Indian digital payment providers now have to rely on middlemen like banks or payment gateways. Because of the integration between UPI and PayNow, there will no longer be a requirement for using a middleman, which will result in reduced fees for financial transactions and a significant increase in available working capital. Higher Competition The combination of UPI and PayNow would heighten rivalry in India's digital payments market. This would motivate digital payment service providers in India to develop and enhance their offerings in order to remain competitive. Customers, businesses, individuals will ultimately profit from this since it will provide them more choices and better services. Here’s to futuristic collaborations and evolving technology! In a nutshell, UPI and Pay Now Linkage can help businesses improve their payment processes, increase sales, and reduce costs, resulting in improved profitability and growth. The first-of-its-kind UPI & PayNow Linkage has set in motion two very critical developments in the future. Firstly, it will create enough impetus to make UPI transactions more popular and robust throughout the nation. Furthermore, it is also imperative for India to discover similar pivots with other countries. The alliance with Singapore should be followed by more such collaborations with other emerging and leading economies across the globe.

    "article_content": "Getty Images The future of AIFs as an asset class looks promising, with strong regulatory support and ample availability of capital. The Alternative Investment Fund ( AIF ) segment in India is experiencing significant growth, and institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have acknowledged India as an economic bright spot amidst global challenges. This positive economic climate has generated considerable interest among first-time fund managers , who may have previous experience in the asset management space as a part of an institutional set-up or otherwise and are keen to launch their own ventures in the Indian market. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) under the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012, AIFs provide a structured framework for pooled investment vehicles that raise capital through private placements and adhere to defined investment policies. SEBI's AIF Regulations aim to strike a balance between effective oversight and streamlined operations, enabling fund managers to operate with a relatively lean organizational structure. Eligibility requirements include a minimum of five years of professional experience in fund management or securities advisory, along with relevant qualifications such as Chartered Accountant (CA), Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), or Master of Business Administration (MBA) in finance. The key investment team must collectively meet these criteria, and the designation of a compliance officer is mandatory. SEBI is the process of introducing an examination qualification as an alternative to the experience criteria, further simplifying the pathway for aspiring first-time fund managers. The AIF regime is a continuously evolving regulatory framework, and first-time fund managers should be cognizant of SEBI’s strong focus on compliance in light of their objective of investor protection. Accordingly, first time fund managers should establish comprehensive compliance manuals and internal processes. This would be essential in order to adhere with the regulatory requirements and fulfilling the commitments made in their AIF documentation. These safeguards would therefore avoid/mitigate any potential future regulatory and/or investor actions. Additionally, they can leverage communication channels with SEBI via participation in reputed industry bodies to collectively voice their opinions and concerns, as SEBI has demonstrated a track record of being an understanding regulator. While unregulated limited liability partnerships and other similar structures may at times appear to be the alternatives to regulated investment vehicles like AIFs for first-time fund managers, however, they may not comply with the regulatory requirements. It is therefore advisable for fund managers to avoid experimenting with these legally questionable structures. Instead, first-time fund managers may look towards an angel fund AIF license to begin with since it provides operational relaxations compared to other categories of AIFs. Despite certain investment restrictions applicable on the angel funds, the first-time fund managers who believe that the relaxations outweigh the restrictions, may at least make a beginning with such vehicles. SEBI is also actively working on developing the accredited investor framework to provide exemptions for investors who meet specific income/asset/net worth criteria. Currently, accredited investors are exempt from the minimum capital commitment requirement otherwise prescribed for investment in AIFs. These options augur well for fundraising by the first-time fund managers who also have the opportunity to raise capital from non-resident investors under the automatic route as far as exchange control laws are concerned. Therefore, the first-time fund managers may not necessarily require an overseas vehicle to begin with and as they expand, they can explore overseas options, such as GIFT City, which the Government of India has been promoting through favourable policy measures, to raise overseas capital in a more tax efficient manner. The Indian Government's commitment to economic welfare measures through AIFs underscores the sector's importance in driving growth and fostering entrepreneurship. Institutions like the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) manage dedicated Funds of Funds (FoFs) with a focus on startups and the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector, which invest in AIFs targeting these segments. Initiatives such as the Self-Reliant India Fund (SRI) and the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) further contribute to the availability of domestic institutional capital for AIFs. Indian family offices, banks, insurance companies and overseas Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), have also recognized the potential of AIFs and made significant investments in them. Notably, SIDBI even provides certain relaxations for first-time fund managers in the equity space, such as allowing for a higher management fee and operating expense structure. Large private asset managers have also launched their FoFs further adding to the pool of capital available to AIFs. The future of AIFs as an asset class looks promising, with strong regulatory support and ample availability of capital. Now may be an opportune time for first-time fund managers to take the plunge and become a part of India's remarkable growth story.

    "article_content": "iStock It’s high time we recognize the enormous potential of investing in youth-led initiatives to achieve long-lasting and sustainable change in our cities. 55-year old Ashok Behera is a resident of Mangalajodi, a wetland connected to the Chilika lagoon in Khordha, Odisha. A large population lives around this wetland and depends on fishing in the Chilika river for their livelihood. Behera had to helplessly witness the shrinking of the lake due to climate change, heavy siltation, dumping of waste and overgrowth of bamboo grass which forced him and his children to leave their ancestral home in search of a more secure future elsewhere. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} This story, as documented by UNICEF in 2022, isn't uncommon. Across India, countless citizens and communities grapple with environmental challenges, threatening their livelihoods and forcing displacement. However, amidst this despair lies a beacon of hope – the power of youth-led community initiatives. In Mangalajodi, it was the collective action of young people that stemmed the tide of migration. Through innovative WASH Guardian training modules, support from entrepreneurs, and awareness drives, they tackled the root causes of the degradation of Chilika lake. Behera, too mobilised villagers to build an institute of mitigating such crises in the future. They all created an inclusive process for the protection of left-out wetlands. Combined efforts were also initiated to protect the bird habitats around the wetland. The young people of Mangalajodi didn't wait for someone else to solve their problems. They stepped up, became leaders, and spearheaded positive change. Their story exemplifies the immense potential young people hold to address critical issues. When we empower them with the resources and support they need, they can become the driving force behind a brighter future for their communities. Youth-led development places the power for change directly in the hands of the very people who will inherit the consequences of that development. It's a shift from a passive beneficiary model to one of active ownership and empowerment, equipping them to identify challenges, co-create solutions, and become active participants in shaping their urban landscape. This fosters a deeper sense of belonging and responsibility, leading to initiatives that are more contextually relevant and likely to endure. Take the story of 11-year-old Prasiddhi Singh who began her ‘green activist’ journey after witnessing the devastating loss of tree cover in the 2016 Vardah cyclone. At age four, she participated in plantation drives around her neighbourhood, engaged with NGOs and like-minded folk. Giving nature a chance to breathe again, Prasiddhi started the ‘Prasiddhi Forest Foundation’ in 2018 in Chengalpattu with the intent to increase green cover, nurture biodiversity and make recycling a way of life. Today, her foundation has planted more than 100,000 trees. Their efforts not only contributed to a greener city but also inspired countless others to take action. But for every Prasiddhi, there are countless other young minds waiting to be nurtured and empowered. Strategies for success Investing in youth-led development goes beyond financial resources. True impact lies in a fundamental shift: listening to young voices and extending support through partnerships. Mentorship and access to role models are key pillars of this approach, providing guidance that can help them translate their ideas into action and give them a tangible path to follow. Equally important is collaboration that bridges the gap between youth-led initiatives and CSOs, government agencies and the private sectors to create a synergistic ecosystem of support. Technology also serves as a powerful enabler. Platforms such as Instagram and YouTube offer opportunities for outreach and advocacy, while crowdfunding provides a means of financial support independent of traditional funding sources. But perhaps most crucial of all is the creation of safe spaces – physical and virtual environments where young people can connect, learn, and share ideas free from judgment. These spaces serve as incubators for innovation, fostering a sense of belonging and empowerment that is essential for sustainable development . Creating lasting change While top-down development models have played their role in urban development , it is time we also recognise the immense potential of investing in youth-led initiatives for creating lasting and sustainable change in our cities. By investing in youth-led community development , we invest in a brighter future for our cities. We empower young minds to become agents of change, build stronger communities, and create a more equitable and sustainable urban landscape. It's time for us – corporations, policymakers, and civil society to recognise that the solutions to our most pressing challenges lie not in isolation but in collaboration and collective action.

Farmers Edge Inc. was taken private at a tiny fraction of its initial public offering. Gro Intelligence , named by Time magazine as one of the 100 Most Influential Companies, is shutting down, according to a person familiar with the matter. The mistake for many of these newcomers: thinking they could easily apply the Silicon Valley playbook to the world of farming. “How many farmers do you see?” Matt Carstens, chief executive officer of Landus , Iowa’s biggest farm cooperative, asked during a presentation at World Agri-Tech Innovation Summit in San Francisco in March. “We’re all talking to ourselves. That’s cool. But somebody’s got to execute it on a farm.” The struggles show how difficult it is to change one of the world’s oldest industries, especially during a downturn in the farm economy. The task is even more challenging as the traditional powerhouse operators are also aggressively pushing high-tech services to farmers. The startups initially raked in billions of dollars from investors, benefiting from ultra-low interest rates that helped feed speculative ventures. Their vision, inspired by the likes of eBay and Uber, was to take traditional crop trading and management onto digital platforms, offering data and technologies to change practices throughout the farm supply chain. But once-plentiful funding has rapidly dried up. The global “agrifoodtech” sector raised $15.6 billion globally in 2023, down nearly 50% from a year earlier and the lowest level since 2017, according to an investment report from venture capital firm AgFunder. Bloomberg The industry giants have proved to be formidable adversaries. There was a “very, very strong industry resistance to FBN being in the market,” said Charles Baron, co-founder of Farmers Business Network. The company faced pushback from larger rivals in the inputs sector on its efforts to use collective data from growers to provide price transparency, resulting in antitrust litigation several years ago involving allegations against Bayer AG and others. But the main issue for many of the startups is the difficulty in connecting with farmers. Lance Lillibridge, who raises corn and soybeans in Iowa, said the startups don’t understand the farmer, while growers themselves are wary about sharing sensitive production data in exchange for payments linked to carbon credits. “They take our data and use it for stuff we didn’t intend for them to use the data for,” he said. “They’ve broken the trust of the farmer.” ‘One Chance’ The venture-capital community is learning that the return on agriculture technology is different from other areas, according to Marc Kermisch, chief digital and information officer at tractor maker CNH Industrial NV, which has its own strategy to connect farmers to hi-tech equipment. “Farmers are small business people at the end of the day, and they usually get one chance to plant their crop every single season,” he said. “So their bar for adding technology is really high because if they mess up their crop,” they’re impacting their profits. Dean Banks, chief executive officer of Indigo Ag, says it’s easier to talk about disrupting than it is to actually disrupt. The company ditched businesses including one that sought to use idled trucks for shipping crops, and now is primarily focused on seed coatings and helping farmers sequester carbon. Indigo Ag’s valuation dropped from almost $4 billion in July 2022 to about $200 million a year later, according to estimates from PitchBook, which provides data for private and public markets. A more recent valuation isn’t available due to lack of data, and the company declined to comment on the matter. Both investors and startup firms have been reluctant lately to disclose company valuations, said Alex Frederick, senior analyst of emerging technology in the agriculture and food sectors at PitchBook. “Investors are quicker to invest when valuations are certain, but valuations have been in free fall to a degree,” he said. Banks said Indigo has made “substantial progress,” and is seeking to reach break even by the end of the year, based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. “We’ve sold off or gotten out of the businesses where there were other people who were just as good or better doing it,” he said. Canadian-based Farmers Edge, which seeks to provide technology solutions across the supply chain, reached a market value of about C$835 million ($607 million) after its initial public offering three years ago. It was bought out earlier this year by Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. at a price 98% below that of its IPO. Evaporated valuations “The majority of the tech world experienced inflated valuations, particularly startups, and then as things started normalising after Covid those valuations kind of evaporated,” said Vibhore Arora, CEO of Farmers Edge. Arora said his mandate has been to reset the company’s direction, double down on execution and stop trying to do everything in the crowded agtech market. Gro Intelligence, which used satellite data and artificial intelligence to make crop predictions, earlier this month let go of most of its remaining staff as it faced a worsening funding crunch, and is shutting down after failing to find a buyer, according to the person familiar with the matter. The company in February parted with founder Sara Menker. Just five years ago, Gro boasted of being an alternative to the US Department of Agriculture when the agency had to cancel reports due to a government shutdown. Farmers Business Network, meanwhile, is trying to regain its footing after a recent spate of leadership departures and worker layoffs. “The down cycle in the ag industry over the past two years has affected many companies, and FBN has not been immune,” said CEO Diego Casanello. He said FBN is on the path for profitability this year on an Ebitda basis after making “many tough, prudent decisions” to focus on its most profitable and core services. FBN said in an emailed statement that it continues to grow and is serving more farms than ever across its platform. It notes that it’s a major partner to ADM , and has become their exclusive partner on managing grower sustainability programs supporting thousands of growers. It said the stiff resistance from input companies underscores farmers’ need for a competitive market. FBN had an estimated valuation of roughly $3.8 billion a few years ago, though a current figure wasn’t available. The company recently took out a short-term loan in the form of a convertible note that hasn’t yet been priced, according to a person familiar with the matter. Landus’ Carstens said both FBN and Indigo have done good work, but they “met the force of our traditional ag” and couldn’t break in. For its part, Landus, with the backing of FBN co-founder and former CEO Amol Deshpande, is launching its own digital platform initially focused on fintech, leveraging the advantages of the cooperative model to provide services to its member farmers and beyond. The agriculture technology startup space in general should be prepared for the tough financing climate to continue, said Rob Leclerc, a founding partner of AgFunder. Some companies are trying to rework their pitches to investors to emphasise the latest darling of the startup world, artificial intelligence, but it’s often a weak and transparent effort. “Companies need a really compelling story about why they are fundamentally different.” he said. “We will see a tremendous amount of failure” in the sector. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on cargill adm farm startups gro intelligence landus (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

The world community must end its monopoly on technology and ensure access for all, reiterated Indian Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi at the recently concluded G7 Summit in Apulia, Italy. Discussions during the outreach session included a range of topics such as AI, critical and emerging technologies, energy, and the Mediterranean.

This occurred during India’s presidency last year. India and Africa are inextricably linked by a shared history and culture that goes back a thousand years. Be it Indian merchants regularly sailing to the east coast of Africa in search of mangrove poles, elephant tusks, and gold and precious stones to sell in the bazaars of Calicut and Surat or the indentured labour that was brought in from India to work on the railways as well as on sugar and other plantations in Kenya, Mauritius, Madagascar, and Southern Africa. In time, the Indian diaspora, with deep family roots, became a key driver of the export of African commodities such as tea, coffee, and cotton and the import of manufactured goods and grains such as rice, pulses, and textiles both to India and the rest of the world. Beyond trade and commerce, Gandhi’s political activism in South Africa and the consequent influence on leaders such as Mandela, Casely-Hayford, Nkrumah, and Bennabi who chose ‘passive resistance’ as their guiding principle were instrumental in the peaceful independence of several African nations. Above all, the American sociologist and Pan-Africanist, William Edward Du Bois, was a great admirer of Gandhi and the work of the Indian National Congress. Joined by the Indian Ocean, a hub of global mercantile trade before the opening of the Suez Canal, Indians dominated trade and commerce in the region. Yet, it fell behind both the European and the Chinese only to have recovered in the last five years. Meanwhile, Africa has grown significantly. The incidence of social unrest has dramatically reduced. Democracy is taking root, coups are mostly peaceful and dictators open to business. One can even notice a move away from colonial influence. The withdrawal of French troops from West Africa has opened up opportunities for other countries in the lucrative mining sector, for instance. There are several factors that continue to bolster hope. Six of the world's ten fastest-growing economies are currently located in Africa. The continent is home to over 400 companies with revenues surpassing $1 billion, having a collective revenue of over $1 trillion. Household consumption is increasing at a remarkable 3.9% annual rate and is projected to reach $2.5 trillion by 2030. All this is underpinned by steady population growth, increasing urbanisation, and rising incomes. Resource-rich nations are demanding local value addition and domestic manufacturing. With the gradually diminishing influence of China, Indian companies are seen as more preferable partners and business collaborators, giving them precedence in dealing with governments and local corporations. Consumer Business Recent years have seen consumption in Africa increase at an unparalleled rate of 3.9%. With its population set to nearly double to 2.5 billion by 2050, the continent will be host to the youngest and largest population on the globe. With increased access to the internet and mobile phones, this could serve a myriad of opportunities to local and imported businesses. Mining and Materials Africa is the world's top producer of critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and manganese, despite an abundance of these reserves still being untapped. Production and distribution of these minerals will be vital for the combined global effort to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. IT and Outsourcing With a large and young pool of talent, convenient time zones, and world-class IT infrastructure, Africa is quickly emerging as the next frontier for Global Business Services (GBS) and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO). Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda are currently leading the way, but there remains a massive opportunity for the remainder of the continent if investments are made into developing the digital and technical skills of the growing workforce. Agriculture and AgriTech Despite having 60% of the world's uncultivated arable land, Africa's agricultural production remains low, creating massive potential for agritech innovation to boost yields and storage. Africa’s food and agriculture market could increase from $280 billion a year in 2023 to $1 trillion by 2030. Healthcare Local vaccine production, health insurance expansion, digital health technologies, and public–private partnerships are transforming Africa's healthcare landscape. While this sector does present challenges in Africa, they are coupled with significant opportunities for growth and innovation. Energy The global clean energy transition promises substantial investment in Africa's renewable energy sector, with countries such as Senegal, Morocco, and South Africa leading the way. In 2022, the energy sector attracted $118 billion in foreign direct investment, 60% of the FDI inflows into the continent, owing to investors recognising the urgent requirement to close the energy infrastructure gaps across the continent. Infrastructure Rapid population growth and increasing resource demand are driving infrastructure development at a rapid pace. The African Development Bank (ADB) estimates an annual budget of $130 billion and $170 billion is required for infrastructure development. Digital infrastructure serves as an area of necessity as well as opportunity. It is vital to integrate IoT across industries to develop efficient and sustainable business practices. The World Bank and ADB report there are ~650 million cell phone users in Africa, surpassing the number in Europe and North America, and growing faster than anywhere else on the globe. As African nations overcome long-standing social and political misconceptions, the continent is poised to unlock its immense economic potential, offering a wealth of opportunities for strategic investors and businesses prepared to navigate this dynamic market. India is Africa's fourth-largest trading partner, with bilateral trade roughly valued at $100 billion in 2023. Yet, this represents less than 7% of the total international trade of $1.4 trillion. Compare this with China’s $207 billion and the EU’s $300 billion contribution for the same year. With large room for growth and a clear strategy to access, Africa can produce rich dividends for India. However, it needs to address infrastructure bottlenecks, supply chain integration, and access to finance in the process.

    "article_content": "Kant added that he believes every crisis is actually an opportunity and thus, India should be very ambitious about it. India will assume the Presidency of the G20 from December 1, 2022 for a year and Amitabh Kant , G20 Sherpa of India and former Niti Aayog CEO says it will have to deal with a range of issues like geopolitical tensions, the Russia-Ukraine war , inflation and prospects of a global recession. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} “It is a very fractured world,” said Kant at the 9th Annual Forum 2022 of the Public Affairs Forum of India ( PAFI ). Listing out the challenges, Kant said the world is witnessing the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the issue with China and Taiwan. At the same time, the dollar continues to rally and the US Federal Reserve has raised its rates, all of which affects countries across the world. There are also challenges around inflation, global supply chains are disrupted, and the enormous problem of climate change. “Growing without carbonising the world will be a major challenge and more than anything else, it is very important to understand that in a post Covid world, vast segments of the population around the world have been impacted in their education, health and nutrition. If you look at the SDG 2013, it has not progressed and has in fact regressed. These will be some of the key challenges,” says Kant. The foremost challenge, according to Kant, would be how India deals with different countries during its G20 Presidency , something that Indonesia has struggled with during its current term. According to Kant, within the G20, there are the G7 countries that see the Russia-Ukraine war as an existential threat for themselves. “They feel that their very national existence has been impacted. The G20 is not a forum for discussing war and conflict and the United Nations Security Council should discuss issues of war and conflict. G20 is not the right forum, but when you talk to them [G7 nations], they say the war has severe implications on energy needs and hence impacts economics and finance. They say the food crisis as a consequence of the war has severe implications for survival in many parts of the world. Spill over from the war has bearings on economics and finance,” says Kant. G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. The G20 Sherpa for India adds that there are very hard lines drawn and the G7 doesn't even want to have a photo op or social gathering with Russia. “Indonesia has been struggling even to get a communique out of the several ministerial meetings that have been held. That is the nature of the global scenario that currently exists. Therefore, it’s important that India should not be Indonesia,” he said. Kant also believes that India should tackle the challenge of global recession and climate action. “There has to be talk of climate action because the Western world which had committed to climate finance in 2009, in Copenhagen has not lived up to its commitments made during both COP 21 in Paris and COP 26, which is about $100 million flow per year. None of the developed countries have lived up to that commitment. That's number two. I think whatever growth we talk about has to be in the context of sustainability. And the third key issue will be the issue of accelerating the pace of sustainable development goals,” he said. Kant added that he believes every crisis is actually an opportunity and thus, India should be very ambitious about it. For Kant, the world has a shared future. “Irrespective of the global geopolitical crisis, if you're not ambitious, if post World War II, the world wasn't ambitious, you would not have had a Marshall Plan. You would not have had post Bretton Woods institutions. And I think there's also a need to think of a post Bretton Woods 2.0. So, there are huge opportunities rather than a crisis. Forget the crisis. All of us should see this crisis as an opportunity to accelerate the pace of growth and lift people above the poverty line and bring sustainability to the world. And that should be our ambition,” he said. The Bretton Woods Conference, also known as the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, saw delegates from 44 nations come together in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to agree upon a series of new rules for the post-WWII international monetary system. The conference saw the creation of two key institutions - the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). G20 has 20 countries from around the world and these nations account for 85% of global GDP , 78% of global trade , two-third of the world’s population and about 92% of global patents. G20 is often considered as a forum of the most powerful grouping of nations. “The UN is paralysed, and it’s too large and unwieldy. Th G7 is too elitist, and hence G20 is the right grouping to find solutions to crises,” said Kant. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on global trade international monetary fund gdp war us federal reserve Niti Aayog geopolitical amitabh kant G20 Presidency PAFI (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "Delivering the Monetary Policy Committee report, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that the merchandise trade deficit is at 8.1% of GDP and Current Account Deficit (CAD) was at 2.8% of GDP. He added that India’s import growth, though decelerating, outpaced the export growth. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} “Consequently, the trade deficit remained high in July,” he said. He also mentioned that in the months of July and August this year, services exports did very well. “In July and August, service exports continued to grow at a robust pace amidst resilient demand for software and business services and modest recovery in travel services,” he said. He added that exports of services grew at a robust pace of 35.4% year on year during April-June this year. “For the same period remittances rose by 22.6%. The net surplus on exports of services is expected to partly offset the higher trade deficit so as you can see, both- services sectors have grown at a robust pace of 35.4% and remittances have grown by 22.6%. And that is why I'm making the statement that the net surplus on exports of services is expected to partly offset the higher trade deficit,” he added. On Thursday, RBI had said that India’s current account deficit (CAD) has widened during the months of April to June. This was due to an increasing merchandise trade deficit. In a statement, RBI said the country’s current account balance recorded a deficit of $23.9 billion, i.e.,. 2.8% of GDP, in Q1FY23. This was a jump from $13.4 billion (1.5% of GDP) in Q4FY22. The merchandise exports in Q1 of FY22-23 reached a record high of $121.2 billion up from $117 billion in Q4 of FY21-22 and $95.5 billion in Q1 of FY21-22. This happened despite the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, the year-on-year was a five-quarter low at 26.8% since the base effect was high at 85.7% in Q1 of FY21-22. RBI Monetary Policy Report stated that amidst persisting geopolitical tensions and slowing external demand, merchandise exports lost pace during Q2 (July-August) after remaining resilient during Q1. “Merchandise imports, however, remained buoyant during both Q1 and Q2 (July-August), reflecting strong domestic demand conditions. These developments led to a widening of the merchandise trade deficit,” it read. It added that services trade excelled both in exports and imports in Q1. However, with the growth of imports better than exports, the net exports dragged down aggregate demand in Q1 of FY23. “In April-August 2022, merchandise exports were driven by petroleum products, electronics, chemicals, engineering goods and ready-made garments. Exports of iron ore, cotton yarn, plastic and linoleum, handicrafts and carpets were, however, restrained. Export restrictions on a few commodities such as wheat, steel and sugar due to domestic demand-supply balance also weighed on merchandise exports,” the report said. At the same time, rising domestic demand and high international commodity prices propelled merchandise imports in H1of FY2022-23 (April-August), says the report. “The trade deficit more than doubled to $124.5 billion in April-August 2022 from $ 53.8 billion a year ago,” it said. In the meantime, trade in the services sector showed robust growth in H1 of FY2022-23 (April-July) and started seeing significant recovery year-on-year. The exports growth in the service sector remained in double digits for the 5th consecutive quarter in Q1 this year. This was because of rising exports in software services, business, travel and transportation services. “Software and business services together constitute more than 60 per cent share of India’s total services exports. Although the risks of a recession in the US and Europe weigh on the software services sector, India’s offshoring capabilities and competencies and significant investments made by the major IT companies towards automation, cost efficiency, cloud adoption and technology are expected to keep the sector resilient,” the report read. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Shaktikanta Das Monetary Policy RBI recession inflation GDP service exports trade deficit (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

These shocks have produced a profound impact on the global economy. Now, we are in the midst of a third major shock, a storm arising from aggressive monetary policy actions, especially from advanced country central banks. The necessity of such actions is driven by their domestic considerations, but in a highly integrated global financial system, they inevitably cause negative externalities through spill overs. The recent rate hikes and forward guidance about further big rate hikes have caused a tightening of financial conditions, extreme volatility and risk aversion,\" Das said. He further said all segments of the financial market, including equity, bond and currency markets, are in turmoil across countries. “There is nervousness in financial markets with potential consequences for the real economy and financial stability. The global economy is indeed in the eye of a new storm. Despite this unsettling global environment, the Indian economy continues to be resilient. There is macroeconomic stability, the financial system remains intact with improved parameters,” he added. The RBI Governor further said that stable exchange rate is a beacon of financial and overall macroeconomic stability and market confidence. “Depite the d turmoil in currency markets across the world, The movement of the Indian rupee has however, been orderly compared to most other countries,\" he said. Asserting that the rupee remains a ‘freely floating currency’ whose exchange rate is market determined, he added the Reserve Bank does not have any fixed exchange rate in mind. The Central Bank intervenes in the market to curb excess volatility and maintaining macroeconomic stability expectations, he pointed out. “Our actions have helped in encouraging investor confidence as reflected in the return of capital flows since July over the medium term. The primacy of price stability embedded in our flexible inflation targeting framework provides the anchor for exchange rate stability. In a policy tightening cycle, it is arduous to provide consistent forward guidance, particularly in a highly uncertain environment,” he said, adding that the goverment’s actions will be calibrated to the incoming data and the evolving scenario without being constrained by any textbook approach to policymaking. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Global economy rbi shaktikanta das Monetary Policy report macroeconomic covid 19 ukraine (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "iStock A severe cleanup of the tax regime can be expected. Taking the indirect taxation structure into consideration, the GST has done a good job so far at mopping up indirect revenue for the government. The 2023-24 Indian Budget comes at a crucial juncture, considering global events as well as the internal eco-political situation. Globally, the war continues to simmer on with no end in sight, while a new aggression emerges each time talks of a ceasefire are initiated. With the western economies ( Europe and US) reeling under inflation , Indian external trade has taken a hit, bringing it down from 50% to 35% in recent years. In December 2022 alone our exports fell by 12.2% on a y-o-y basis. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} On the other hand, manufacturing supply has been easing due to China doing away with its zero tolerance to Covid policy. But it will take another 12-15 months for things to normalize and for trade to flow smoothly. Accompanying global disarray, a similar situation is also persisting close to home. 2023 being the year of India ’s ascendency to the G20 Presidency, there would be greater expectations on how we use budget allocation to lead by example especially with the ‘Healing our Earth’ theme. The general elections set up for next year would force the FM’s hand to keep the budget populist, with some necessary leeway thrown in to ensure enough capital and expenditure for employment and development. Overall, this budget will reflect a bigger impact in terms of next year’s elections, and it would be interesting to see how the FM pushes a tough target to achieve a GDP number of $5bn, given the current global scenario. Things to keep in mind from Budget 2022-23 The focus on public investment in modern infrastructure will help in generating employment and increasing consumption power in the hands of the public, while simultaneously developing key infrastructure for the private sector to build on or feed from. The government is also taking the lead in increasing investment in energy and sunrise spaces, considering the capital-intensive and risky nature of the clean energy sector. This is to hopefully provide industrialists and entrepreneurs the push required to follow on with their initiatives as well. This theme comes full circle with India’s proposition from the G20 presidency, cementing a clear-cut spot for clean energy on this year’s budget. Since inclusive development and financing of investment were both key themes from the last budget, the path following them will be watched by all during this year’s roundup as well. Keep an eye out for the following themes in the 2023-2024 budget A severe cleanup of the tax regime can be expected. Taking the indirect taxation structure into consideration, the GST has done a good job so far at mopping up indirect revenue for the government. But the structure has become extremely complicated with multiple loopholes and a persisting need to read between the lines. Simplifying this regime will be beneficial for all parties involved. The average taxpayer is always hoping for better tax relief, but the amounts for Section 80C have become obsolete in today’s high inflationary scenario. Also, there are rumors of 10 lakhs and above being in the 25% bracket and as well as an addition of a new slab for 30% at 15 lakhs or 20 lakhs and above levels. With elections around the corner, this would be the best chance for the government to take the populist move and provide better tax relief to placate the needs of the people. But since this is their easiest stream of revenue, it does not seem likely any compromises will be made. If nothing, cleaning up the capital tax regime and having the same tax levels for capital asset classes will help pacify any objections to a certain degree. Another important aspect the government needs to tackle is efficiency in the tax collection process. While efforts have been made toward automating and making the process less painful, there are server issues and bugs still persistent in the system. Moving away from the talks of taxation, India’s fiscal deficit has taken a turn for the worse in recent years since the country has taken the responsibility of funding all its internal spending. This year, the aim should be to hit a 6.4%-6.5% range as compared to the 9.2% that it had reached last year. Maintaining a 6% range would provide a sigh of relief and instill confidence in the larger population. All in all, this year’s budget will help solidify India’s way forward during a time of global recession and economic unrest. The government’s decisions will play a big role in either boosting the morale of its people or will provide yet another reason for the public to err on the side of caution.

    "article_content": "ET Special India is at the cusp of economic transformation, and we are witnessing its transition to a higher per capita income country. In order to realise this objective, it is imperative to harness the strength of the manufacturing sector which will bring in more income to the economy and create employment opportunities. Therefore, enterprises manufacturing in India should be internationally competitive and an integral part of global supply chains. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} This vision led to the development of the PLI scheme by the government, and the initiative will play a pivotal role in providing impetus to India’s manufacturing. As a scheme that is outcome oriented and focused in its approach, policymakers have selected sectors in a way that allows the manufacturing sector to benefit optimally while keeping the overall objectives intact at the same time. In the Indian landscape, there are certain sectors that can help anchor the success of this scheme and the aim is to create global champions in these sectors. The Government of India has implemented PLI schemes in 14 key sectors with an overall outlay of Rs. 1.97 lakh crore (USD 24 billion) and it has been specifically designed to attract investments in sectors of core competency and cutting-edge technology. The focus on these aspects will ensure efficiency and bring economies of scale to make Indian manufacturers push the productivity frontier and be competitive in domestic markets and exports. Changed geo political circumstances in the aftermath of COVID also positions India as a reliable supply chain partner. Further our country is at the cusp of a multi-year capex cycle which is expected to provide a major boost to the overall economy and the PLI scheme is giving a major impetus to this positive upcycle by developing the manufacturing infrastructure in the country. Most PLI schemes were mobilised in 2021-22 after obtaining necessary approvals and selecting beneficiaries. Given that the tenure of the scheme is 5 years or more, most of these are in the initial stages of implementation. The existing PLI schemes come with a sunset clause and as one approaches the tenure of the scheme, the incentives are accordingly tapered to make the industry self-sufficient. The early response from the industry has been very encouraging. With positive initial response from the industry, recent figures suggest that by FY-23, around Rs. 70,000 crores of investments have poured in across the PLI schemes. This investment is nearly 21% more than what was committed during this period. The value of actual production for FY 23 is around 3.75 lakh crores which is nearly 33% more than the targeted value of production during this period. In addition, the value of exports during this period under the scheme stands at around Rs. 2.6 lakh crores. While analysing this data, one should take two factors into consideration. Firstly, certain sectors such as ACC batteries, high energy solar PV modules and specialty steel are still in their gestation period. Secondly, we have just come out of the COVID-19 years when manufacturing within the country was severely impacted. As is evident from these figures, these schemes have garnered tremendous response from investors. This can be attributed to the non-discriminatory nature of PLI schemes by which foreign and domestic companies are provided a level playing field to avail the benefits of the scheme after meeting threshold targets of growth and production. This, in turn, has a clear multiplier effect in creation of jobs, increase of incomes and creation of ancillary industry. In large scale electronics manufacturing PLI, Apple Inc. is participating through three of its contract manufacturers viz. Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron. Apart from Apple, Samsung is also participating actively in this scheme. In fact, the import of mobiles has come down drastically after the introduction of PLI schemes from 78% in FY 15 to just 4% in FY 23. There has been nearly a 100% increase in export of mobile phones in FY 23 compared to FY 22. PLI scheme has been a major contributor in the success of mobile manufacturing within the country. In IT hardware PLI, Dell and Flextronics are major players participating. Similarly, pharma sector PLI has Centrient, Cadila, CIPLA, Glenmark, Lupin as its major beneficiaries. Medical devices import has reduced substantially owing to investments made by companies such as Wipro GE, Phillips, Siemens etc. under the PLI scheme. In the telecom sector, Samsung, Jabil, Flextronics, Commoscope, Nokia are some of the companies that have participated in the scheme. In the automobile sector, more than 40% of the approved beneficiaries of the PLI are headquartered overseas. Daikin, Nidec, Panasonic, Mitsubishi, LG are bringing in substantial investment in the white goods sector. In the labour-intensive food processing sector, the participation of industry has been overwhelming. PLI schemes are committed to bring and nurture the entire manufacturing ecosystem in the identified sectors via the creation of forward and backward linkages. Of course, under PLI schemes, OEMs that have been selected as beneficiaries are into manufacturing of the identified products, but part of this process of manufacturing is undertaken through smaller players or MSMEs. Thus, the entire ecosystem of MSMEs derive benefits from the PLI schemes by associating themselves with the OEM manufacturers. This benefit is not restricted to financial incentives, but also encompasses technological absorption. Even though PLI schemes are seen as schemes designed for OEMs, MSMEs account for nearly 25% of the total beneficiaries selected across all PLI schemes. In conclusion, PLI schemes in India are helping the country become a reliable supply chain partner. By providing financial incentives for the domestic production of certain goods, the PLI schemes help strengthen the domestic manufacturing ecosystem and form resilient supply chains. This strategy, in turn, will allow Indian companies to be globally competitive and help India’s transition to a high per capita income economy.

    "article_content": "iStock There is recognition that strong ESG performance can lead to better risk management, enhanced reputation and potentially superior financial performance. Indian companies are increasingly adopting environmental, social and governance ( ESG ) standards, and it is leading to the emergence of many new consultancies and firms in this space. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} According to Noida-based market researcher UnivDatos Market Insights, the country’s sustainability consulting and ESG market was valued at $255.21 million in 2021. This number is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7.42% from 2022-2030. Register for the ET MSME Day 2024 here. Presenting an understanding of the reason behind this shift, Rathin Kukreja, Senior Practice Leader & Director-Consulting, CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics, says the government and regulatory bodies have been increasingly focusing on sustainability and corporate governance. “Policies such as the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) mandated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) have driven companies to adopt ESG practices. Similarly, RBI (the Reserve Bank of India) and IRDA (the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority) have also come up with disclosure mandates for FIs on climate risk,” he says. Anu Chaudhary, Partner, Global Head of ESG Consulting of Gurugram-based Uniqus Consultech, says the ambitious target of major countries to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, coupled with the outcomes of COP 28 (UN’s Conference of the Parties), has highlighted the importance of sustainability to governments and businesses globally. A growing number of domestic and international investors are asking companies to demonstrate strong ESG performance. Investors are increasingly considering ESG criteria in their investment decisions, which pushes companies to seek expertise in this area. “There is a growing expectation from other stakeholders as well, including customers, employees and the general public, for companies to operate responsibly and sustainably,” says Kukreja. Awareness in business Companies are also becoming more aware of the long-term benefits of sustainable practices. There is recognition that strong ESG performance can lead to better risk management, enhanced reputation and potentially superior financial performance. “Financial institutions are increasingly integrating ESG criteria into their lending and investment processes, encouraging companies to enhance their ESG performance to secure financing,” says Kukreja. Shaayak Chatterjee, co-founder of Bangalore-based Breathe ESG , explains that between 2020 and 2022 alone, ESG reporting among India's top 1000 companies surged by over 160%. “This growth was further catalysed by then Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who in 2023 emphasised the need for chartered accountants to incorporate carbon, CSR and ESG practices into their services. This aligns with the shift towards a new economic paradigm fuelled by technology-driven startups and industries transitioning to modern operational frameworks. ESG reporting is not limited to listed companies with exporters and suppliers also having to adopt ESG practices to preserve their competitive advantages,” he says. Both Breathe ESG and Uniqus was formed in 2022. Clientele and fees As per a recent report by foundit (Monster APAC & ME), salary of an ESG consultant ranges from Rs 5.4 lakh to Rs 15 lakh in India. CRISIL’s Kukreja says that services such as BRSR and sustainability reporting are priced lower as compared with strategy solutions such as climate risk assessment, supply chain assessment, decarbonisation road maps and life cycle assessment (LCA). Consultancy fee is also a function of sector, number of locations of the organisation as well as whether the services are sought on standalone basis or on consolidated basis (including subsidiaries, joint ventures, etc). Uniqus serves a global clientele across the Middle East, India and the USA who come from various sectors such as IT, financial services, healthcare, FMCG, real estate, technology, PE/VC funds, aviation, apparel and chemical industry. “A company just beginning its ESG journey will have diverse needs, such as setting up processes for data collation, training, and capacity building, compared to a company advanced in the sustainability journey, which may have more complex requirements. Whereas, a larger company with a global supply chain may have more advanced needs, such as decarbonisation strategy and supply chain evaluations. The combination of all these factors and the scope of services determines the overall charges for ESG consultancy services,” she says. Even for Breathe ESG, whose clients include players from real estate, manufacturing and steel, the pricing of ESG consultancy services can significantly vary across the industry. Top-tier consultants may charge premium rates for extensive ESG integration, while smaller players might offer partial services at substantially lower costs, Chatterjee says. “To address this disparity and provide comprehensive value, Breathe ESG has developed a four-tier pricing structure. Each tier is tailored to factors such as the number of assets owned, employee headcount, desired depth of carbon emissions calculations, and compliance with data security regulations. This approach not only ensures that each client receives the appropriate level of service and features but also aligns the cost with the scope and impact of their specific ESG initiatives,” he says. Challenges Surely, the ESG services are growing but consultancies have their own share of struggles. These include, awareness and understanding, data availability and quality, regulatory challenges, among others. Both Kukreja and Chaudhary say that many companies struggle with collecting comprehensive and accurate ESG data. The quality of ESG data can be poor, and there may be issues with reliability and verification. “Many companies need help to accurately measure and report ESG data and metrics, specifically Scope 3 emissions, which involve indirect emissions from the entire value chain. Unlisted suppliers often need mature ESG data collection systems and processes, which can pose a challenge in estimating the net emissions of the parent company,” says Chaudhary. In terms of awareness, there is a lack of understanding of ESG principles and their importance, says Kukreja. “There is a need for more education and training programmes to help businesses understand and implement ESG practices effectively. There is a shortage of skilled professionals with expertise in ESG, making it difficult for the organisation,” says Kukreja. The regulatory landscape for ESG is rapidly evolving, which can create uncertainty for companies trying to stay compliant. Ensuring compliance with ESG regulations and guidelines can be challenging, especially for smaller firms with limited resources. Navigating the evolving regulatory requirements can be daunting for many businesses, says Breathe ESG’s Chatterjee. There are challenges related to cost considerations as well, Kukreja says that implementing comprehensive ESG strategies and reporting can be expensive, particularly for smaller companies. “Companies often struggle to see the immediate financial benefits of investing in ESG. Many companies still perceive ESG and sustainability as a compliance cost.” In another interesting challenge, Chaudhary points out that the industry faces characteristic challenges in India. ESG responsibilities within organisations reside with multiple stakeholders. “In some organisations, the investor relations team has ESG responsibilities, and within some organisations, the strategy teams steer the ESG agenda. This requires consulting companies to tailor the requirements and delivery models to cater to the varying needs of organisations,” she adds. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on esg msme day unitdatos breathe esg crisil uniqus (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

Reuters - Fisker filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, the latest electric-vehicle startup to succumb to fundraising difficulties, slow sales, as well as supply chain and distribution challenges. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Demand has been weak for Fisker's flagship Ocean electric SUV. The company cut jobs and paused investments to slow cash burn, partnered with dealerships to boost sales and desperately sought an investment from a major automaker to stay alive. None of that worked. Other U.S. EV startups are lowering manufacturing costs, laying off workforce, and racing to develop cheaper models to navigate a slump in demand due to steep borrowing costs. RIVIAN AUTOMOTIVE Rivian this year shut down its assembly line for weeks to retool the facility - a move meant to reduce costs and help the maker of R1S SUVs and R1T pickup trucks turn profitable. To boost demand and increase efficiency, Rivian recently announced the second generation of vehicles with new drive units, upgraded software and fewer parts. After shying away from cutting the price of its vehicles last year, Rivian in February introduced lower-range options for its existing cars. The startup has focused on reducing its cash burn by re-negotiating supply contracts and building some components in-house. Rivian posted cash and cash equivalents of $5.98 billion for the first quarter, compared with $7.86 billion in the fourth quarter. In March, Rivian also introduced its smaller, less expensive electric R2 SUVs and R3 crossovers with plans to start producing the R2 at its existing U.S. factory to hasten deliveries in the first half of 2026. LUCID GROUP Lucid Group said in May it will reduce its workforce in the United States by 6%. The company has missed analysts' expectations for revenue for six straight quarters. It has slashed the price of the Lucid Air Pure and is including two years of free scheduled maintenance and charging allowance as an incentive. Lucid in November unveiled its Gravity SUV that will start under $80,000 and is expected to go into production late this year. To attract a larger customer base, Lucid, backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, is set to start production of a more affordable mid-size car in late-2026 with a price point of around $50,000. Lucid ended the first quarter with cash and cash-equivalents of $2.17 billion, compared with $1.37 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. NIKOLA Nikola is pivoting to big rigs powered by hydrogen, after some of its battery-electric trucks caught fire in August and forced a recall. The company expects up to $170 million in truck revenue for 2024 with a target to sell 450 units this year, including its hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks. Nikola's cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter was $345.6 million, down from $464.7 million in December. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on EV startups weak demand Fisker bankruptcy protection Rivian Automotive (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

Citing research that people spend 90% of their overall time indoors, the Eindhoven headquartered company says NatureConnect addresses this need by utilizing elements of nature in interior spaces to create healthy, engaging, and inspiring environments with a proven biophilic design principle. In 2016, Signify, the Dutch lighting corporation, was created as a result of electronics giant Philips spinning off its lighting division. Nature Connect’s innovative technology aims to replicate the diverse changes in sunlight that occur throughout the day. By doing so, it claims to have a profound impact on both the physical and mental well-being of its customers. This specific technology is said to help regulate our body’s circadian rhythm, leading to improved health, increased energy levels, enhanced mood, heightened productivity, better quality of sleep, and an overall sense of well-being. Sumit Joshi, CEO & MD - Signify, Greater India said, “NatureConnect is tailor-made to bring natural light indoors. Its revolutionary lighting system, developed through extensive research recreates the positive effects of natural light indoors, for professional spaces, hospitality, and the healthcare industry in India. By utilizing energy-efficient LEDs and smart controls, NatureConnect seamlessly adjusts to the changing light patterns throughout the day, enhancing overall well-being and improving productivity.” By enhancing circadian rhythm, the company asserts Nature Connect improves sleep-wake cycles and promotes better sleep quality. Additionally, it is claimed to enhance a positive mood and lower stress levels, besides boosting concentration and productivity. The NatureConnect system is designed to recreate the natural rhythms of sunlight with three key components: SkyRibbon, Daylight, and Skylight. These components provide a soft glow, mimic daylight patterns, and simulate natural sunlight streaming in. The system can be installed in various ceiling types and includes the NatureConnect link for integration with popular control systems. Users can easily select scenes, adjust brightness levels, and create customized lighting experiences. “Bringing in the right light and the right moment, NatureConnect offers the colours and dynamics of nature for a fully immersive experience, helping individuals reconnect with the constant cycles and variations of nature,\" said Girish K Chawla, Head of Professional Business – Signify, Greater India. Considering the growing importance of health and well-being, the company believes that NatureConnect will play a significant role in boosting productivity and revolutionizing lighting experiences across different sectors and industries. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on NatureConnect Signify lighting biophilic design circadian rhythm sleep quality (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "ET Online India has a bright future in the area of food processing and setting up of more processed units across the country would help empower farmers and boost their income, said Chirag Paswan , Union Minister of Food Processing Industries, on Wednesday at the curtain raiser event on World Food India-2024 in Delhi. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} The four-day mega event World Food India 2024 will be organised from 19 to 22 September 2024. “India’s food processing capabilities have immense potential. Unfortunately, still we haven't even tapped 10% of the sector's potential. Both international and local markets have immense possibilities in store for our food processing sector,” Paswan noted. Paswan, who represents Hajipur Lok Sabha constituency in Bihar, said that there are several initiatives that the Ministry of Food Processing could take and implement on ground to actually benefit scores of farmers in the country. “The bananas grown in Hajipur go to several states including the south of India, where they are processed in the form of chips. I believe if these processing units could be set up in Hajipur itself, the local farmers can gain much more,” he said. Ravneet Singh Bittu, MoS, Food Processing Industries and Railways, also talked about how food growers can benefit from food processing facilities. He also said that World Food India-2024 can provide a platform to local companies to showcase their products at the international level. “The exports of processed foods have grown significantly over the years. The exports which stood at 13.7% in FY15 have grown to 25.6% in FY23. There are immense opportunities in this sector. Even the foreign direct investment (FDI) stood at US$6.185 billion in the same period. In addition, there is a big scope for employment opportunities in this field,” said Bittu. Meanwhile, Anita Praveen, Secretary, Ministry of Food Processing Industries, and Minhaj Alam, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Food Processing Industries, were also present at the event. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on food processing units india chirag paswan ministry of food processing world food india 2024 hajipur farmers (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "iStock This exit was achieved 45 months after the initial investment. FAAD Network , a SEBI-registered Category 1 Angel Fund headquartered in Gurgaon, announced a strategic exit from Battery Smart, delivering 61x return on investment . This exit was achieved 45 months after the initial investment. Battery Smart is a home-grown battery-swapping services provider for two and three-wheelers, currently valued at $340 million (Rs 2,842 crore). The startup provides advanced lithium batteries to e-vehicles on a membership basis. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} The exit from Battery Smart was a key move, enabling FAAD Network’s founders and other investors to enjoy financial gains, approximately 370% IRR in the investment tenure, the company says. Founded by IIT Kanpur Alumni – Pulkit Khurana and Siddharth Sikka, Battery Smart is facilitating Li-ion battery swaps that are efficient, cost-effective, and accessible for the two-wheeler and e-rickshaw market. Investment from FAAD helped accelerate this growth and li-ion adoption across 30 cities and stands at 1000+ swap stations across the country. FAAD collaborated with Orios Venture Partners, Shish Ram Kharesiya, founder of BNM Retail, and other angel investors during the seed round in 2020 led by Orios Venture. FAAD Network, with a corpus of 300 crore, invests across diverse sectors and geographies in early-stage companies. \"We are extremely proud to announce our exit from Battery Smart at an astounding 61x multiple. This exit not only validates our investment approach but also underscores our commitment to creating significant value for our investors,\" Dinesh Singh, Co-founder and Director of FAAD Network, said in a statement. \"Our investment in Battery Smart and other EV-related ventures further highlight our contribution towards the growth of the EV industry, and Battery Smart's current valuation proves the immense potential within this sector. We look forward to continuing our support for innovative startups that have the potential to revolutionize their industries,” added Singh. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} ( Originally published on Jun 20, 2024 ) Read More News on FAAD Network investment Battery Smart lithium batteries (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

The brand is targeted at health-conscious consumers seeking alternatives to typical high-fat/high-sugar ice creams. Currently present in 16 cities and over 125 dark stores, Go Zero grew 4X in FY 23-24 compared to FY22–23 and witnesses a 7X growth on quick commerce in 5 months from January to May 2024. Kiran Shah, Founder, Go Zero, said in a statement, “I started Go Zero with a simple mission – to make ice creams and desserts healthier and guilt free for all. The growth that we have seen in the past 12 months has been phenomenal and proves that there is a strong demand for ‘ better for you ’ ice creams that taste really good. We have become one of the fastest-growing ice cream brands on quick commerce platforms such as Blinkit and Zepto – which I feel are going to become a key channel for the ice cream category as people seek convenience and instant gratification. With this round of funding, we will look to continue our exponential growth on quick and e-commerce along with expanding to Tier 1 cities such as Jaipur, Chandigarh, and Ahmedabad. We will also continue to launch exciting flavours and formats for our consumers throughout the year.” Ash Lilani, Founder & Managing Partner at Saama Capital, said, “The company’s immense revenue growth and profitability since our pre-seed investment last year is proof of Kiran’s product experience and the potential of India’s desserts market.” Hariharan Premkumar, Managing Director, India at DSG Consumer Partners, said, “Healthy snacking is a core investment theme at DSGCP. The company has achieved product-market fit and is set to scale rapidly. We are excited to deepen our partnership with the Go Zero team in the growth phase of their journey.” Arjun Vaidya, Co-Founder, V3 Ventures, commented, “In >1 year, we have seen >10x growth in Go Zero. It speaks about the quality of execution by the team and the wave of better eating we are seeing in India. We are excited to double down to make more Indians enjoy their favourite dessert guilt free.” Arjun Purkayastha, prominent angel investor and Regional CEO at a top MNC, remarked, “Its rapid growth and innovative product offerings demonstrate significant potential to redefine healthy desserts . I am confident that Go Zero will continue to lead the way in the guilt-free ice cream category.” Founder Kiran Shah brings extensive experience from the ice cream industry, having previously led his family business, Apsara Ice Creams, from 2014 to 2022. Under his leadership, Apsara expanded from a single-store operation to a nationwide chain with over 100 outlets. Several D2C brands in sectors such as food and beverages, apparel, and health and wellness, founded by families with traditional businesses in similar categories, are attracting significant venture capital funding. Investors believe that these entrepreneurs, with their inherent business understanding and deep-rooted connections in supply chain ecosystems, are uniquely positioned to launch contemporary versions of legacy businesses. With Kiran Shah at the helm, Go Zero aims to become a dominant player in the burgeoning Indian ice cream market, which in 2023, was valued at over USD 3 billion, with a projected CAGR of 13.49% from 2024 to 2030. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Kiran Shah Go Zero ice cream brand healthy desserts better for you quick commerce (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

These affect their ability to fulfil orders and maintain customer satisfaction, Kulkarni tells ET Digital in an interview. Overall, shipping delays and disruptions can hinder productivity, increase operational costs, and erode profitability for MSMEs in India, he adds. Edited excerpts: ET Online Register for the ET MSME Day 2024 here. The Economic Times (ET): How have Indian MSMEs been affected by the Red Sea crisis and other global trade disruptions? Ketan Kulkarni (KK): Indian MSMEs have been significantly affected due to increased transportation costs, longer lead times and uncertainty in supply chains. Such disruptions highlight the vulnerability of MSMEs to global events and emphasise the importance of building resilience in supply chains. ET: How has the Allcargo group supported MSME operations? Were any specific initiatives launched to benefit MSMEs? KK: Allcargo Gati Limited, the express distribution company of Allcargo Group, has supported MSME operations through various initiatives such as offering flexible transportation solutions, providing end-to-end logistics support, and leveraging technology to optimise supply chain efficiency . With an extensive network, cutting-edge technology, and unwavering commitment to go the extra mile for its customers, Allcargo has been a reliable partner for individuals and SMEs, to succeed and grow their businesses. Additionally, Allcargo Gati Limited has launched specific programmes tailored to MSMEs clusters, including capacity building workshops, digital transformation initiatives. Ketan Kulkarni, Chief Growth Officer, Allcargo Group ET: What specific policies has the Indian government implemented to support MSMEs during economic downturns? KK: The government’s focus goes beyond providing financial support. It actively seeks to create an environment that fosters solutions, innovation and ease of doing business. The Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan or the Self-Reliant India Scheme of 2020 by the Government of India has given a new definition for MSMEs. The Atma Nirbhar Package announced by the government provides various kinds of assistance to the economy, including the MSME sector. Examples are the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) and the Subordinate Debt for Stressed MSMEs. Additionally, the government has simplified the GST process to lower compliance costs, launched ease of doing business initiatives to reduce regulatory burdens and expedite approvals, and offered skill development programmes to enhance workforce capabilities. Support for digital transformation is also provided to improve efficiency and market access for MSMEs. ET: How can MSMEs look at making their supply chains robust amid the ever-changing geopolitical dynamics of today? What role does AI play in this setup? KK: A robust supply chain enables seamless operations and is crucial for the growth of a business. It plays a vital role in delivering better customer experience and nurturing long-term relationships with customers. Not just customers, it helps to nurture collaboration and communication between MSMEs and their vendors, thus leading to accelerated synchronisation and reduced lead durations. Supply chain digitisation brings enhanced visibility and transparency across the supply chain, empowering MSMEs to identify growth hurdles, streamline operations and make informed decisions. In addition, it unlocks opportunities for insights driven by data, enabling predictive analytics that can guide inventory management and forecast demand trends. MSMEs can make their supply chains robust amid changing geopolitical dynamics by diversifying their supplier base, investing in technology-enabled risk management tools, and fostering collaboration with key stakeholders. AI plays a crucial role in this setup by enabling predictive analytics, real-time monitoring, and scenario planning to mitigate risks and optimise supply chain performance. ET: How has the adoption of green logistics practices impacted the sustainability and cost structures of MSME operations? KK: The adoption of green logistics practices has positively impacted the sustainability and cost structures of MSME operations by reducing carbon emissions, minimising waste, and optimising resource utilisation. By embracing sustainable practices, MSMEs can enhance their brand reputation, comply with regulatory requirements, and achieve cost savings in the long run. ET: What role do third-party logistics (3PL) providers play in the growth and scalability of MSMEs in the current market environment? KK: Third-party logistics (3PL) providers play a vital role in the growth and scalability of MSMEs in the current market environment by offering specialised expertise, infrastructure, and network capabilities. 3PL providers help MSMEs streamline their logistics operations, optimise inventory management, and access new markets, thereby enabling them to focus on their core business activities and achieve sustainable growth, Allcargo Gati with its express distribution and supply chain solutions provide the same and is a trade facilitator. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on MSME Day shipping delays Allcargo Group MSMEs supply chain efficiency (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

A little over a year ago, Matan Grinberg was studying string theory for his physics Ph.D. Now, he’s a dropout with an AI startup valued at more than $100 million by investors such as Sequoia Capital . #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Grinberg is set to announce Tuesday that he has raised $15 million from Sequoia and other investors for Factory, a startup using AI to help businesses streamline coding tasks. To date, Factory has raised a total of $20 million, with other backers including Lux Capital and the chief executive officers of Hugging Face and Databricks Inc., as well as Los Angeles musical duo the Chainsmokers, through their venture arm. The company, officially called San Francisco AI Factory Inc., offers automated AI systems called Droids that help businesses generate software features, review code and solve bugs, among other engineering jobs. Factory started selling its products earlier this year, with customers including startups Bubble, Podium and Stord. Grinberg’s company joins an increasingly crowded market. Poolside AI, Magic AI and Cognition AI have each raised more than $100 million in funding to build artificial intelligence tools for software engineers. Grinberg considers GitHub Copilot, owned by Microsoft Corp., his biggest competition, but he said Factory’s technology works much better and more accurately on fully autonomous tasks. The funding also underscores the immense appetite from venture firms for all things AI. Some early AI startups are raising rounds every few months — and with much larger amounts than non-AI startups at similar stages of development. In that business climate, a string theory student like Grinberg with a promising idea can quickly land millions. “Some people might think, ‘What is this physicist doing here?’” he said. “It’s not lost on me.” Then he quickly rattled off a list of former physicists who have gone into tech. The list includes Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, who for a time studied physics at Princeton University, where Grinberg earned his undergraduate degree. Grinberg, 26, conceived of Factory after an April 2023 walk with Sequoia’s Shaun Maguire inspired him to think of startup ideas. He enlisted co-founder Eno Reyes, a friend and fellow Princeton graduate, who was then working as an engineer at AI startup Hugging Face. Days after the walk with Maguire, Grinberg presented to Sequoia partners. They greenlit an initial $1 million investment for the fledgling business. But before Grinberg formally pitched his company to Sequoia, he said he had to promise Maguire that he would work on the startup full time. Grinberg filed his paperwork for a leave of absence from the University of California at Berkeley the day before his Sequoia presentation and sent a screenshot. Maguire also happens to have studied physics, with a Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Sequoia Capital Sequoia AI engineering tasks Matan Grinberg (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

It possesses a vibrant labor market and a currency that's not just a store of value, but increasingly seen as an ascendant strategic asset. And it’s not the China of yesteryear. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} The lucky country is the US, a place so often said to have been on the verge of eclipse for various reasons such as big deficits, the euro and China's seemingly inexorable climb to economic supremacy. Numerous threats have fizzled or have been proven exaggerated. There's little denying that the past few years have seen a major shift in how the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two are assessed. For now, the US economy is in a good place, as a couple of new reports indicate. Perhaps the biggest threat comes not from outside, but has its origins in domestic strains. The term de-dollarization has been fashionable in recent years. It's a pithy way of describing disillusionment with the greenback, in part because of sanctions against Washington's antagonists. Viewed cynically, this is a successor to dollar debasement , a conservative rally cry in the years immediately after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., when the Federal Reserve embarked on massive easing. The dollar collapse didn't happen then and isn't occurring now, according to figures from International Monetary Fund sent to Bloomberg News. The US attracted almost one-third of investment that flowed across borders since the pandemic erupted, a marked increase from the pre-Covid average of 18%, the IMF numbers showed. China's slice dipped to 3%, a bit less than half what is was in the decade through 2019. That jives with data from Beijing: Foreign investment slowed for a fourth month in April and is down 36% from the same period a year earlier. The once-thriving industry that churned out timetables for when China would overtake the US has gone quiet. In a major global review, Capital Economics projects America will be dominant for some time. This judgement rests on the dollar’s premier role, the size and scope of US capital markets, an abundance of natural resources and, at a time of doomsaying about dwindling fertility, a sound expansion in the labor force. Could this conclusion have been reached at any time? Quite possibly, but vital ingredients are a lead in artificial intelligence and a re-affirmation of financial prowess. “If you just look at pure economic dominance, China hasn't come anywhere close to the US and we don't think it ever will,” Jennifer McKeown, the firm’s chief global economist, told me. “There has been a major shift in thinking around this. Economists have been coming around to the view that China’s model just isn’t sustainable.” If China's catch-up to the US has stalled, then what could undo this monetary version of Pax Americana? Leadership isn't just about whether shortcomings ultimately become so great that they trip an incumbent up. A potent rival has to arrive at just the right moment and offer all the advantages and less of the negatives. That isn't China, the euro zone or the collective might — on paper — of the BRICS bloc. The dollar is a huge geopolitical asset, but that reflects nothing God given nor set in stone. If the US loses interest in leadership or its internal divisions prove so deep that fiscal policy truly runs off the rails, the country will ultimately lose authority over the financial system. Chipping away at the Fed’s independence and driving the greenback down for the purposes of gaining a trade advantage would be a deeply troublesome approach. “If the US doesn't keep its house in order, dollar dominance would be the least of our worries,” Steven B. Kamin and Mark Sobel, prominent former US officials, wrote in the Financial Times last week, reprising their work for the American Enterprise Institute. The US has sometimes favored what amounts to devaluation, though it’s rarely been expressed in quite those terms. The Plaza Accord of 1985, signed by the-then Group of Five, subsequently to become the G7 , urged a big appreciation of the yen and deutschemark. After the dollar fell too far, officials tried to reverse the pact. And the policymakers who sank the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates in 1971 predicted, and possibly desired, a weaker greenback. Yet here we are. Next time someone asserts the US is in decline, ask them how. If they blather about economic foundering, ask them where they have been the past few years. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on china IMF US dominance Capital Market dollar (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

Artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT are finding widest use at big companies, but there is wide expectation that the impact will spread. The Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce in Tennessee has convened an annual meeting of local business leaders since the 1800s, but the most recent gathering had a decidedly modern theme: artificial intelligence . #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} The goal was to demystify the technology for the chamber's roughly 2,000 members, especially its small businesses. \"My sense is not that people are wary,\" said Ralph Schulz, the chamber's CEO. \"They're just unclear as to its potential use for them.\" When generative AI surged into the public consciousness in late 2022, it captured the imagination of businesses and workers with its ability to answer questions, compose paragraphs, write code and create images. Analysts projected that the technology would transform the economy by driving a boom in productivity. Yet so far, the impact has been limited. Although adoption of AI is rising, only about 5% of companies nationwide are using the technology, according to a survey of businesses from the Census Bureau. Many economists predict that generative AI is years away from measurably affecting economic activity -- but they say change will come. \"To me, this is a story of five years, not five quarters,\" said Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak, global chief economist at Boston Consulting Group. \"Over a five-year horizon, am I going to see something measurable? I think so.\" While some of the largest companies, in Nashville and elsewhere, are finding uses for AI -- and devoting money and time to developing more -- many smaller companies are just starting to dabble in the technology, if they use it at all. \"The best and the biggest are actually working on implementing it and getting value from it now, but the adoption curve is really early,\" Carlsson-Szlezak said. Allison Giddens , a co-president at Win-Tech, an aerospace manufacturing company with 41 employees in Kennesaw, Georgia, said she started using ChatGPT about six months ago for some operational tasks, including writing emails to employees, analysing data and drafting basic procedures for the company's front office. A note taped to her computer monitor says simply \"ChatGPT\" to remind her to use the technology. \"We have to get in the habit of actually using the tool,\" she said. But she faces hurdles in implementing it more broadly and using it to make her company more efficient. Sometimes she finds ChatGPT's responses off base. Cybersecurity is important in her industry, so she must be careful about the information she feeds into AI models. And she hasn't found a place for the technology on the factory floor, where machinists make custom aluminum and titanium parts for the defense industry. \"There's not a whole heck of a lot of use cases for the shop floor yet,\" she said. NYT News Service Allison Giddens, a co-president at Win-Tech, an aerospace manufacturing company, at her office in Kennesaw, Ga., June 10, 2024. Technological innovations, including computing and the internet, have historically taken many years or decades to diffuse through the economy and affect productivity and output. American economist Robert Solow said in 1987, \"You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.\" Economists generally believe that the diffusion and adoption of generative AI will occur much faster, in part because information flows more quickly than it did in the past. The consulting firm EY-Parthenon, for instance, concluded in a recent series on generative AI that the technology could juice productivity in three to five years. But there are some significant barriers, including hesitation around using the technology, legal and data security hurdles, regulatory friction, cost and the need for more physical and technological infrastructure to support AI, including computing power, data centers and software. \"We're still at the initial stages of the revolution in that we have started to see significant investment in establishing the foundations for that revolution,\" said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. \"But we have not yet seen the full extent of the benefits from a productivity standpoint, from a greater output standpoint, from a greater labor deployment standpoint.\" David Duncan, CEO of First Hospitality, a hotel management company in Chicago, said the company was working to ensure that its internal financial data could be used by AI systems in the future. \"We're planning for the next generation of applications of AI,\" he said. Duncan said he envisioned using AI to analyze this data and create initial drafts of reports, freeing up executives and general managers. The company, with about 3,600 employees, also hopes to leverage AI to analyze weekly surveys of workers over the course of a year to glean insights about trends in their teams' overall morale. \"I think we're in the early stages of a massive transformation of the way we process business ideas, strategy, data and outputs,\" Duncan said. According to surveys, AI use is greatest in the information and professional services, which include graphic design, accounting and legal services -- traditionally white-collar jobs that have been less threatened by automation. The research shows that marketing is among the most common uses for AI across all businesses. Gusto, a small-business payroll and benefits platform, found that among businesses created last year that were using generative AI, 76% were doing so for marketing. Still, many economists think that in the long run, few if any occupations will be unaffected by AI in some way. EY-Parthenon estimated that two-thirds of U.S. employment -- more than 100 million jobs -- is highly or moderately exposed to generative AI, meaning those jobs could be altered by the technology. The remainder, typically jobs with more social and human interaction, are likely to be affected as well, through tasks such as administrative work. And AI diffusion appears to be gaining steam. A working paper from the Center for Economic Studies, using data from the Census Bureau's Business Formation Statistics, found a \"substantial, discrete jump\" last year in applications for AI-related businesses, which could fuel the technology's spread. The paper also showed that businesses originating from AI-related applications over the years had greater potential than others for job creation, payroll and revenue. Putting this together, \"we believe that there is potential for these AI startups to have an impact on our economy in the near future,\" said Can Dogan, an associate professor of economics at Radford University in Virginia and one of the paper's authors. \"In general, existing businesses should find out what they can do with these technologies,\" he added. \"I think that is the key for wider adoption.\" Chris Jones, founder of Planting Seeds Academic Solutions, an education and tutoring business with nine employees and 100 to 150 independent contractors, is among those trying to figure out how to use emerging AI technologies. Jones, based in Dallas, said he became interested in using AI at his company in 2021 or 2022 but that he \"never had the full focus to pinpoint how AI could be incorporated into our business.\" He hopes to enlist a consultant soon to show the company how to use AI for sales, administrative tasks and program operations such as curriculum creation. He is mindful of the potential effect on his employees' jobs, he said, but cleareyed about the changing economic landscape. \"As a business, I need to stay afloat, because competition is real,\" Jones said. In Nashville, a driving force in pushing small and midsize companies to embrace AI is the chamber's chair, Bob Higgins. He has been talking to other business leaders, holding webinars and working with a Vanderbilt University professor who is an expert on generative AI. Higgins is trying to lead by example, too. At Barge Design Solutions, an engineering and architecture services firm where he is CEO, his human resources team has used generative AI to help create job postings that yielded more qualified applicants for hard-to-fill positions. He also uses the technology as a \"thought partner\" to prepare for meetings and create agendas. The ultimate goal, he said, is \"to help make Nashville this GenAI city.\" \"If you live in the fear of it,\" he said, \"I think you're going to be left out.\" #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on artificial intelligence AI for small business generative AI Allison Giddens chatgpt (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

MSMEs are major contributors to economic growth, employment as well as exports. But they also have a significant environmental footprint and no real solutions to tackle it. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Green finance is one of the most fundamental requirements to make MSMEs more climate-friendly. Many small and medium businesses face challenges in raising capital to run and expand their businesses. So their challenge becomes steeper when it comes to raising funds to invest in cleaner technologies, energy efficiency upgrades and sustainable business practices. But now, fintech is working on developing innovative solutions for MSMEs to make the transition to greener processes. ET Online Register for the ET MSME Day 2024 here. “The solutions aim to simplify the process of integrating sustainable practices into business operations and make it easier to secure necessary funding. For instance, deep tier supply chain finance (DTSCF) leverages advanced data analytics to provide visibility into the environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of supply chains. This allows MSMEs to effectively demonstrate their sustainability efforts and access preferential financing rates while mitigating reputational risks,” says Raja Debnath, Managing Director, Veefin Solutions . Gurjodhpal Singh, CEO, Tide in India, says while MSMEs form the backbone of the country’s economy and are also important contributors to job creation, these businesses also have a significant environmental footprint, for which they require green finance. “It is one of the most fundamental prerequisites for making MSMEs more climate-friendly. Many of these businesses face challenges in raising the capital needed to invest in cleaner technologies, energy efficiency upgrades and sustainable business practices. Lack of access to affordable financing options is another key barrier preventing wider adoption of climate-smart solutions among these MSMEs,” adds Singh. MSMEs & ESG criteria Stakeholders say that sustainability has evolved from a mere catchphrase to an essential component in today's corporate landscape. Integrating sustainable practices into business operations is the key to achieving long-term success, as well as fulfilling our environmental and social responsibilities, they add. “Financial institutions today are increasingly prioritising sustainability as a criteria when allocating capital,” says Debnath. “Veefin’s DTSCF solution is promoting ESG compliance by enabling financial institutions to ensure sustainability and ethical business practices. Through DTSCF, there is greater visibility into the practices of corporate borrowers and their extended supply networks. By integrating ESG factors into their operations, MSMEs can identify and mitigate various risks, such as regulatory compliance, reputational risks and supply chain risks, ensuring that sustainable finance fosters the development of responsible businesses.” Stakeholders say MSMEs that are working in tandem and prioritising sustainable practices are more likely to access funding on favourable terms. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on MSME MSME Day FINTECH companies green finance sustainability veefin solutions (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "Ajay Thakur, former Head, BSE SME & Startup India can soon transform into a $10 trillion economy if its skills and entrepreneurship are channelised in the right direction, Ajay Thakur, former Head, BSE SME & Startup said, adding that SMEs are the engines of growth. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} In an exclusive interaction with ET Digital in Mumbai, Thakur recalled how convincing SME promoters to get listed on the BSE SME platform was an arduous task during his stint. Thakur played a key role in setting up of SME Exchange and Startup Platform in the country in 2012 and 2018, respectively. “At that point in time, no one was convinced that the SME platform would take off. All feedback was negative. I knew from day one that it would be a very challenging assignment. It took me 1.5 years to launch the SME platform. But I knew it was an entrepreneurial journey and slowly things fell into place,” he said. ET Online Register for the ET MSME Day 2024 here. In the past 10-12 years, Thakur met almost 40,000 SME promoters and spoke in nearly 1500 seminars. He started travelling to Tier II cities as well at this time. “I had many sleepless nights. In India, financial literacy is very low. SMEs are always worried about compliances. Though it was challenging, it slowly turned into an interesting assignment for me,” he stated. Thakur admits that initially he was not bullish about how things would shape up. But as results started showing, the sentiments changed for him. “When I got 50 SMEs listed, I became more positive. Positivity comes when you reach different milestones,” he says, confessing that they were “hard nuts to crack.” The fear factor, he added, got a lot of apprehension among them to get listed. “They thought listing would bring in a lot of compliances and notice from regulatory agencies.” From 2012, Thakur saw 505 SMEs getting listed on BSE and 495 on the NSE platform. Thakur says that the advantages for SMEs are clear enough. “I have met so many SMEs, they were over-leveraged. They were dependent on only one sort of financing–debt financing. This led to them paying a lot of EMIs every month due to which they were bleeding. They were looking for funds by which cash flows could turn positive. This would help to make their balance sheet healthy and without any burden on the mind–this could also reduce their debt,” he said. Such aspects would have other follow-on effects too. The healthy balance sheet would make the stock market valuation increase as well as lead to greater transparency. “When all this is in place, there is a better trust factor on the credibility of the promoter. Investors like to come and participate in the company,” he said. Talking about how the rise of SME IPOs in recent times is a good sign, Thakur said that a lot of such companies are seeing huge subscriptions. “SMEs are now finally coming forward and getting listed. How is value discovered in the market? It is when demand exceeds supply and this is what is happening on the SME platform. That is where we see returns happening, then liquidity flowing more towards that side,” he added. He, however, emphasised that an SME must soon look at transforming from small to medium and then a large enterprise. “It is not good for an SME to say that I want to remain an SME. Hence, we started the migration policy which said that after a certain time, one should be able to migrate to the main board of the stock exchange.” Thakur expects another 200-250 SMEs to get listed in the course of one year. He attributed this to growing awareness and more promoters coming forward. He also advised SMEs to be mindful of transparency, compliance and full disclosure when thinking of getting listed. “If this is not done, investors will not look favourably at the company. They will also invite the wrath of regulatory agencies,” he stated. Delving on how a lot of transformation was seen in SMEs post listing during his tenure, Thakur stated that the vision of promoters had undergone a sea change over time. “It was more myopic earlier, which later changed to a corporate approach. They tasted the success of listing and saw how people treated them. Even children who left them had started returning and joining them. The second generation came into the business. Everything around them started changing,” he said, the enthusiasm palpable in his voice. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on MSME MSME Day SME IPO BSE SME platform SME Exchange (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "Agencies Big automotive companies are hungry for low-cost, reliable domestic graphite due to international supply chain issues. Graphite is key to manufacturing the lithium-ion batteries that power everything from electric cars to smartphones. While China is the world’s top producer and exporter of the crystalline carbon, there’s been a push to grow a US supply chain. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Oakland-based startup Molten Industries is working to build it by relying on something that’s cheap and abundant in the US: natural gas. The company has developed a specialized technique to break methane into graphite and hydrogen, the latter of which can be used as a source of clean energy. The effort is funded in part by a $25 million Series A financing round led by Bill Gates’s Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV). ET Online Register for the ET MSME Day 2024 here. “This is at the intersection of two really important climate tech theme areas for us at Breakthrough: making batteries scaleable and more cost-effective to drive EV sales to grow, and on the other side, low-cost clean hydrogen,” said BEV Managing Director David Danielson. Big automotive companies are hungry for low-cost, reliable domestic graphite due to international supply chain issues, he added. Graphite is typically mined or made synthetically from fossil fuels, and China controls about three-quarters of the world’s graphite anode supply chain, according to data from mineral intelligence firm Benchmark. Higher freight costs like those experienced during the pandemic and China’s temporary export restrictions have raised concerns in the US and elsewhere about the risk of largely relying on one source of the valuable material. Boosting domestic production is a key priority of the Biden administration, which in 2022 invoked the Defense Production Act to fund the industry. To create graphite, Molten relies on pyrolysis, a technique that involves heating methane until it breaks into its constituent components of carbon and hydrogen. If there’s no oxygen or water present during this process, the methane gets split without any resulting CO2 emissions. Other pyrolysis companies exist but most create products like soot or carbon black that can’t be used in battery production. Those companies also often rely on microwave or plasma-based heating, techniques that can be very energy-intensive. By contrast, Molten’s reactor is like a toaster: It uses resistive heating, which is more efficient, according to co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Kevin Bush. Molten says its graphite will be cost-competitive with other sources. It’s also banking on the fact that customers will want a lower-emissions synthetic graphite than the kind currently on the market, which is made by treating fossil fuel-based feedstocks using a process that emits methane and air pollutants. The only potential sources of emissions in Molten’s process are from producing the natural gas it uses as feedstock or the grid electricity powering the pyrolysis. Graphite wasn’t a big part of the startup’s vision when it was founded in 2021. “Our original focus was just to make the lowest-cost hydrogen with the most energy-efficient reactor possible,” said Bush. “We did figure out along the way that we could actually make battery-grade graphite rather than just an amorphous carbon soot.” Molten has built a pilot reactor in Oakland and is constructing a full commercial-scale unit the size of a shipping container that Bush said he expects to be operational next year. That unit will be able to produce 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of hydrogen and 1,500 kilograms of graphite daily, he said. Whether there will be demand for the latter in the coming decades remains to be seen, though. Other materials like silicon, lithium and hard carbon may begin to compete with graphite as the default material in battery anodes, according to BloombergNEF. The shift could potentially halve demand by 2035. The market for hydrogen may also be challenging because of high costs to produce and use it and policy uncertainty, according to Payal Kaur, a BloombergNEF hydrogen analyst. “It’s a story that follows pretty much every market,” Kaur said. “You have way more supply than you do offtake.” #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on EV ev battery methane EV battery material (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

The logjam that’s been plaguing Singapore’s container port is bringing forward this year’s peak season for the shipping sector , spelling trouble for businesses in the city-state. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} The bunching up of container vessels outside one of the world’s busiest maritime trade hubs — caused by ships avoiding the Red Sea due to Houthi rebels ’ attacks — means there’s more cargoes trapped in shipyards for longer. That’s pushing freight rates ever higher, with no immediate end to the congestion in sight. ET Online Register for the ET MSME Day 2024 here. For the manufacturers and exporters needing to get their finished products out of the city-state, that means there may be little choice other than to hold on to their inventories longer than they’d like to. “The fundamental backdrop remains the same with higher peak season volumes coming” in a shipping market already seeing healthy demand, Jefferies LLC analysts led by Omar Nokta wrote in a note. “Congestion is a growing risk as peak season is underway amid a reshuffling of the fleet.” Bloomberg The Yemen-based Houthis have been attacking vessels in the Red Sea since last October, in retaliation for Israel’s assault on Gaza. The situation in the vital waterway has intensified from early this year, with a second vessel sinking after being struck. That had resulted in shipowners opting not to transit the Suez Canal and taking the longer route around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa. That means now they don’t get a chance to refuel or unload cargo at ports in the Middle East, leading to worsening congestion in the waters off Singapore. No Easy Substitutes A lack of immediate alternatives to Singapore in the region is making the logjam even worse. Nearby ports, such as Port Klang and Tanjung Pelepas in neighboring Malaysia, aren’t easy substitutes because they aren’t as well-connected as Singapore, said Jayendu Krishna, a director at Drewry Maritime Services. So outbound cargoes may not be able to reach their destinations on time if they don’t leave from the city-state, he said. Bloomberg Weekly mainline service connections — a measure of how many other ports have a direct shipping link with a given harbor — for Singapore were at 148.7 in the second quarter, data from Drewry showed. That’s nearly twice the number of Port Klang and more than three times the figure for Tanjung Pelepas. There are also considerations such as trucking and additional transport costs for cargo diversions, as well as possible customs clearance issues, Krishna said. “A return to normal trade patterns is increasingly unlikely during 2024 and diversions could potentially stretch out to 2025 and beyond,” Jefferies’ analysts said. Still, that’s not to say there’s no way out. Even if the conflict in the Middle East continues, container lines and businesses can adjust their inventory management practices. It’s also possible for container lines to start using alternate ports like those in Malaysia, although they will be limited by the capacity constraints in Tanjung Pelepas and Klang. And given the shipping peak season has arrived earlier than usual this year, it will likely end sooner, according to Jefferies. That means freight rates should start to ease by September, the analysts said. “If the problem persists for some time, liners will adjust their schedules,” said Drewry’s Krishna. “Therefore, eventually congestion will not be there even if the Red Sea crisis persists.” #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on red sea Singapore port shipping sector container ships Houthi rebels (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

The effects of climate change are evident through increased floods, droughts, heat waves and other extreme weather events across the globe. Scientists warn that if immediate action is not taken, the damage caused may become irreversible by 2030. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} One of the major contributors to global warming is greenhouse gas emissions from traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. However, there is still hope if we accelerate the adoption of zero-emission electric vehicles . The Auto Industry's Electric Shift Understanding the gravity of the situation, almost every major automaker including GM, Mercedes-Benz, Honda, and Volvo have announced plans to go all-electric over the next decade or so. This shift is driven by environmental concerns and the reality that oil reserves are finite, expected to be depleted within this century. EVs, powered by renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, offer a sustainable alternative. Governments worldwide are also enacting policies to phase out ICE vehicles and incentivize the transition to EVs through rebates, tax credits, preferential parking, etc. For instance, California plans to allow only zero-emission car sales by 2035. The stage is clearly set for electric vehicles to take over and dominate this decade. Benefits of Driving Electric Electric cars produce no tailpipe emissions, and their widespread adoption by 2030 could help limit global warming to under 1.5°C, a target of the Paris Agreement. Additionally, EVs can significantly reduce urban air pollution, which is currently exacerbated by particulate matter and nitrogen oxides from ICE vehicles. While most existing EVs run on lithium-ion batteries, hydrogen fuel cell EVs are emerging as an exciting zero-emission option. These vehicles use compressed hydrogen to produce electricity onboard, offering benefits like faster refueling and greater range compared to battery EVs. Overcoming Adoption Challenges Despite the benefits, EV adoption has faced challenges like range anxiety and inadequate charging infrastructure . While costs have declined dramatically over the past decade, EV batteries remain expensive. As a result, most affordable EVs today have a maximum range of 250-400 km on a single charge. Many consumers worry about running out of charge mid-journey. The industry is addressing these issues with innovative solutions such as portable chargers and swappable batteries. Charging infrastructure is also getting a boost with newer faster chargers and more charging stations being installed globally. Energy providers are collaborating with automakers to install chargers across gas stations, restaurants, and other public places. Increasing Raw Material Constraints The surge in EV production has led to supply chain issues for essential metals like lithium, cobalt and nickel which are crucial for lithium-ion batteries. Experts warn that demand for these metals may outstrip supply availability by 2030. However, alternative solutions are emerging. For instance, sodium-ion batteries made from widely available materials like manganese are gaining traction as a cheaper and more sustainable alternative to lithium-ion. China’s GAC recently unveiled a concept EV claiming a record 1000 km range, powered by a new aluminum-air battery. As aluminum is the most abundant metal on Earth, this battery chemistry can ensure adequate availability of raw materials for eco-friendly EVs of the future. The Road Ahead In India, falling battery costs, government subsidies, and new model launches have spurred EV adoption. However, most car sales in India remain ICE vehicles. Statistics indicate that electric car penetration is negligible beyond Tier 1 metro cities. To accelerate the transition, efforts are needed to raise EV awareness in smaller towns and to deploy chargers across highways and rural regions. Collaboration between industry players and oil marketing companies can leverage the latter’s vast network for setting up charging stations at fuel pumps. With increasing support from policymakers and most automakers now committed to electrifying their lineups, electric vehicles are poised to take centerstage this decade. However, sustained efforts are essential from both public and private players across the ecosystem to address infrastructural gaps and raw material constraints. Success on these fronts can enable EVs to drive us swiftly towards the destination of a greener and sustainable future.

    "article_content": "iStock India has the DNA of services economy, driven by the growth in IT and other services in the last three decades. The first half of this decade has been a nightmare for global trade. From covid disruptions to Suez Canal and Red Sea crisis, the trade has witnessed many operating challenges. The economic environment puts further stress on demand and as an outcome, global trade is expected to grow between 2020-25, at only half the average growth rate of previous decade. However, amidst this challenging environment, India has found its glory moment. The fastest growing economy in the world and now a favoured destination for new manufacturing investments , India has got everything right to launch the economic miracle, much like Japan did in 1950s and China in 1980s. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} India has an opportunity at hand, that can propel the country to become the second largest economy in the world by 2075 on the back of sustained growth spanning decades. Japanese miracle lasted for over twenty years with Japan growing at nearly 10% during the golden age of capitalism from 1950 to 1973. Subsequently, from 1979 to 2010, China witnessed three decades of growth averaging similar 10%. Both stories had three things in common. First, a favourable geopolitical environment. China entered age of reform and people growing up in 1980s were considering western economies as friends, much different from an anti-capitalism view prevailing earlier. Japan was witnessing unprecedented support from US, which provided aid and opened markets for Japanese exports, which further increased during the Korean War. The second aspect was government policies. Liberal reforms of China supporting manufacturing growth and the Japanese government were key drivers of development. Third and equally important was demographic advantage . The availability of labour in China and suitable demographics in Japan enabled economic miracles. Now, as we look at India, all these three factors align well. We are a friendly country which is being preferred for supply chain diversification and government is launching much needed reforms to drive manufacturing led growth amidst favourable geopolitical environment. With age and skill on our side, it truly is a perfect moment to reap demographic dividend and aim for $35 trillion economy in 2047. Unprecedented third consecutive term for Prime Minister Modi or Modi 3.0 is well positioned for taking economic reforms to the next level. There are many concurrent events shaping the Indian opportunity. As per a media report, in 2023, Morgan Stanley analysts noted increased labour costs, geopolitical tensions, and human rights concerns prompting businesses to decrease reliance on China as the world’s factory. According to Kearney's Reshoring Index, Chinese goods constituted 50.7% of US imports of manufactured goods from Asian countries in 2022, down from nearly 70% in 2013. Additionally, Japan, South Korea, and Europe are seeking new supply lines in the Asia-Pacific, providing another opportunity for India's growth in global trade in the coming decades. Moreover, as businesses increasingly adopt novel technologies such as Gen AI for smart logistics and optimise supply chain processes, India's leading position in 'AI talent concentration' on the Network Readiness Index 2022 signifies the nation's preparedness for this transformative journey. Furthermore, India’s climate commitments, including achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, adds to its appeal for countries seeking environmentally sustainable trade practices. The country benefits from a young workforce, technological expertise, a strong climate stance, strategic political alliances, government initiatives for logistics advancement, and a home market with a burgeoning demand. Furthermore, besides engineering a diplomatic triumph for the Global South in the G20 summit last year, India strategically positioned itself in something equally momentous on the sidelines: the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC). Once completed, the IMEEC, a cross-border ship-to- rail network, could enhance trade speed between India and Europe by 40%, establishing India as a pragmatic and agile global ally. From far east to west and south, India has everyone’s attention and capital is gradually flowing in to drive manufacturing growth. However, a few risks remain and the country must address them on topmost priority. As JP Morgan’s Dimon said, trade openness, less protectionism, regulatory transparency, and consistency in taxation will encourage companies to invest in India. Also, there is an urgent need to revive special economic zones which are not stifled by legacy compliances. Together with industrial parks and export-focused hubs, such dedicated spaces will accelerate growth, according to Kearney’s definitive 2021 white paper, ‘Shifting Global Value Chains: The India Opportunity’, prepared for the World Economic Forum. Further, India already has unique port side ancillary infrastructure in Container Freight Stations and right policy and initiative can help leverage them to drive India’s emergence as trading and distribution hub. Logistics is the backbone of economy and it has to be efficient to make manufacturing led growth possible. The government does recognise that and hence structural transformations are being brought about by the National Logistics Policy, Sagarmala Project and the PM Gati Shakti initiative. Technology enabled logistics framework, and integrated transport modes and utilities, will bring down logistics costs. At policy level, we have all the underpinnings for a world-class supply chain. The progress is already visible as India has moved up by six places in the World Bank’s Logistic Performance Index for 2023. However, a lot more needs to be done. A lot of Indian manufacturing is in the hinterlands and there is a need to set up dedicated export oriented manufacturing cities near the coastline and as much to enhance the rail connectivity of ports and manufacturing clusters. The plan for dedicated freight corridors (DFCs) is the perfect answer, however, the slow implementation poses a big risk to our development ambitions. The western DFC launched in 2006 is yet to connect JNPT to the north and we must ensure that new corridors don’t take that long from ideation to execution. India has the DNA of services economy, driven by the growth in IT and other services in the last three decades. It would be ideal to leverage that capability by promoting logistics service providers to focus on delivering most efficient services, while Government can facilitate by providing requisite infrastructure. Much like Europe, US and later Japan and China, India’s domestic distribution is dominated by home grown companies and they are all capable of shifting to multi-modal logistics on the back of robust infrastructure. The strong focus on technology places them well to enable partnership with manufacturers to build best in class supply chains. India is already an exporter to reckon with in iron and steel, heavy metals, specialty chemicals, agricultural goods, active pharmaceutical ingredients, generic drugs, electronics, and vaccines. The central government’s initiatives like Make in India and the export-led scheme of production-linked incentives (PLI) are gradually propelling other industries too. Backed by its Foreign Trade Policy, the government aims to increase India’s overall exports to USD 2 trillion by 2030. If we can continue to improve on the ease of doing business, there is no limit to the opportunity at hand. The government must bring in more clarity in interpreting land and labour laws, nurture a culture of R&D, and improve urban standards of living for expats. With its strong macroeconomic advantages, India stands to harness significant supply chain opportunities in this multipolar world and thus fully capitalise on the ongoing global trade restructuring. India’s moment has indeed truly arrived and we must seize it with manufacturing empowered by efficient logistics.

A naval force deployed by the European Union to protect vessels in the Red Sea needs to more than double in size because of escalating attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels, the head of the operation said. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Four EU vessels have been patrolling the waters off the coast of Yemen since February. In that time, they’ve provided “close assistance” to 164 ships, shot down more than a dozen unmanned aerial vehicles and destroyed four anti-ship ballistics missiles, Rear Admiral Vasileios Gryparis said in an interview on Wednesday. The Yemen-based Houthis began attacking vessels last year to pressure Israel and its allies over the war in the Gaza Strip. Their campaign has roiled global shipping, forcing many vessels to sail thousands of miles around southern Africa instead — despite the EU operation and US and UK bombing that began in January. A warning by the Yemen-based Houthi movement last month that it will target ships owned by companies that dock a single vessel in Israel has increased the risk for commercial shippers, Gryparis said. He was in Brussels this week to lobby for additional resources. “We don’t have that many assets and the whole area we have to cover is enormous,” he said. “I am pressing all the member states to provide more assets.” The US Navy has an aircraft carrier strike group in the region, including the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier and three warships, according to website military.com. Last week, the militants struck the coal-carrying Tutor with a seaborne drone, killing a Filipino crew member. The ship sank on Thursday. US and UK bombing campaigns have failed to stop the attacks and instead led to vessels associated with the two countries being targeted more often. The Houthis have warned of an expanded operation to potentially attack ships in the Mediterranean Sea, though they’ve shown little evidence they can hit ships that far away. The EU mission has a defensive mandate and any increase in the size of its fleet patrolling the Red Sea would be to enable the force to increase its geographic range, rather than adopt a more confrontational stance, Gryparis said. ‘Hitting the Houthis’ “We don’t believe that hitting the Houthis might solve the problem,” he said. “Some other countries tried similar actions some years ago and some other countries still do and we see that it is not contributing to the solution to the problem.” The limited number of vessels at its disposal has confined Operation Aspides to a small part of the southern Red Sea, near the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait between Yemen and Djibouti — a choke point where ships are especially vulnerable to attacks. “There are daily about 40 or 50 ships going up and down the strait so it needs a significant amount of ships to be able to provide this close protection,” he said. “There are cases where we are not able to provide this close protection but we try and cope with the volume.” Operation Aspides’ current mandate ends in February 2025, though Gryparis said he expects it to be extended. EU foreign service spokespeople didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on houthis EU Force Red Sea (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "iStock A realisation is dawning upon Indian garment industry that penetration in the Japanese market is linked to designing apparel strictly in accordance with their cultural orientation, style and ethnicity. It is no secret that one of the prominent reasons for India’s lackluster performance in the exports from apparel sector in the recent past has also been its over-dependance on few select markets like USA and EU, which makes Indian apparel exports extremely vulnerable to recessionary trends and downturn in these markets. In recent months, the declining demand, skyrocketing inflation and high level of inventory in these developed economies coupled with issues arising out of Russia-Ukraine conflict has very adversely impacted India’s exports from apparel sector. The need for market diversification in this segment has thus never been felt more acute. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Being the fourth largest garment importer in the world, accounting for roughly 5% plus of global apparel imports, Japan has to be the obvious first choice outside USA and EU. The advantage gained through zero duty access by abolition of tariff through India-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in 2011 hasn’t worked. To our dismay and disappointment, Japan, which was our 11th largest export destination for Indian RMG prior to India-Japan CEPA, did slide down to 12th position by 2020. Overall trade balance for all commodities also had worsened. In Japan’s overall garment imports of $25 billion, India is hardly a player accounting for abysmally low share of less than 1 percent. China has lion’s share in Japanese RMG imports. Though Chinese share has consistently come down from a high of 84% in 2008 to around 55% in 2022, yet it is still quite significant. This despite the fact that Chinese exports, unlike India, face tariff barrier of approx. 9% in Japanese market. India’s dismal show in Japan coupled with China’s dominant share has only reinforced the argument that the international trade is not all about tariff and the role of tariff in enhancement of exports is unjustifiably overhyped at times. The international trade is increasingly getting complex with each passing day and there are variety of several other factors at play, which are equally important role, if not more. To achieve the goal of $50 Bn apparel exports by 2030, the diversification to market like Japan is no longer a luxury anymore but has become a dire necessity. Let’s identify the obstacles and try formulating strategies to overcome those: Indian RMG exports are not in sync with the Japanese demand. The top RMG products exported to Japan are not the ones which are in great demand in the Japanese market. Only one among top five Indian apparel export products figures in the list of top five Japanese import items of apparel. This implies that we have not been focusing on the right areas. In sharp contrast, Chinese RMG exports to Japan are more or less aligned to the Japanese demand and their apparel export items are mostly the ones which are in great demand in Japan. India should follow two-fold strategy: The short-term strategy should be to focus on those products exported by India which have reasonably good share in India’s exports and have decent demand in Japan as well. Items like Knitted T-shirts and vests of cotton and other materials, trousers and shorts of cotton of both women/ girls and men/ boys would fall in this category. The long-term strategy should be on development and exports of products which are high in demand in Japan like knitted cardigans, jersey, pullover of cotton and MMF, Men’s or boys’ trousers of synthetic fibres and men’s or boys’ windcheaters of MMF. Extremely high level of quality consciousness and process orientation: Japanese obsession with quality consciousness is legendary. The land of Six Sigma and Kaizen’s fetish for extremely high level of quality and zero defect is almost unmatched in the history of mankind. There is need to establish robust Quality Control framework in India to gain confidence of Japanese Buyers. Nissiken’s MoU with the Textiles Committee is a welcome development. We require to co-ordinate with Nissiken to establish Quality Control labs across prominent garment clusters in India to audit and certify companies as reliable quality suppliers. Weakness in MMF apparels: One of the major stumbling blocks to India’s apparel growth story is low share of manmade garments in its export basket, quite in contrast to the global norm. This also has contributed to India’s miniscule share in Japanese imports. Japan’s import requirements is primarily in MMF and synthetic fibre garments where India’s below-par performance leaves lot to be desired. Schemes like PLI for MMG garments are expected to augment India’s capacity to manufacture MMF fabrics and garments by attracting investment in this segment, which will enable Indian industry to cater to the increasing demand of MMF winterwears and trousers in Japan. Take time to develop trust and gain confidence: Developing Japanese market is a long haul. Besides patience and perseverance, it requires compliance with prescribed processes. To build trust and confidence, all garment factories in India should be mapped for their quality standards and the information be shared with prospective Japanese buyers. Identified Japanese technicians be also invited to India to actually aid the Indian factories at the ground level to improve processes & methods and enhance work efficiency and effectiveness. Cultural orientation, style, design, ethnicity: A realisation is dawning upon Indian garment industry that penetration in the Japanese market is linked to designing apparel strictly in accordance with their cultural orientation, style and ethnicity. Indian designers should thus collaborate with Japanese designers and produce garments for this niche market. It has to be market based unique solution approach rather that “one size fits all” approach. Chain’s share is declining: China’s consistently declining share in the Japanese market (from a high of 84% in 2008 to 56% in 2022) coupled with major slowdown in the Chinese economy and consequent sharp dip in its exports provides Indian apparel industry a huge opportunity which it must grab with both hands. Japanese businesses minimum order quantity is relatively smaller which provides an edge to Indian garment industry which is predominantly MSME driven. There is great enthusiasm, excitement and zeal currently in the apparel industry to explore and engage with the Japanese market. This was more than evident in Indian exhibitors’ record participation in 12th India Trend Fair 2023 at Tokyo. Strategies outlined above combined with in-depth research of market and fashion trends, robust mechanism for regulatory, quality and ESG compliance, technological and R&D tie ups for aligning Indian standards and testing norms with Japanese requirements, constant engagement of Japanese designers and deployment of their technicians in Indian factories for process improvement and re-engineering can go a long way in building and establishing trust and do the trick for Indian RMG sector.

RXIL , a joint venture between the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and the National Stock Exchange, is promoting the International Trade Finance Service ( ITFS ), an initiative that aims to democratise the trade finance space by providing an electronic platform to connect exporters, importers and financiers across the world. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} RXIL Global aims to improve financing opportunities for Indian firms, particularly MSMEs that export. A subsidiary of Receivables Exchange of India (RXIL) — an RBI-regulated trade receivable discounting system (TReDS) platform that facilitates invoice discounting for MSMEs — RXIL Global says this facility will ease the cash crunch small businesses often face. Ketan Gaikwad, Director of RXIL Global, says they offer various trade financing products at competitive terms to help exporters and importers convert their receivables into cash, giving them liquidity. In an interview with ET Online, Gaikwad explains how the platform is a significant driver of India’s business growth and reputation. Edited excerpts: ET: RXIL Global says it will facilitate Indian MSMEs get early payments against export invoices through the ITFS. Please tell us how? Ketan Gaikwad: RXIL Global IFSC Limited’s ITFS is aimed at tapping global financing opportunities to meet India’s development needs and provide a globally competitive platform for a full range of trade finance services. ITFS is an electronic platform that offers a transparent, single-window financing solution for trade receivables from multiple buyers. It incorporates a competitive price discovery mechanism through auctions involving multiple financiers, resulting in increased liquidity and lower financing costs, ultimately providing substantial benefits to MSMEs. This online marketplace is aimed at meeting the financing needs of corporates and making their exports competitive. This platform will play an important role in arranging credit for exporters and importers from global institutions through factoring and other trade financing services at competitive cost. ET: How does RXIL Global's auction-based electronic platform contribute to achieving the goals of ITFS and fostering international trade flows? KG: India is poised to emerge as a global hub for exports, backed by an increased focus on the growth of the manufacturing sector and the digital economy. The latest government initiatives, such as Make in India and the production linked incentive schemes, show the thrust towards becoming a manufacturing and export hub. In India, MSMEs play a very crucial role by contributing about 34% of the merchandise exports, which stood at $450 billion in 2023. The country will be a key driver of global trade growth, which will almost double from $17.4 trillion to $29.7 trillion over the next decade. As many as 38% of global corporates plan to manufacture or source from India in the next decade. In my view, the ITFS platform will play a pivotal role in addressing the financing gap for exporters and importers based in India and elsewhere. It is important for MSMEs to thoroughly evaluate the terms and conditions offered by finance providers and choose an arrangement that aligns with their financial goals and business needs. RXIL Global will provide valuable insights into making the right decision. The export factoring market in India is underdeveloped and there is tremendous potential to promote factoring, considering India is emerging as a global export hub. The ITFS platform will play a crucial role by providing such options to corporates and small business units. ET: Can you share some insights on the financiers and financial institutions collaborating with RXIL Global on the ITFS platform? How do these partnerships enhance the trade finance ecosystem? KG: Financial institutions in India and abroad are actively considering participating on the ITFS platform, considering its regulatory framework and the value addition to the ecosystem. The platform will not only emerge as a financing centre for all cross-border trade with India but also attract financing options for trades happening across all global trade corridors. Pic: Ketan Gaikwad, Director of RXIL Global ET: Please outline the key benefits and competitive terms that Indian MSMEs can expect while availing early payment against export invoices. KG: While big corporations have multiple options and extensive finance teams striving to lower finance costs, mid to small-sized businesses find it difficult to obtain favourable terms. Furthermore, the processes and procedures required to perform cross-border transactions are time-consuming, and there is information asymmetry. Having access to various financiers will help them analyse risks based on each financier’s internal policies, access to information, risk appetite and without recourse to the exporters. Competitive bidding will also result in efficient price discovery. Digital ITFS links exporters, importers and financiers regardless of their location, thereby improving trade financing accessibility and liquidity. Buyers and sellers can achieve optimal price discovery, which is supported by a strong regulatory framework that minimises information inequalities and associated risks. Through this innovative setup, Indian exporters gain access to a variety of financiers who will bid on their trade through a transparent procedure. This inclusive nature empowers, say, an exporter from Surat engaged in transactions with a Middle Eastern buyer to access financing from a UK-based lender. This strategic approach positions the ITFS platform not only as an enabler of growth but also as a significant driver of India’s business reputation regionally and globally. With an increasing number of countries seeking alternative trade avenues to reduce dependency on China, India’s prominence in this sphere presents a gateway to new trade prospects for Indian enterprises. The digitisation of documentation speeds up the disbursement process, freeing MSMEs from long-standing growth barriers. ET: Building trust and minimising risk are important considerations in international trade. How does your platform address these concerns? KG: To establish credibility and authenticity, a comprehensive platform-level approach is adopted to address all pertinent concerns. RXIL Global minimises risk by doing checks like AML/CFT (anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism), vessel tracking, market intelligence, bureau information, etc, before the financier bids on the trade financing unit. ET: What are the anticipated volumes that RXIL GLOBAL envisions for FY 23-24? KG: RXIL Global is looking at facilitating trade financing of up to $50-60 million in FY24 through the ITFS platform. ET: Is there a minimum invoice amount for MSMEs to get their invoices financed at a global level? KG: None as such. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on trade finance rxil itfs rxil global MSMEs early payment export invoices small industries development bank of india receivables exchange of india rbi (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

NEW DELHI: India is exploring trade in local currencies with Tanzania , said Dammu Ravi, Secretary (Economic Relations) in the Ministry of External Affairs on Monday at a presser. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} \"We are exploring new areas of cooperation including in trade in local currencies. This is one of the topics discussed by the two leaders,\" Ravi told reporters in the national capital. Earlier in the day, the joint statement which was released after the two leaders' meeting mentioned that the two leaders expressed the desire to expand bilateral trade using Local currencies. They noted that the Reserve Bank of India (Indian Central Bank) has cleared the way for trade using local currencies -- Indian Rupee (INR) and Tanzanian Shilling by allowing the authorised banks in India to open Special Rupee Vostro Accounts (SRVA) of correspondent banks of Tanzania and that transactions using this mechanism have already materialised. \"The two sides agreed to continue with the consultations in order to address any concerns so as to ensure the sustainability of this arrangement,\" the joint statement read. Banks from several countries have opened special Rupee vostro accounts in Indian banks in order to trade in local currencies. Simply put, vostro accounts enable domestic banks to provide international banking services to clients who have global banking needs. The Reserve Bank of India last year put in place an arrangement, allowing transactions in domestic currencies to promote the growth of global trade with an emphasis on exports from India and to bring in increasing interest towards the rupee. At the invitation of President Droupadi Murmu, Tanzania's President Samia Suluhu Hassan is on a state visit to India. President Hassan was accompanied by a high-level delegation. With a view to further strengthening the bilateral relations and expanding cooperation across various sectors, the two leaders announced the elevation of the Indo-Tanzania relationship to the level of 'Strategic Partnership'. Both sides noted that the strategic partnership will help the two countries to jointly work on issues like Maritime Security, Defence Cooperation, Development Partnership, Trade and Investment among others. India remains a major destination for Tanzanian cashew nuts, pigeon peas, spices, avocado and other agricultural commodities. Both sides agreed to further revitalise cooperation in this sector. Both countries have a bilateral trade of $6.4 billion, of which India's exports alone amount to $3.9 billion and imports worth $2.4 billion in 2022-23. India is the fifth largest investor in Tanzania with about $3.7 billion in investments covering a range of sectors. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on india tanzania trade Tanzania reserve bank of india Samia Suluhu Hassan vostro accounts (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

After all, he has over 22 years of experience in the fashion industry — he was the chief design officer at Future Lifestyle Fashion Limited and design director for India at Robert Graham . Singh has now started Neometa , a global alliance of innovators and veterans in the fashion and retail segments. In a conversation with ET Digital, Singh, the founder & CEO of the company, talks about the future of retail and how to create visually stunning and commercially viable products. Edited excerpts: Economic Times (ET): How did the idea of Neometa come about and when? Anupam Singh (AS): The concept behind Neometa emerged from a desire to establish an apparel company that could cater to the evolving preferences of the next generation of consumers, departing from the traditional category-driven business model. Meta in our name signifies ‘multiverse explorers transcending ages.’ The co-founders include, Thomas Charles, Surendra Naik and Babu Mangatt. Neometa epitomises a global collaboration of creative and retail experts. With a collective experience of over three decades among the co-founders, we make up a formidable team poised to usher in the next era of brand storytelling and futuristic retail experiences. ET: What is Neometa's product or offering? AS: Neometa operates as a 'house of brands', with a strategic vision that combines diversity and consumer-centricity. We have successfully launched our genderless brand, NoBiY (Non-Binary), and are currently in the process of introducing the iconic women's jean brand Gloria Vanderbilt to the Indian market. Our aim is to position Gloria Vanderbilt Jeans as the foremost women's jeans brand in India. Over the next two years, we intend to establish 12 brand outlets. For NoBiY, our target audience is Generation X and Generation M, spanning individuals aged 14 to 28, effectively bridging the generational gap between Gen Z and Millennials. Our plan involves the creation of 500 NoBiY points of sale within the next five years. This expansion underscores our commitment to offering inclusive and fashionable choices to a wide range of consumers. ET: What is the opportunity for such a product in a country like India? AS: India presents a vast market for fashion with diverse sensibilities. It is projected to be a $350-billion apparel market by 2028, with immense scope for growth. We are collaborating with industry expert Thomas Charles Main to establish NoBiY as a global brand. Furthermore, we are redefining the Gloria Vanderbilt brand for the global stage, starting from India, with the guidance of fashion legend Mohan Murjani, known for his contribution in building Tommy Hilfiger. ET: How did the founders initially fund the startup and what challenges did you face? AS: Our startup was primarily funded through our own capital, supplemented by support from friends and family. Our most significant challenge was shifting away from a corporate mindset and building something organically. ET: Why are fashion needs different today and how has these evolved over the years? What role does technology play when it comes to fashion and textiles? AS: Fashion has become increasingly individualistic, with people seeking to express their unique styles and stand out. The era of hero worship is waning, giving rise to influencer-driven trends. Storytelling has become essential in product marketing, as consumers are more discerning and informed than ever before. Anupam Singh, founder and CEO, Neometa. We aim to merge fashion with technology as an enabler rather than using technology for its own sake. We use advanced technology in designing, backend systems, delivery processes and enhancing consumer experiences while preserving the essential human touch of artistry. ET: How is technology improving the fashion industry, and what are the areas of concern? There is a huge focus on sustainability. Where is Neometa placed? AS: Technology is enhancing efficiency in the fashion industry. While concerns about the social impact exist, they are offset by new opportunities. For example, a robot automating basic sewing tasks can free up individuals to pursue more advanced roles in fashion design. Technology enhances efficiency in manufacturing, streamlines supply chains, and improves customer experiences through innovations like virtual fitting rooms. However, environmental concerns, such as excessive waste and carbon emissions, remain significant challenges. On sustainability, Neometa is committed to achieving plastic-free operation by 2028. We are developing an internal sustainability programme aimed at recycling products into alternative materials without exacerbating environmental damage by consuming additional resources. We integrate innovative materials, sustainable production methods, and have a commitment to recyclability. ET: The company recently entered a partnership with the Murjani group for Gloria Vanderbilt. How has that partnership evolved? What is the thought behind launching NoBiy? AS: We are relaunching the renowned US brand, Brand Gloria Vanderbilt jeans, with a distinct emphasis on designs crafted by women, for women. This signifies a significant moment in which a global brand is undergoing a transformative revival, with its creative reimagining and global reintroduction originating from India, for a worldwide audience. NoBiY goes beyond being just a product – it is a brand with a story. We are building it like a series, where each product contributes to a larger narrative. For instance, if a consumer collects our series of tees over five years, they can arrange them to see the entire story strip come to life. ET: What are the expansion and investment plans for the brands? AS: Our immediate goal is to build a portfolio of our brands with a net sales target of Rs 500 crore in five years. Investments will be made in a synchronised manner as and when required. Neometa, along with potential brand acquisitions, aims for substantial growth while maintaining a focus on profitability. We believe that value creation will ultimately lead to higher valuation. As a startup in its initial financial year, we are currently prioritising building a strong foundation.

Founded by Kushal Bhagia and Aditya Singh, All In Capital is recognised for its founder-centric strategy and unrelenting dedication to aiding early-stage entrepreneurs. While the terms of the transaction were not disclosed, the Noida-headquartered startup will utilise the raised capital to accelerate its expansion efforts. Nawgati’s primary focus will be onboarding 2,000+ fuel stations onto their retail ops platform, Aaveg . It is a vertical SaaS offering that provides comprehensive oversight of each fuel station on a dashboard with real-time movement of transit time, waiting time, serving time, attendants deployed, and under or over-utilization of resources – enabling the users to make intelligent decisions backed by data. With this undertaking, Nawgati will further its reach in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities including but not limited to Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Kolkata, Bhopal, Chennai, Pune, Lucknow, Patna and Jaipur over the next six months. In addition, Nawgati envisions expanding its platform to include a wide range of fuel outlets, making it a fuel-agnostic platform. This includes not only CNG or petrol pumps but also electric vehicle charging stations. With plans to onboard 15,000 fuel outlets over the next two years, Nawgati aspires to take its innovative solutions to the global stage. Vaibhav Kaushik , Co - Founder, and CEO of Nawgati, said, in a statement, “This association will enable us to expand our services, enhance convenience for consumers, and empower 2,000+ fuel pump stations with our state-of-the-art retail ops platform, Aaveg. The B2B platform will enable our clients to become efficient, increase their top line, and decrease their bottom line. We are excited about the positive impact our solutions will bring to both fuel companies and end-users, and guide them through a convenient fueling experience.” \"The team at Nawgati has developed a revolutionary, cutting-edge technology aimed at providing ease of access and convenience in the fueling experience for both fuel providers and consumers. Since inception, the fuel aggregator has partnered with major fuel corporations and has demonstrated a promising future with expansion plans across the country. I am very excited about supporting Nawgati and its team’s vision of creating a seamless fueling experience,” said Kushal Bhagia, Founder, All in Capital. Nawgati’s offering, Aaveg, is built with a vision to streamline operations for fuel companies and stations, and has garnered attention from investors and industry experts alike. Since its inception, Nawgati has attracted funding from PIED Society ( BITS Pilani’s incubator), MeitY’s Startup Hub TIDE 2.0 scheme and from the Department of Science & Technology under NIDHI Seed Support Scheme. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on Nawgati Seed Funding kushal nawgati innovation fuel aggregator seed funding vaibhav kaushik aaveg Nawgati Fund Raise bits (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

Mumbai: Mastercard and IT major Bizom today announced a collaboration to extend a holistic digital supply chain financing solution to over 75 lakh micro retailers and 2 lakh distributors of the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Small retailers and distributors in India face several challenges including supply chain disruptions, inventory management, payment issues, limited technical skills and lack of access to capital, that impacts their business operations and growth prospects. According to recent reports, out of over 64 million MSMEs in India, only 14 per cent have access to formal credit. The partnership between Mastercard and Bizom will aim to address this gap and help retailers to grow their business. Mastercard Inc is the second-largest payment-processing corporation worldwide. Under the arrangement, Bizom will work with its vast network of over 75 lakh retailers and 2 lakh distributors operating in the CPG industry to automate route-to-market operations, with its best-in-class SaaS offerings. Mastercard will enable the adoption of digital payments for micro retailers and connect them to lending partners for easy access to credit. Mastercard will also bring its expertise in payments and provide retailers on the Bizom network with virtual card application that will facilitate frictionless payments and easy reconciliation. Vikas Varma, Chief Operating Officer, South Asia, Mastercard, said, in a statement, “Rapid evolution of the retail sector has necessitated digital adoption by small businesses to derive benefits like operational efficiency and business growth. With this collaboration between Mastercard and Bizom, micro retailers and distributors will embark on a journey of digitization that helps them get online, get paid and get access to capital. No one organization can solve the existing credit gap alone. So, it is imperative that we build ecosystem partnerships to bridge this gap.” Lalit Bhise, CEO of Bizom, said, \"We are excited to pave the way for the millions of MSME businesses like retailers, distributors, wholesalers and small manufacturers in Bizom’s network to gain access to formal digital financial products. Through this partnership with Mastercard, Bizom's digital trade credit service will extend instant financial support to these small entrepreneurs, helping them grow faster.\" Mastercard announced a global commitment to bring a total of one billion people and 50 million micro and small businesses, including 25 million female entrepreneurs into the digital economy by 2025. Mastercard works with partners and merchants across the country to drive acceptance and till date, it has been able to drive acceptance at over 13 million merchant locations in India. #sr_widget.onDemand p, #stock_pro.onDemand p{font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.28;} .onDemand .live_stock{left:17px;padding:1px 3px 1px 5px;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;line-height:18px;top:9px} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{margin:0 auto 0;} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc{color: #024d99;margin-top:10px;} #sr_widget.onDemand .crypto .live_stock .lb-icon{8px 6px 5px 3px !important} #sr_widget.crypto.onDemand a.text{border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;padding-bottom:5px;display:block;width:100%} #sr_widget.onDemand .sr_desc .text p, #stock_pro.onDemand .sr_desc .text p{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;} Read More News on small businesses mastercard bizom CPG industry micro retailers supply chain financing mastercard inc consumer packaged goods (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

    "article_content": "New ways of working are needed to survive and thrive in a fast-moving, technology-driven world. Recruitment can be a challenging task for HR professionals, with the ratio of candidates to hires often being discouraging. Using Think Exam's AI-based recruitment solutions, one will be able to identify candidates based on skills and personality, resulting in a significant increase in the number of shortlisted CVs and a decrease in the hiring ratio. In Industry 4.0, as automation and digitisation have started to upend many manual and routine tasks, HR has been encouraging the workforce to look at acquiring new skills relevant for new roles. It is important to have a sound mental health and well-being in the workplace as these may impact the individual and organisational success. There is a boost in the workforce, when organisations align their mission and vision with their people strategy. AI capabilities have become particularly critical in HR functioning. From planning processes and performance management to maintaining relationships, AI has not only unburdened HRs but is also making them more efficient and accurate in their actions. Fort Eben-Emael, in Belgium, was considered impregnable and housed 1200 soldiers. A German attack team of sub-500 conquered this fort in 32 hours. What is instructive is not the victory itself, but how the well laid out German plan unraveled during the campaign. The minister said there is a big shift in the psychology of the current workforce and the companies must realise it to leverage the shift effectively rather than just being ignorant of that. Entrepreneurs may always have something or the other, which is going against their wish, which is outside their control, and thus it can cause stress. The biggest challenge is the perspective of men on board, who are not accustomed to working with women in a ship. To change that Maersk says by 2027, it aims to have equal distribution between women and men in cadet intake from India. Humans delegating decision-making to technology is only going to increase as we start trusting machine algorithms more than our own minds. The gig economy is creating new opportunities and integrating an extended workforce in the ecosystem which includes talent from tier 2 and 3 cities. In dismissing and smearing him, the company relied on the hardball tactics that had driven its dominance of the market. In essence, life skills are a set of cognitive as well as social abilities that can help people develop more positive behaviour, in challenging or dynamic environments. Moonlighting is the practice of working on a second job outside normal business hours of the primary job. Today, we live in a corporate world that is much more cognizant of women’s needs. But these are probably the big corporates and forward-thinking companies, including startups that have been implementing such facilities and altering office structures and mindsets to cater to women employees.

    "article_content": "In the initial years, people struggled in understanding the impact of the new regime on their businesses, getting their internal systems revamped and training personnel to undertake the requisite compliances. To promote ease of doing business for small businesses and clearly distinguish between minor offenses and willful evasion of duty, the govt is initiating one of the major overhauls of the GST provisions after 5 years. \"The government has settled ₹33,997 crore to CGST and ₹28,538 crore to SGST from IGST as regular settlement. The total revenue of Centre and the States after regular settlements in the month of November 2022 is ₹59678 crore for CGST and ₹61189 crore for the SGST. In addition, Centre had also released ₹17,000 crore as GST compensation to States/UTs in November 2022,\" stated the release. The pandemic resulted in severe supply disruption across the globe, and as result the freight rates are much higher today than it was during pre-pandemic. The proposed merger of the two regulatory bodies may seem logical given the perceived commonality between the two – namely, regulation of economic laws and protection of consumer interests. In most companies, the accounting process of vendor invoices is structured in such a manner that the GST amount, which is ineligible for ITC, is not recorded separately rather the entire transaction amount is booked in the expense GL itself As per the current construct, GSTAT can hear matters in an appeal against the orders passed by the GST appellate authority or revisional authority. GST collections in September rose 26 per cent to over Rs 1.47 lakh crore, the finance ministry said on Saturday. Goods and Services Tax (GST) mop-up has been over Rs 1.40 lakh crore for seven months in a row. The gross GST revenue collected in the month of August 2022 stood at Rs 1,43,612 crore, up 28% on a year-on-year basis, the Finance Ministry said in a statement on Thursday. With this, the monthly GST revenues have exceeded Rs 1.4 lakh crore for six months in a row. The book recommends the policy measures required to reform GST hinging on revenue buoyancy, world-class dispute resolution, institutional strengthening, and enhancing the ease of doing business. The Circular also mentions non-compete fees, late payment charges by utility providers of electricity, water or cancellation charges levied by railways, airlines, hotels, tour operators as examples of payments made towards the independent activity of tolerating an act. People aware of the development told ET that most of the members of the group were of the view that the 12% slab accounts for about 8% of total GST revenues and can be done away with. Presently, e-invoice is compulsory for businesses with an annual turnover of over Rs 20 crore. In a notification issued on Monday, the centre said it has amended the rule on the recommendations of the Council. The GST Council, in its 37th meeting on September 20, 2019, had recommended the introduction of an electronic invoice in GST in a phased manner. The market value of the Indian skill gaming sector is around Rs 79 billion in the financial year (FY) 2021-22 and may reach Rs 150 billion in FY 2023-24. Perquisites provided by an employer to its employees always attract the attention of the tax authorities. Service provided by an employee to an employer is exempted from GST. Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj told ET that the tax revenue growth was robust and the government should be able to meet its fiscal deficit target. He also talked about capital gains tax, duty on glod and more. Consumers may have to shell out more as several goods and services will cost higher from July 18 onwards with the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council approving rate hike to address inverted duty structures and withdrawing some exemptions. The draft, approved by the GST Council in its 47th meeting held last month, has incorporated many recommendations by the industry such as auto population of values and streamlining process of input tax credit and IGST settlement, and allowing negative values. This would mean that any IPL franchise owner gifting complimentary tickets to its employees will have to cough up GST on the value. KPH Dream Cricket Private Ltd, which operates an IPL cricket team under the title Punjab Kings, had approached the Punjab bench of AAAR for clarity on the matter. The GST law is driven by the recommendations of the GST Council, which is a body having representation from both Central and State Governments, thus promoting uniformity in law, practice, tax processes and standardisation of reports or filings. Caught between a perception that online games are nothing but a rich man’s gambit that only whips up greed and promotes gambling, India’s $2 billion online gaming industry oday suffers from a serious image problem. But GoM’s recommendation to levy 28% levy on the full value of consideration or the wagering amount would make the sector unviable and significant revenue leakage. As per the Terms of Reference (ToR) of the GoM, the GST Appellate Tribunal panel, chaired by Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, would recommend required amendments in the GST law to ensure that the legal provisions maintain the right federal balance and are in line with the overall objective of uniform taxation within the country. New Delhi, which raised the import duty on gold recently, is not looking at any further administrative measures immediately to clamp down imports. With the amendments notified by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), businesses have also been allowed to make tax payments on the GSTN portal by using IMPS and UPI payment modes. Businesses with aggregate annual turnover of up to Rs 2 crore in the fiscal ended March 31, 2022, are exempt from filing annual returns for 2021-22, as per the amended rules. “Enabling this would not only ensure that the input tax credit chain is intact but will also make compliances easier and ensure that the input taxes are not loaded into the cost of healthcare services,” the FICCI letter said. FICCI also red-flagged the recent recommendation of the GST council to levy 12% GST on bio-medical waste treatment plants, and 5% GST on Room rent (exceeding Rs.5000 per day). There have been hits — a total digitisation of tax compliance infra and e-invoicing, robust revenue collection, and near-consensus decision despite a politically charged environment — but some misses as well. \"Compensation was more an insurance against tax losses for five years (2017-22). But if it is continued for too long, it will lead to laxity in states’ bureaucracy. It will act as a disincentive in mopping up more taxes. The GST compensation to states should end now.\" The transition from a multi-tax ‘manual’ environment to a technology-driven, uniform and single GST framework has been an ambitious policy shift. GST Authorities can investigate affairs of taxpayers for a long period of 5 years and 9 months. It is common experience that GST Authorities calls for details and documents for such a long period and that too within very short time. Conscious of the immense contribution of the sector, the government has been taking many measures to provide a more facilitative environment for MSMEs’ growth. There is no doubt that the Government has put in its best efforts to clarify the issues to avoid confusion prevailing among taxpayers, however, there are many disputes that need prompt addressing so that litigation/disputes can be avoided. In line with industry expectations, GST has had a positive impact on the manufacturing sector by removing the cascading effect of taxes resulting in the reduction of manufacturing costs. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue for the month of June surged by 56% on an annual basis to nearly Rs 1.45 lakh crore as against Rs 1.4 lakh crore in May, revealed finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday. The first five years of GST have been a roller-coaster ride, impacted by two waves of COVID-19 that resulted in global lockdowns and supply chain disruptions. Whenever the history of Indian GST is written, the impact of technology in its implementation and execution would invariably be a major highlight. Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), the apex body of gem and jewellery trade in India, through a series of representations, had been seeking GST increase on cut & polished diamonds to 1.5%, GST decrease on grading and certification (GCS) to 1.5%, refund of accumulated ITC, etc. Quick Links Trending Now Hot on Web In Case you missed it Top Calculators Top Definitions Top Commodities Top Story Listing Top Videos Top Searched Companies Top Slideshow Top Prime Articles Top Market Pages Latest News Follow us on:"

The Supreme Court recently noted that the principle aims of the IBC are to promote investment, and resolution of insolvencies of corporate persons, firms, and individuals in a time bound manner. In recent years, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) has emerged as a vital instrument in advancing corporate governance practices in the country. Even though the I&B Code has upended insolvency resolution via CIRP, primarily focusing on stakeholder production, the minority shareholders' problems continue to be overlooked. The IBC has established a structured framework for resolving insolvency, encouraging collaboration between creditors and debtors to seek mutually beneficial resolutions. Before IBC's implementation, insolvency and bankruptcy matters were not governed under a single law and were addressed via several statutes. RBI's Master Directions on Frauds was introduced to protect the interest of depositors and banks from increasing instances of frauds. SVB's recent collapse has caused ripples throughout the industry, and many are questioning the legal implications for its clients across the world including India.

The summit aims to promote discussions on global web governance, standards, and cooperation through cyber diplomacy. System intrusion is a common threat that both small and big businesses face, says a Verizon report. It also gives some inputs on how companies can counter the threats. Cyber frauds are no longer limited to large companies as small businesses are increasingly becoming their target. It’s high time SMEs understand the importance of investing in cybersecurity. 70% of Indian firms have been hit by ransomware disruptions in the last three years and they keep rising. An operating system is the backbone of any computer. So it's no wonder that productivity can drastically increase when an operating system is secure, fast, and user-friendly. Raghunandan Koushik, regional sales director for India & SAARC at Fortra, talks about the cybersecurity landscape in India, what organisations need to do to ensure effective data security, and the role Fortra is playing in implementing data protection strategies and solutions to tackle seemingly unmanageable security challenges. Threat actors that get up in positions of authority typically do so via stealing information from a trusted employee of a company who had access to extremely sensitive material that might be exploited for evil purposes including blackmail, extortion, and reputation damage. After Covid -19 pandemic, cybersecurity has become an area of major concern for MSMEs. Here's how MSMEs can improve their endpoint protection. Technology providers must become more proficient at developing intrinsically more secure and resilient technology, designed with the foresight on how these devices will connect into networks that are likely crawling with hackers. The pandemic has led to increased acceptance of e-commerce platforms and digital payments, which has presented even more avenues to cyber criminals to defraud organisations. In a study by IBM, enterprises deploying over 50 cybersecurity tools ranked themselves 8% lower in their ability to detect threats than companies with fewer toolsets. While we are focusing on digital tenets of an organization, we should not forget that effective cybersecurity is also an essential enabler of digital transformation. The reason the biggest source of insider threats is still the massive, despite decades of trying to curb it is because it needs a systematic re-engineering of human nature. Hackers are out to exploit vulnerable computers as millions across the world continue to work from home. For cybersecurity firms, this is a sweepstakes moment. The real challenge in the world of employees working from their own homes is not the slack in productivity or the threat of transmission of the virus, but cybersecurity.

Despite the advances in technology, artificial intelligence has not grown a sense of humour. That is no laughing matter. The critical juncture when AI is taking over the world slowly, a proactive approach and good understanding of Generative AI is required from leadership -- CEOs & CIOs. ​​​​The future of AI interaction lies in the ability of these agents to serve not merely as conversational partners but as comprehensive guides and copilots. With the advent of cutting-edge technologies such as Gen AI, cloud gaming, 5G, and XR, the gaming industry in India is growing rapidly. NFTFN is an order-book-based NFT Perpetual DEX designed to empower traders with Long and Short positions on the NFT market through indexes. Fujifilm says India is a high growth market beyond traditional markets like the US and Japan. With new launches and the possibility to manufacture in India, the company is looking to cement its place in the country. It’s time India starts focusing on developing a truly world-class AI infrastructure in the country to reap its dividends, says the Dean of Oxford University's Said Business School. The recent rally in Bitcoin can potentially boost investor confidence and fuel further exploration and innovation within the broader ecosystem like NFT. Blockchain technology extends far beyond cryptocurrencies, encompassing smart contracts that automate and secure agreements, DeFi platforms that provide alternative financial services, and NFTs that revolutionise digital ownership. Against the backdrop of post-COVID dynamics, the Indian SaaS sector is positioned as a key player in driving digital transformation, with a multitude of factors shaping its future. A recent Adobe research shows that Indian brands are yet to fully embrace generative AI. The Asia-Pacific analysis covered a sample of 5,027 consumers and 1,877 marketing and customer experience professionals. The Tata Sons Chairman believes that AI will not replace jobs but fuel more jobs in the country. By relying solely on intuition and gut feelings when making critical business decisions, MSMEs are missing out on the factual insights derived from data analysis.

Beyond tax credits, if revenues as reported in return of income as compared to revenues reflected in Form 26AS are short and credits are taken as per Form 26AS, it becomes a fit case for under-reporting of income during tax scrutiny.

As African nations overcome long-standing social and political misconceptions, the continent is poised to unlock its immense economic potential, offering a wealth of opportunities for strategic investors and businesses prepared to navigate this dynamic market. The U.S. and India are forging deeper strategic ties, with mutual concerns about an ascendant China in the Indo-Pacific region, even though India has maintained its close relationship with Russia despite its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Global supply chains are diversifying away from China for rare earths used in products like electric vehicles and wind turbines. Companies are building facilities to reduce the West's dependence on Chinese imports. Eric Chan, a former satellite and robot code writer, founded a durian company in Malaysia.

It's critical for every member of the exporting community to be aware of the provisions and the latest updates of this law. The post-export EPCG duty credit scrip scheme is a popular programme of the DGFT under which the basic customs duty paid on capital goods is remitted in the form of freely transferable duty credit scrips (DCSs). The Commerce Ministry initiated post-shipment credit as a short-term trade finance solution to help exporters tide over their working capital requirements for the time between dispatching goods and receiving payment from overseas buyers. Non-payment is perhaps the biggest issue exports face after shipping goods to buyers. Following certain key guidelines can improve the chances of exports minimising this risk to a large extent. The key benefit of the scheme is that it gives rebates on Customs and Central Excise chargeable on any imported or excisable materials used in the manufacture of goods meant for export. Amended Technology Upgradation Scheme (ATUFS) provides invaluable support to an apparel manufacturer and exporter in upgrading his production technology to an international benchmark and / or scaling up to meet increased order requirements.

The logistics policy will seek to ensure that more weight is thrown behind the existing PM Gati Shakti master plan, which is in early stages of being implemented. The plan also includes raising the share of railways in overall freight movement to 40% from around 28% now to bring down costs and increase efficiency.

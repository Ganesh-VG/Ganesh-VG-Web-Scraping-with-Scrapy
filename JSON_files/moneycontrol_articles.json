Invest Now International market is a global system of buying or selling goods and services outside of the buyer’s or seller’s home country. Geographically, it could be defined as the market outside the international borders of a company’s country of citizenship, or simply a region where a company conducts business that is outside the territorial boundaries of its home country. The trade across borders allows companies to expand their markets and access goods and services that otherwise may not have been available domestically. Selling in foreign markets involves dealing with diverse languages, laws, cultures, rules, regulations and requirements. Exporting goods is often the first step to entering a foreign market - which can lead to setting up the business presence in a country other than the company’s home country. Companies adopt marketing on a worldwide scale to reach global objectives by reconciling global operational differences, similarities, and opportunities. Global stock market indices such as S More The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 15.57 points, or 0.04%, to 39,150.33, the S&P 500 lost 8.55 points, or 0.16%, to 5,464.62 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 32.23 points, or 0.18%, to 17,689.36. The dollar firmed, as higher U.S. yields widened differentials with non-dollar rates that are trending lower. It drew closer to the 160 yen area that prompted Tokyo to intervene in late April to support its currency. Nvidia overtook Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company, ending the day with a market capitalization of $3.22 trillion. Megacaps Apple and Microsoft rebounded from early losses to end 1.97% and 1.31% higher respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 57.94 points, or 0.15%, to 38,589.16. The S&P 500 lost 2.14 points, or 0.04%, at 5,431.6 and the Nasdaq Composite added 21.32 points, or 0.12%, at 17,688.88. The dollar gained ground against a basket of world currencies as the Fed's hawkishness and possibility of a Europe-China tariff war sent European stocks sharply lower. The Fed's March projections included three quarter-percentage-point reductions. The U.S. central bank, in a statement at the end of its June 11-12 meeting, also said it left its policy rate unchanged, as expected. Benchmark Treasury yields extended their decline ahead of the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 87.18 points, or 0.22%, to 38,798.99, the S&P 500 lost 5.97 points, or 0.11%, to 5,346.99 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 39.99 points, or 0.23%, to 17,133.13. Benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose early and reached fresh intraday record highs, but then they retreated as technology stocks dipped. Technology stocks led advances among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, followed by equities in communications and industrials sectors. Consumer staples stocks were the biggest losers. A glitch at the New York Stock Exchange had triggered massive swings in the shares of Berkshire Hathaway and Barrick Gold . Trading in at least 60 NYSE-listed stocks were halted due to the volatility, before the bourse fixed the technical issue and activity resumed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 574.84 points, or 1.51%, to 38,686.32, the S&P 500 gained 42.03 points, or 0.80%, to 5,277.51 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.06 points, or 0.01%, to 16,735.02. Investors also digested data showing the economy had grown slower than previously expected in the first quarter. A separate report showed weekly jobless claims rose more than expected. The Dow fell more than 1% and hit its lowest level in nearly a month. All of the S&P 500 sectors ended lower as well, with rate-sensitive utilities among sectors with the biggest declines. Nvidia jumped 7% and boosted shares of other chip stocks as traders returned from a holiday-extended weekend. An index of semiconductors rose 1.9%. That was the last time share trades in New York settled in a single day, as they will from Tuesday under new Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The Commerce Department said new orders for key U.S.-manufactured capital goods rebounded more than expected in April while the University of Michigan reported that consumers' inflation expectations improved in late May after deteriorating early in the month. For the week, the Dow dropped 2.34%, the S&P edged up 0.03% and the Nasdaq gained 1.41%. Nvidia Corp's shares rose over 4% in extended trading after the megacap chipmaker forecast quarterly revenue above estimates. All three major U.S. indexes advanced and the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq reached all-time closing highs in advance of Nvidia Corp's quarterly results and in anticipation of the release of the minutes U.S. Federal Reserve's most recent monetary policy meeting, both expected on Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the three major U.S. stock indexes with a boost from chips, as Nvidia Corp advanced ahead of its closely watched earnings report, expected on Wednesday. Data on Wednesday showed cooling consumer price inflation, although that was offset on Thursday by news that U.S. jobless claims fell in the latest week and by figures showing U.S. import prices increased 0.9% last month. Early gains in equities dissipated throughout the day, however, with the three major indexes closing slightly lower. All three indexes hit intraday record highs with technology stocks leading the charge. The blue-chip Dow drew closer to the 40,000 milestone. Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd. All rights reserved.

Invest Now Humans adapt to new situations, so when the Covid-19 lockdown threw up work-from-home solutions most of us got cracking on creating comfortable spaces for ourselves to work in peace amid family-fuelled chaos. Backdrops of rooms in Zoom calls suddenly got all-too-interesting as we wondered what Elizabeth Wurtzel’s Prozac Nation was doing next to Sid Shapira’s Danny Dog: A Rescue Dog Finds His Forever Home on that stern, no-nonsense veep's bookshelf or why the six-foot grizzly-bearish operations head chose a light pink ceramic owl planter for his Syngonium plant. None of us is also likely to forget the s*x toy (that's what it looked like) making international news when a woman discussing unemployment during the pandemic forgot to remove it from a shelf behind her during a BBC Wales online interview. On a serious note, the anxiety over the deadly pandemic was palpable, coupled with layoff worries and mental-health concerns as families huddled together for weeks under one roof. But mercifully, creativity and quick-thinking won the day for a few millennials we know, many of whom are now happily tripping back to their offices. Fantastic flexibility When lockdown began, the first thing Dipttii Khanna, 41, founder of Mumbai-based Dipttii Khanna Designs, did was create a special table for remote work and called it \"Desky.\" Based on the alphabet, Desky was personalized for each individual. It gave her the flexibility to work from any corner of the house as it could be carried around easily, “ensuring convenience and productivity.” Dipttii Khanna (Photo courtesy: Dipttii Khanna Designs) Rohini Bagla, 40, founder of Mumbai’s Studio Rohini Bagla, too, quickly realised how important it was to give her family some space. As she and her husband worked remotely and their two children studied online, each person was allocated a separate room with functional workspaces. “We opted for folding tables.” While some of the furniture, such as beds and wardrobes, remained fixed in place, desks were mounted on walls for maximum space and convenience. Keen to create an environment that was not just functional but also aesthetically pleasing, she decorated each room with plants and interesting, colourful accessories and holders. That “brought a sense of order and positivity within the home. The brightness brought us joy, ensuring that the atmosphere remained uplifting rather than gloomy.” All this while, Mehul Raja, now 43, chief marketing officer of online education company Imarticus Learning, was figuring out the three essentials of WFH - a comfortable chair, a good desk, and a reliable internet connection. The latter was of course the “biggest challenge” because iffy connectivity forced him to switch his internet partner twice in the first month. Convinced that getting comfortable at home would make the return to work somewhat agonising, especially as he got used to spending more time with his daughter, then three years old, and wife, Raja gave the space an office-separated-from-home feel with plants and art (works of advertising stalwarts for brand campaigns). Not without its drawbacks Of course, those pain points were obvious. Architect and urban planner Virat V. Bhute, 30, associate manager, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd, found space too limited in his 2BHK apartment. His computer system fitted on a short, narrow table, forcing him to sit on the floor. The long hours resulted in neck pain, literally and absolutely. With a highly collaborative and hands-on role, he found it challenging to perform effectively in a WFH setup as the nature of his work involved extensive site visits, direct interactions with clients and stakeholders, and on-site assessments. Lack of clear boundaries between working and non-working hours set by the office added to the challenge. “Being confined to one place without any social environment made it a depressing and monotonous period.” Disruption in daily routines led to sleepless nights. The workload felt “overwhelming,” leaving Bhute exhausted and mentally drained. Excessive anxiety and pressure to meet work deadlines made him lose track of cigarette consumption patterns. “Constant fatigue was evident through shortness of breath and overall exhaustion.” Khanna also found it taxing to manage projects with “just Zoom calls and virtual meetings. “We were stuck to only designing and not executing for that moment.”One of the advantages, however, for her was that there was a lot of personal insight to “create a lot of designs, which we executed post-lockdown.” Back to business Since she didn’t have a permanent work-from-home setup, Khanna’s transition back to office had no major impact. “The household remained unaffected, maintaining its usual routine. The only element that shifted was my portable work-from-home desk, which could easily be relocated from one spot to another. Therefore, the absence of a permanent work-from-home arrangement did not disrupt anyone's daily life,” she says. (Photo by Pulkit Sehgal; Courtesy Dipttii Khanna Designs) Formal office environments, she feels, create more opportunities for brainstorming and smooth coordination. “Although, I was able to save time on commuting and could be more flexible with my schedule during WFH, it was also challenging to balance work and family responsibilities. My family members had to get used to me being around all the time, which took some adjustment.” It was smooth sailing to the workplace for Bagla. \"The spaces we created at home were flexible with furniture that could be folded and tucked away neatly. Some pieces are still being used and are now a part of the system,” she says. At the moment Bhute is happy to get off the floor and allow his “office to only exploit me during working hours. I can have a good night's sleep and enjoy a good social environment as and when I want,” he says. One of his takeaways from WFH is that India has a critical need for proper protocols and guidelines for remote work to prevent employee exploitation and prioritise their health and well-being. “WFH arrangements may be well-suited for the IT sector, but might not be feasible or effective for sectors that rely heavily on on-site labour and employee presence for development and operations.” Raja is happy that his home office has been dismantled, giving his daughter abundant space to run around and play in. “I learnt a lot from the lockdown and WFH experience. I know now that while I am capable of working effectively from anywhere, it is also important for me to have a dedicated workspace and to set boundaries between work and family time,” he says. Adapting to changes Then there’s the question of changes post Covid-19 Khanna’s clients going in for home renovations are making a conscious effort to address the aspects they found missing in their homes during the lockdown period. There is a heightened focus on home planning with dedicated areas for study, home offices and library spaces and an emphasis on ample open spaces, she adds. Balconies have become something of a trend, an attempt to make outdoor spaces and greenscapes an extension of homes. She feels this shift marks “a significant change in the overall design approach, reflecting the evolving priorities and preferences of homeowners.” Bagla is encouraging her clients to use work tables or concealed setups in rooms to accommodate laptops, notebooks for scribbling and books to read. After Covid, everyone, she says, has some sort of workspace at home. All said and done, the world has learnt valuable lessons during this turbulent period, especially about the importance of sustainability and wise utilisation of resources. “We found ourselves engaging in various tasks independently, aligning with the ongoing campaign for self-sufficiency. Through this experience, we discovered an untapped potential within ourselves — that, when channeled effectively, enables us to achieve far more than we could have imagined. “The WFH situation during the lockdown fostered a newfound sense of patience and understanding among individuals. With everyone sharing living spaces 24/7, it necessitated constant adjustment and adaptation. Consequently, people embraced patience and a sense of calmness. This organic process of adaptation and coexistence had a remarkable effect, enhancing understanding and strengthening familial bonds,” Bagla concludes. #trending_election_widget{ width: 930px; margin: 20px auto 20px; padding: 15px 25px 15px 20px; background: #F7F8FB; } #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll{ max-height: 93px; overflow-y:auto; scrollbar-color: #d5e0e5 transparent !important; scrollbar-width: thin; scrollbar-height: thin;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel{ width:100%; margin:5px auto 0 0; } #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel{text-align:center;display: flex;flex-wrap: wrap;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a{ white-space: nowrap;text-wrap: nowrap;padding:8px 15px;border:1px solid #CECECE;border-radius: 20px;margin:5px 4px;height:36px;text-decoration: none;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a:hover, #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a:focus{outline:none;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel .slick-slide{ margin:10px 3px;text-align: left;width: auto;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a span{font:400 13px \"Lato\", sans-serif;color:#333333;display: block;text-transform: capitalize;} #trending_election_widget .lhs_txt{display: inline-block;font:900 20px/24px \"Lato\", sans-serif;color:#000;text-transform: uppercase;padding-bottom: 12px; border-bottom: 3px solid #CECECE;width:100%;} #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll::-webkit-scrollbar {height:6px; width:6px; background-color: transparent; border-radius:5px;} #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {background-color: #d5e0e5; border-radius:5px;} @media screen and (max-width:980px){ #trending_election_widget{width:auto; padding: 15px 12px 5px 12px;margin: 10px auto 20px;} #trending_election_widget .lhs_txt{font:700 16px/19px \"Lato\", sans-serif;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a span{font:400 11px/10px \"Lato\", sans-serif;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a{padding:8px 12px;height:auto;} #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll{max-height: 118px;} #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll::-webkit-scrollbar { width:9px;} } Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

Invest Now Bond investments generally come with clearly defined time-frame. Though some bonds are listed and traded in secondary market, in most cases, you have to be prepared to hold on to your investments till maturity. That makes many individuals to frown at the idea of investing in long-term fixed income investments, including bonds, public provident fund (PPF) and Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY). However, not many really understand that one should be more focussed on the residual maturity of a bond and not the tenure of the bond. Residual maturity is the time pending for the bond’s maturity. If the bond is issued for 10 years, then after two years from issuance, the residual maturity is eight years. Ask an average investor about investing in tax-free bonds issued by central government backed public sector undertakings (PSUs) some years ago, and the first thing you hear is long term – 10,15 or 20 years. But they forget that these bonds were issued in the year 2013. So the residual maturity of some of these bonds would be around five, six or seven years; the number of years remaining for maturity. These bonds are issued by National Thermal Power Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation, Housing and Urban Development Corporation, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, Indian Railway Finance Corporation. Given the prevailing tax-free yield in the range of 6-7%, these bonds could be considered by individuals who are looking to invest for five years and want to earn tax-free returns. PPF and SSY are also considered as long-term investments. Tenure of PPF is 15 years and SSY money can be withdrawn after the girl child attains the age of 18 and 21. But there is a way to take advantage of these options. For example, in the early years of career, one may find it difficult to save big money. But still an account can be opened in PPF. In the initial years, one may start with token investments. As one grows in his/her career, he can increase his investments. In the last few years, you can invest larger sums in PPF account and can be used as 3-year, 4-year or 5-year instrument that offers tax-free returns with sovereign guarantee. Same can be done with SSY and EPF. In case of EPF, individuals nearing their retirement can consider an increase in their voluntary contribution to EPF up to 100% of basic salary. We are not suggesting that you invest your entire (basic) salary in voluntary EPF as money is locked in till you retire, but a little bit extra on your part can help boost the retirement corpus without taking extra risk. Besides, you need to keep an eye on your asset allocation as well. In an ideal scenario, one should be taking full advantage of the investment options from day one, however, for most of the individuals it is not possible in real world to do so given the financial constraints. One can make the most of these investment options if he keeps track of the residual maturity. #trending_election_widget{ width: 930px; margin: 20px auto 20px; padding: 15px 25px 15px 20px; background: #F7F8FB; } #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll{ max-height: 93px; overflow-y:auto; scrollbar-color: #d5e0e5 transparent !important; scrollbar-width: thin; scrollbar-height: thin;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel{ width:100%; margin:5px auto 0 0; } #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel{text-align:center;display: flex;flex-wrap: wrap;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a{ white-space: nowrap;text-wrap: nowrap;padding:8px 15px;border:1px solid #CECECE;border-radius: 20px;margin:5px 4px;height:36px;text-decoration: none;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a:hover, #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a:focus{outline:none;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel .slick-slide{ margin:10px 3px;text-align: left;width: auto;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a span{font:400 13px \"Lato\", sans-serif;color:#333333;display: block;text-transform: capitalize;} #trending_election_widget .lhs_txt{display: inline-block;font:900 20px/24px \"Lato\", sans-serif;color:#000;text-transform: uppercase;padding-bottom: 12px; border-bottom: 3px solid #CECECE;width:100%;} #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll::-webkit-scrollbar {height:6px; width:6px; background-color: transparent; border-radius:5px;} #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {background-color: #d5e0e5; border-radius:5px;} @media screen and (max-width:980px){ #trending_election_widget{width:auto; padding: 15px 12px 5px 12px;margin: 10px auto 20px;} #trending_election_widget .lhs_txt{font:700 16px/19px \"Lato\", sans-serif;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a span{font:400 11px/10px \"Lato\", sans-serif;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a{padding:8px 12px;height:auto;} #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll{max-height: 118px;} #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll::-webkit-scrollbar { width:9px;} } Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

Invest Now Thanks to the rising awareness, many individuals have started buying health insurance, personal accident covers and overseas travel insurance, among other products. However, not many understand the fine print, especially when it comes to restrictive conditions. Exclusions and caps are clearly defined and by now, most individuals have a fair idea of most of them. But as insurance companies rely more on co-pay clauses and deductibles, insurance buyers have to be doubly careful. Co-pay clause is an arrangement where insurance buyers agree to pay a portion of the claim raised. It is generally expressed in percentage terms. For example, if the hospitalisation claim is Rs 1 lakh and there is co-pay clause of 10%, then the policy holder is expected to pay Rs 10,000. Rest is paid by insurer. In India, co-pay is also termed as co-insurance. For example, Senior Citizens Mediclaim Policy of The New India Assurance Company has a 10% co-payment rule. Co-pay may apply to all hospitalisations under a policy. In some cases, the insurer may choose to apply it to only non-network hospitals or for hospitals situated outside the home city or home state of the policyholder or treatment of pre-existing diseases. For example, Bajaj Allianz Health Guard policy defines 8 major cities as Zone A and rest of India as Zone B. Policyholders paying Zone B premium rates and availing treatment in Zone A city will have to pay 20% co-payment on admissible claim amount. This does not apply for hospitalisation arising out of accident. SBI General Insurance Company’s Health Insurance plan expects policyholder to share 10% of admissible claim amount for hospitalisation in a non-network hospital. An important point to note is other things remaining the same, an insurance cover with a co-payment clause will charge lower premium compared to an insurance cover without a co-payment clause. Deductible is a sum an insured agrees to pay when the claim arises. If a policy mentions Rs 5,000 as deductible and the claim is of Rs 1 lakh, then the insured is expected to pay Rs 5,000 and then the insurer pays Rs 95,000. As a rule of thumb, other things remaining the same, higher the deductible amount, lower the premium. Generally, motor insurance and overseas travel insurance covers come with deductibles. For example, on Travel Guard policy of TATA AIG General Insurance –silver plan for an individual aged between 0.6 to 70 years and sum assured of US dollar 50,000 for accidental and sickness medical expenses reimbursement cover, deductible of US dollar 100 will apply. Health Insurance top-up plans come with a deductible threshold. Top-up health insurance plan kicks in after the basic sum insured is exhausted. For example, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company, under Health Booster plan offer to pay claims above Rs 3 lakh. And it offers sum assured of Rs 5 lakh to 50 lakh. To put it in simple terms, if you have a health insurance policy with sum assured of Rs 3 lakh and you buy this aforesaid top up, then in case of a hospitalisation costing Rs 8 lakh, these two policies together can pay for entire claim. It offers three deductible options – Rs 3, 4 and 5 lakh. You can choose the sum assured and threshold limits (deductible) depending upon your needs. Again, higher the deductible limit you choose, lower the premium. The difference between a co-pay and deductible is that the deductible connotes the amount you have to pay first when a claim arises whereas co-payment clause divides the claim in two parts as per the predetermined arrangement, explained above. Co-pay and deductibles are aimed at discouraging insured from raising small claims or too many claims. #trending_election_widget{ width: 930px; margin: 20px auto 20px; padding: 15px 25px 15px 20px; background: #F7F8FB; } #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll{ max-height: 93px; overflow-y:auto; scrollbar-color: #d5e0e5 transparent !important; scrollbar-width: thin; scrollbar-height: thin;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel{ width:100%; margin:5px auto 0 0; } #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel{text-align:center;display: flex;flex-wrap: wrap;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a{ white-space: nowrap;text-wrap: nowrap;padding:8px 15px;border:1px solid #CECECE;border-radius: 20px;margin:5px 4px;height:36px;text-decoration: none;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a:hover, #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a:focus{outline:none;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel .slick-slide{ margin:10px 3px;text-align: left;width: auto;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a span{font:400 13px \"Lato\", sans-serif;color:#333333;display: block;text-transform: capitalize;} #trending_election_widget .lhs_txt{display: inline-block;font:900 20px/24px \"Lato\", sans-serif;color:#000;text-transform: uppercase;padding-bottom: 12px; border-bottom: 3px solid #CECECE;width:100%;} #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll::-webkit-scrollbar {height:6px; width:6px; background-color: transparent; border-radius:5px;} #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {background-color: #d5e0e5; border-radius:5px;} @media screen and (max-width:980px){ #trending_election_widget{width:auto; padding: 15px 12px 5px 12px;margin: 10px auto 20px;} #trending_election_widget .lhs_txt{font:700 16px/19px \"Lato\", sans-serif;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a span{font:400 11px/10px \"Lato\", sans-serif;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a{padding:8px 12px;height:auto;} #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll{max-height: 118px;} #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll::-webkit-scrollbar { width:9px;} } Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

Invest Now Anju Gandhi The property of a person must go to the legal heirs in accordance with the applicable laws of inheritance. By making a Will , a person exercises discretion in who will be the legal heir, how much share in the estate each of the legal heirs will inherit and also exclude any legal heir completely (in certain exceptions). Salient Features of a Will Will is a legal obstruction in inheritance of assets. By creating a Will we: a. Choose the beneficiary – one over the other; b. Ensure succession in an efficient manner The making of a Will can be a simple process under professional guidance and involves the following general but significant aspects: Executor The Testator (a person who makes the Will) can appoint an executor in the Will. The Executors are bound to carry out the directions of the Will. An executor is expected to distribute the assets of the deceased among the beneficiaries. Moreover, he is also authorised to collect and realise the estate of the deceased and pay the debts. The Executor is empowered to file a petition to obtain probate (proof) of Will from the court of law. There are no specific guidelines to appoint the Executor. The appointment is solely on the Testator’s desire. One may note that any person who is appointed as an Executor may refuse to act as one. If he refuses to perform the required obligations, he cannot be forced to do so. The number of Executors can be more than one. And even a beneficiary can be appointed as the Executor. A lawyer, a firm of lawyers, or a company can be named as the Executor. In case the Executor is incapable of acting or refuses to act as one, the Court appoints an Administrator at the instance of the interested persons/beneficiaries. Beneficiary Beneficiary is a person who is named by the Testator in his Will to receive the benefits of the estate . A Testator has the capacity to give his/her property to any person. It is however, important to note that such bequeaths should be above suspicion. For example, in a case where the persons attesting as witnesses were not close enough to a Testator so as to enjoy his trust and these witnesses were not independent but interested in the beneficiary under the Will, the court held this to be a suspicious bequeath. Witnesses There should be at least two witnesses to a will each of whom should have seen the Testator sign the Will. The witnesses should put their signatures in the presence of the Testator. Registration Under the Indian Laws, the registration of the Will is not at all compulsory. It is an option on part of the Testator to register the Will. As far as the legality of the registered and unregistered Will is concerned, the genuineness is at par. However, the registration of the Will has a number of benefits. So it is advisable to have that done. Any testator can execute a Will on a plain sheet of paper. After that he can have it registered with the concerned Registrar. The advantages of the registered Will are many. Once registered, the Will is neither lost nor can be destroyed or stolen or tampered with. If the Will is unregistered, there may be assumptions and disputes about its genuineness. When the Testator goes for registration the Witnesses accompany him. As per the practice and procedure, the Registrar examines the Will and obtains the signatures and thumb impressions of the Testator and witnesses. These establish the bona-fides of the document. Since the Will is a privileged document, it cannot be examined by any person. During the lifetime of the Testator, the Will can be examined only with his consent. Only after the death of the Testator the certified copy of the Will, maintained with the office of Registrar can be given after producing the death certificate of the Testator. In case the Will is required to be changed after registration, it is advisable that any changes in the registered Will are made only by way of a registered instrument by way of Will or Codicil (document amending an existing Will). From this point of view, registration of Will may be disadvantageous. That is since modification, if required, calls for registration all over again. Registration of will after death There is a provision under the Registration Act, 1908, whereby the Will can be registered even after the Testator dies. Such a Will, once executed by the Testator, can be registered with the Registrar by the Executor or the beneficiaries. To do this, an application can be filed with the Registrar along with the original Will and the death certificate. The Registrar is obliged to record the statement of the witnesses. After having satisfied himself about the authenticity, the official can register it. Note: It is important to remember that our Courts have seen many legal battles due to improper making, execution and witnessing of Wills and these could have been easily avoided by seeking professional help. The experts advice the videography of the execution of a Will in the presence of a family doctor and a doctor’s certificate confirming the mental health of the testator at the time of executing a will.

Invest Now The primary question that almost every investor has in mind is what instrument will get me the maximum rate of returns? But, is it the right question to ask? The basic tenets of personal finance advise individuals to start with introspection. One should start with one’s financial goals than looking for high paying investments. The financial goals clearly define what you intend to achieve and you can accordingly plan your journey—where to invest, how much to invest and set your expectations right. Clearly defined financial goals or smart financial goals help you make a sound financial plan and ensure better execution of the same to achieve your goals. Here is how you can frame a SMART financial goal: Specific The financial goal must be clear in the minds of the individual. Buying a house is a very vague goal, for example. However, if one says arranging down payment for a one bedroom hall kitchen (1BHK) home in a gated community in Mumbai Suburbs, then it makes more sense. Specific goals ensure that there is an emotional connect with the financial goals and such goals are more likely to be achieved. Measurable The goal should have a money value ascribed to it, among other factors. It helps the individual to understand where he wants to go clearly. Going by the example mentioned above, one would say that he would end up buying a home priced at Rs 70 lakh. The down payment at 20 percent works out to Rs 14 lakh. The money value lets you adjust your goals depending on the extent of money you saved and the changes in the price of the financial goals. For example, you may have a target of raising Rs 14 lakh but the prices go above your expectations, then the same need to be factored into your financial plan. Achievable The financial goal must be achievable. Sometimes the goals are not achievable in a near future. However one may want to use time on his side to make goals achievable. Goals that look not achievable for individuals with a very low-risk profile, may become achievable if some allocation is made to risky assets offering high returns. For example, in the above example, for an individual with a monthly salary of Rs 1 lakh and monthly saving of Rs 30,000, the goal appears to be impossible if one wants to raise the desired amount of money by end of the financial year. However, if the person takes a bit longer term, then his goal becomes achievable. If you have to accumulate a corpus of Rs 14 lakh at the end of five years from now and the expected rate of return is 12 percent per annum, then you should be investing approximately Rs 17,150 per month. These numbers make it achievable in the given context mentioned above. Realistic The financial goal must be realistic. If an individual with a monthly salary of Rs 1 lakh decides to build a multi-storied mansion in the plush localities in South Mumbai, then it would look impossible in the given context of high property prices and inadequate income. Only some miracle can help in such circumstances. Even if you stick to your goal of buying 1BHK, but try to achieve it in a short span of time along with other goals such as going on a foreign vacation and arranging down payment for a luxury sports utility vehicle, then it will become unrealistic. Time-bound The financial goal must be expressed in the context of the time. Each financial goal comes with a price tag. But inflation ensures that the price tag changes with the time involved. For example, in the above example if we assume inflation at 5 percent, then the same house will be available at Rs 89.34 lakh five years from now and at Rs 98.5 lakh at the end of the seventh year. If we have to write the abovementioned goal in SMART words then it would read: Arranging down payment of Rs 19.7 lakh for a 1BHK home in a gated community in Mumbai Suburbs priced at Rs 98.5 lakh seven years from now. Clearly defining financial goal makes it easy to draw a financial plan. A saving and investment action can be prescribed with more clarity if the individual knows what he wants. #trending_election_widget{ width: 930px; margin: 20px auto 20px; padding: 15px 25px 15px 20px; background: #F7F8FB; } #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll{ max-height: 93px; overflow-y:auto; scrollbar-color: #d5e0e5 transparent !important; scrollbar-width: thin; scrollbar-height: thin;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel{ width:100%; margin:5px auto 0 0; } #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel{text-align:center;display: flex;flex-wrap: wrap;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a{ white-space: nowrap;text-wrap: nowrap;padding:8px 15px;border:1px solid #CECECE;border-radius: 20px;margin:5px 4px;height:36px;text-decoration: none;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a:hover, #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a:focus{outline:none;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel .slick-slide{ margin:10px 3px;text-align: left;width: auto;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a span{font:400 13px \"Lato\", sans-serif;color:#333333;display: block;text-transform: capitalize;} #trending_election_widget .lhs_txt{display: inline-block;font:900 20px/24px \"Lato\", sans-serif;color:#000;text-transform: uppercase;padding-bottom: 12px; border-bottom: 3px solid #CECECE;width:100%;} #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll::-webkit-scrollbar {height:6px; width:6px; background-color: transparent; border-radius:5px;} #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {background-color: #d5e0e5; border-radius:5px;} @media screen and (max-width:980px){ #trending_election_widget{width:auto; padding: 15px 12px 5px 12px;margin: 10px auto 20px;} #trending_election_widget .lhs_txt{font:700 16px/19px \"Lato\", sans-serif;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a span{font:400 11px/10px \"Lato\", sans-serif;} #trending_election_widget .Electioncarousel a{padding:8px 12px;height:auto;} #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll{max-height: 118px;} #trending_election_widget .cust-scroll::-webkit-scrollbar { width:9px;} } Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

The first part contains an overview of the state of the economy, policy initiatives, estimates on expenditure and fiscal deficit. Part B contains the tax proposals - direct and indirect. • Income tax and customs duties come in Part B. The Interim Budget, conventionally, doesn’t contain any income tax changes. Over the years, Finance Ministers have used the Interim Budget as an occasion to present the government’s report card on the economic reforms and policies. During the presentation of the budget ahead of the new financial year, the government lays out the estimated earnings and spending during the course of the year. These estimates undergo change and revised estimates of revenues and expenditure are laid out in the following year’s budget. Any additional projections made in the Revised Estimates need to be authorized for expenditure through the Parliament's approval. A Cut Motion is a veto used by members of a legislature against a specific allocation in Budget proposals. The motions are moved on grounds of economy or difference of opinion on matters of policy or just in order to voice a grievance. If the motion is adopted, it amounts to a no-confidence vote and the government falls. A Cut Motion can be of the following types: Disapproval of Policy Cut, Economic Cut, Token Cut. Appropriation Bill is required for the withdrawal or appropriation from and out of the Consolidated Fund of India. It is a Money Bill passed annually or at various times of the year. The Constitution confers an over-riding authority on the Lok Sabha in the passage of Money Bills. Article 114 of the Constitution stipulates that no amount can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without authorisation from the Parliament of India or State Assemblies. Usually, after the presentation of a budget, an Appropriation Bill is tabled so that the government can withdraw funds to allocate. The Annual Financial Statement tabled along with the Union Budget shows the government’s estimated receipts and expenditure for the financial year. The receipts and disbursements are shown under three parts in which government accounts are kept. These are the Consolidated Fund of India, the Contingency Fund of India and the Public Account of India. It acts like an imprest fund at the disposal of the President to meet urgent unforeseen expenses, pending the Parliament’s authorization. The annual Economic Survey is usually presented a day before the presentation of the annual budget and it serves as the official report of the economy. The survey’s outlook serves as a marker about future policy moves.The Economic Survey is authored by the Chief Economic Adviser in the finance ministry and his team. The government isn’t bound to follow these recommendations and it only serves as a policy guide. In an election year, the Economic Survey is presented ahead of the full budget’s presentation in July. The government’s main earnings are from taxes—both direct and indirect. Direct taxes are the one that fall directly on individuals and corporations. Personal income tax, and corporate tax are the main heads of direct taxes. Indirect taxes are imposed on goods and services and they are paid by consumers when they buy goods and services. Customs duty is the charge levied when goods are imported into the country. Article 113 of the Constitution mandates that the estimates of expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India included in the Annual Financial Statement and required to be voted by the Lok Sabha, be submitted in the form of Demands for Grants. The Demands for Grants are presented to the Lok Sabha along with the Annual Financial Statement. Generally, one Demand for Grant is presented in respect of each Ministry or Department. However, more than one Demand may be presented for a Ministry or Department depending on the nature of expenditure. Disinvestment can also be defined as the action of an organisation (or government) selling or liquidating an asset or subsidiary. In the context of government budgets and fiscal policy, disinvestment typically refers to sale from the government, partly or fully, of a government-owned enterprise. Finance Bill is a Money Bill, as defined in Article 110 of the Constitution and is introduced every year to give a legislative backing to proposals made in the Union Budget. Once the Speaker has certified a Bill as a Money Bill, its nature cannot be questioned in a court of law, in the Houses of Parliament, or even by the President. Fiscal deficit broadly represents the amount of money that the government has to borrow every year to meet its expenses. In budget accounting parlance, it represents the difference between government’s total revenue receipts (tax and non-tax) and capital receipts such as recoveries and interests earned on loans given to state governments. A guillotine is a parliamentary procedure that is used to fast-track the passage of a Bill. Once the prescribed period for discussion on Demands for Grants is over, the Lok Sabha Speaker puts all the outstanding Demands, whether discussed or not, to the vote of the House. This process is popularly known as 'Guillotine'. Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) was introduced to address inequities in taxation of Indian corporations. The Income Tax Act contains a large number of exemptions, incentives and permitted deductions. This has resulted in the emergence of Zero tax companies, which in spite of having high book profits, were able to reduce their taxable income to nil. MAT was introduced to address such inequities. Simply put, the Minimum Alternative Tax or MAT is a minimum tax that a company must pay, even if it is under zero tax limits. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented an Interim Budget with fiscal prudence as the underlying theme. The FM pegged the fiscal deficit target for the upcoming financial year at 5.1 percent, a recution of 70 basis points from the current year's revised target of 5.8 percent. Tighter fiscal consolidation didn't take away from government's focus on capital expenditure as it hiked the spending on infra by 11.1%. The capex momentum will ensure that India's GDP growth is well insulated from any external shocks. FISCAL TIGHTROPE With the FY25 fiscal deficit target at 5.1%, the government made its intent clear that it will not deviate from the fiscal consolidation roadmap. The FM asked the rating agencies to take note that India not just met the fiscal glide path target but bettered it. INCOME TAX There was no relief for relief for tax payers in the interim budget presented on February 1, with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman leaving rates and slabs unchanged under the new as well as the old tax regimes. INFRA BOOST The government allocated Rs 11.1 lakh crore as capital expenditure for FY25, up 11 percent from the current year's Budget estimate. This will boost infrastructure growth and have a multiplier effect on other industries. TAX COLLECTIONS The total receipts other than borrowings and the total expenditure for FY25 are estimated at Rs 30.80 and Rs 47.66 lakh crore respectively. The tax receipts are estimated at Rs 26.02 lakh crore RURAL HOUSING FM Sitharaman said the government is set to roll out a comprehensive scheme targeting affordable housing for the middle class, emphasised commitment to addressing rural housing needs, and announced the extension of the Ayushman Bharat scheme to include all ASHA and Anganwadi workers. MARKET BORROWINGS The Centre will borrow Rs 14.13 lakh crore from the markets in 2024-25 in gross terms to finance its fiscal deficit of 5.1 percent of the GDP. However, the net borrowing is only slightly lower at Rs 11.75 lakh crore compared to the revised estimate of Rs 11.80 lakh crore for the current financial year. Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

Invest Now One of the most precious and expensive metals, gold is considered very significant in India and is also one of the prime investment options at the present time. Not just in the form of jewellery. but gold is also valued in forms of art and coins. Despite a continuous hike in gold prices, people in India continue to invest in gold on a regular basis. Gold prices in India keep changing due to multiple factors including global market condition and the strength of the US dollar, thus leaving varying impact from city to city depending on demand and supply in local markets. If you are also planning to invest in gold, consider taking a look at the following details. Before knowing gold rates in India, it is important to know the difference between 24-carat and 22-carat gold. While 24-carat gold is a 100 percent pure form of gold with no trace of any other metal, 22-carat gold has traces of alloyed metals like silver or copper and has 91.67 percent pure gold. There are several factors that affect gold rates in India including fluctuations in the global market to the strength of the USD, import costs, interest rates on banks' fixed deposits, economic stability, seasonal prices, inflation and demand-supply, among others. While high inflation rates increase the demand for gold and vice versa, its price also shoots up as with an increase in demand. Apart from a few global conditions, the international spot price of gold also affects the metal value of gold in India. Just like any other product, demand and supply also affect gold prices. With a rise in demand and supply for gold, its prices have also increased. Even as buying gold has turned out to be a secure form of investment in India, more and more people are engaging themselves in buying gold. With gold rates skyrocketing in recent times, it is important to take note of a few things before investing in precious metals. TODAY Silver Rate Per Gram/Kg Determined by a combination of factors including international market behaviour, demand, supply and inflation, among others, gold prices in India are indicated by the Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. and the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX). Factors that potentially affect gold rates in India are fluctuations in the global market, strength of the USD, import costs, interest rates on banks' fixed deposits, economic stability, seasonal prices, inflation and demand-supply. 24-carat gold is considered to be the purest form with 100 percent gold and no traces of any other metal. Auspicious festivals like Dhanteras, Makar Sankranti, Akshaya Tritiya, Dussehra, and Diwali are considered the best time to buy gold in India. It is primarily because jewellers offer a range of discounts on making charges. The purity of gold can be determined by checking the 'Hallmark' sign on the jewellery. Hallmarked jewellery certifies the claimed purity of gold and further engraves the purity level along with the name of the retailer to ensure that customers are not duped. In a bid to bring transparency into jewellery shopping, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has been designated to implement hallmarking of gold jewellery to ensure that customers buy the purest form of gold. Through this process, the proportionate content of precious metals is determined and recorded through specific marks such as the BIS logo, the purity of the metal and a unique HUID number. To ensure that customers are not duped and sold off with an impure form of gold that has a mix of other alloyed metals, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has been designated to implement hallmarking of gold jewellery. Beginning with the custom tax that the government imposes for importing gold into the country, it is followed by other taxes levied by sellers including the GST, making charges, and TDS. The fluctuation in the international markets largely impacts the price of gold in India. For example, any rise in the US Fed interest rate will result in money flowing into government securities and the banking system from gold reserves. India is one of the largest gold importers and sees a major impact with fluctuations in gold prices on global markets. Being the safest and profitable form of investment in India, investing in gold will not only come as an asset but is also considered superior to currency. It is one of the few assets that is tangible and creates a perception of safety among investors. Both purchasing and selling gold are very easy in India. Gold investment in India is popular and can be done through various avenues. These include purchasing gold jewelry, coins, bars, or investing in gold ETFs. Gold jewelry serves a dual purpose of adornment and investment, although factors like making charges should be considered. Gold coins and bars can be obtained from authorized dealers or banks in different weights. Alternatively, investors can opt for gold ETFs, which offer liquidity and convenience. The government also issues Sovereign Gold Bonds periodically, providing an alternative investment option. It's important to track gold prices as they are subject to fluctuations influenced by various factors. Proper storage, such as bank lockers or secure vaults, is essential for physical gold investments. Consulting with a financial advisor is recommended to make informed investment decisions based on individual financial goals and risk tolerance. Furthermore, the Gold Monetization Scheme introduced by the government allows individuals to deposit their idle gold with banks and earn interest on it. This scheme aims to put the idle gold held by households to productive use. However, it's important to note that gold investments come with risks. While gold has historically been considered a safe haven asset, its value can also fluctuate based on international market trends, currency exchange rates, and economic factors. Therefore, it's prudent to carefully monitor gold prices and assess the market conditions before making any investment decisions. Seeking guidance from a financial advisor or investment professional can provide valuable insights and help align your gold investment strategy with your overall financial goals.

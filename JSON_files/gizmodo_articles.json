    "article_content": "What wasn’t obvious about the new slimmer version of the PlayStation 5 was that each individual panel can be removed individually. Unlike the original PS5, the black bar running through the center on the new version separates each panel into four pieces rather than two. This means you can make interesting designs using Sony’s new “ Deep Earth ” collection panels. And hey, it looks a bit like the U.S. flag—and the Panama flag, the Laos flag, Russia, Norway, Liberia, U.K. Iceland, Nepal...—but you get the picture. We were offered the chance to look at all three new cover options launching Friday, so we had some fun with them. Each cover set costs $60, so unless you’d be willing to throw $180 at the wall to have a very odd-looking PS5, then we suggest you settle on one. The red is easily the best of the three colors in the new collection, including the Volcanic Red, Cobalt Blue, and Sterling Silver. It’s bright with a nice deep sheen that works well in both hard and soft light. The Volcanic Red DualSense controller, like the maroon Cosmic Red before it, also looks very nice thanks to the classic red-on-black scheme. The blue is nice and equally satin in finish, though it blends in far more with a dark background. Coming up last is the silver, as it reminds me of far too much bare steel, and I’d rather not be reminded of the Cybertruck every time I move to turn on my console. It’s also rather easy to switch each cover. They’re labeled individually with one of the classic PlayStation “shape” buttons, so you should know where each needs to go. Removing each panel takes a fair bit of elbow grease, but if you don’t fear breaking the plastic, they will come off eventually. We’ve yet to see third-party companies like DBrand release their own alternative colors, but the individually swappable plates might make for some interesting designs going forward. 2 / 11 3 / 11 4 / 11 5 / 11 6 / 11 7 / 11 8 / 11 9 / 11 10 / 11 11 / 11"

    "article_content": "This post was updated on 6/18/24 at 9:52 a.m. to include new information from the latest Nintendo Direct. It was updated 5/8/24 at 11:55 a.m. ET to include comments from Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa. Nintendo Switch sequel speculation has hit a fever pitch despite how long we may have to wait for the long-expected update to Nintendo’s most popular console ever created. Now, we finally have confirmation that Switch 2 is real . As for specifics and specs, that’s still left up to the rumors. While there’s been a bevy of initial rumors suggesting we will eventually see a Switch sequel release this year, several reports now offer a much longer wait until 2025. Nintendo has since been clear about when we can expect news. The latest Nintendo Direct taking place June 18 seemed like a good opportunity for a teaser with its 40-minute runtime, but Nintendo explicitly said this was only for new Switch games coming out in the latter half of 2024. The company wrote on Twitter that there would be “no announcement regarding the successor to the Switch.” As for what the console will eventually look like, most reports indicate it will have a bigger screen than the first Switch and cost more. They will have graphics capabilities equivalent to those of the previous console generation. The Switch sequel is rumored to have a bigger screen than the original console had at launch, but new rumors suggest the next console could change up the size of the Joycons and even how they attach to the main body. As first reported by the Spanish tech news site Vandal (via Eurogamer ), the Switch 2 will use magnets to attach its Joycons, rather than the rails Switch users are used to. Vandal reported this based on word from accessory manufacturers, who often get console hardware details before release. The next console will still support current Switch Pro controllers, which is a nice change of pace for owners who still want to get a few more years out of their current controllers once the new console comes in. The Spanish site didn’t say exactly how big the new Switch will be but noted it will be larger than the current Switch and still smaller than a Steam Deck . Anybody holding out hope that Switch will still manage to squeeze itself into 2025's release schedule should probably accept the reality of a longer wait. Most recently, Nikkei Asia reported, based on several anonymous sources with knowledge of Nintendo’s plans, that the Japanese game maker will release the Switch sequel in around March 2025. The company is reportedly trying to give publishers and game studios more time to release actual games for launch day. Instead, Nintendo will try to keep pushing the first Switch as much as possible, possibly with new console tie-in versions with popular franchises. It confirms earlier reports that Nintendo has decided to push the Switch 2 release. Brazilian journalist Pedro Henrique Lutti Lippe claimed on his podcast that five sources from within the industry say that Nintendo is now aiming for a Q1 2025 launch after initial expectations slipped from 2024. If that wasn’t enough to set your teeth on edge, Eurogamer also confirmed similar rumors from separate sources within the industry. Eurogamer mentioned that the Switch date is to ensure a full slate of launch titles to complement the new console. It all seems to indicate Nintendo has told its partner developers about the new launch date, and these rumors have filtered down to those with scarce industry sources. It seems Nintendo will remain aloof from the entire hardware market for 2024. Nintendo confirmed to Eurogamer on April 15 that it does not plan to attend Gamescom, the annual conference held in Cologne, Germany, which is normally a center point for the world’s games and hardware developers. The company told Eurogamer, “After careful consideration from all perspectives, we’ve made the decision not to be present at Gamescom 2024. Players will have opportunities to try out Nintendo Switch games at other events throughout the year.” That’s an interesting move, considering Nintendo normally attends the conference. Gamescom 2023 was also where some of the first concrete rumors reared their head, where some publishers reportedly received development kits . If Nintendo does opt for the first half of the 2024 Switch 2 announcement, it would be rather premature considering the expected launch date. Nintendo previously said that the Switch 2 wouldn’t debut in 2023 . However, the company had nothing to say about the upcoming console in its latest quarterly financial report released this past Wednesday. Instead, the company noted how hardware sales have decreased by about 8% yearly. This was despite Switch becoming the best-selling console of all time in its seven-year lifespan, with a total of 139.36 million units sold as of the end of last year. Most rumors have suggested the Switch sequel will see the light of day in the second half of this year . Those rumors go back to July of 2023, reinforced after news that some developers had a chance to demo the new console in several closed-door meetings at Gamescom. This won’t necessarily have a Christmas release, as speculation has consistently noted that it could be available for pre-order in August or September. That could coincide with the rumored PlayStation 5 Pro model , which would be a big step up from the original PS5’s internals with ray tracing upgrades and better CPU and GPU specs. All the current speculation points to the Switch 2 getting access to its special chip from Nvidia. It’s a rumor going back nearly three years to early leakers hinting that Nintendo would get access to a custom variant of the T234 , scaled down drastically to fit inside a mobile design. The current Switch uses a modified Tegra X1 chip, but the next Switch could be far more capable than Nintendo’s first handheld console. Documents shown publicly from the Microsoft buyout of Activision Blizzard hint that Nintendo’s console could be as powerful, if not a bit more capable, than the last console generation—namely the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Reuters then dumped a lot of fuel onto those rumors by citing one anonymous source who claimed that Nintendo was indeed getting a new, custom chip. Late last year, Digital Foundry performed a deep dive into the supposed chip architecture and capabilities of this custom Nvidia chipset dubbed the T239. They performed benchmarks with similar architecture on the RTX 2050 running at 750 Mhz. Still, it’s better not to look at chip rumors and make assumptions about the next console’s full capabilities. Instead, we need to understand better what kind of display it will have. Some of the most concrete reports from industry analysts noted that the Nintendo Switch sequel will have an 8-inch LCD . Compare this to the regular 6.2-inch Switch LCD screen, a significant size bump. However, a few fans are likely disappointed that the next console won’t maintain the Switch OLED’s beautiful , 7-inch organic display . The LCD screen is likely a way to keep costs down, which served the first Switch well when buyers had to consider spending upwards of $500 on a new Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5. Still, other handheld consoles like the Steam Deck OLED will have an edge on whatever comes out of Nintendo. The following console could still interact much like the old one with the hybrid cartridge and online download system that served the first Switch so well, at least according to outlets like VGC and Eurogamer. It hints at backward compatibility, which would be a big incentive for current Switch owners. However, that doesn’t mean the Switch 2 will be as cheap as its predecessor. Noted tipster Zippo has claimed it could cost around $400, which is $100 more than you can get the first Switch for. It’s still less than the two most significant, expensive consoles, but it would now cost more than an Xbox Series S . Instead, it would cost as much as a baseline LCD Steam Deck. In early April, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa tweeted that the sequel switch could be announced anytime in the next fiscal year. But here’s the rub: Nintendo’s fiscal year ends in March of next year, meaning we could still have a long wait until 2025 to see any real hint of the new console. Furukawa’s message was directly after the company announced its latest quarterly earnings. Noted industry analyst David Gibson wrote that the company’s president also told investors that the “Switch next model is the appropriate way to describe” the Switch 2. We still don’t know what it will be called (though I would love to see something like “Super Nintendo Switch”), but at the very least, it points to how Nintendo sees its next console as a continuation of the current-gen model. Nintendo would likely announce this console alongside some new Nintendo Direct broadcast or game launch. The latest Nintendo Direct on Feb. 21 was one of its “partner showcases” that promotes 3rd party titles making their way to the Switch. While there were a few surprises, including the original two games of the Star Wars: Battlefront series making their way to the Switch and bringing back the classic 64-player online multiplayer, there was not even a morsel of news regarding a new console. Drake doubled down on that Direct date in a tweet . This makes sense, especially as Nintendo’s first Direct of 2023 also took place in February, but that doesn’t mean we’ll see a console announcement as early as this month. The Nintendo tipster hasn’t fully backed off his claim that Nintendo plans to announce the console in March, but at this point, it seems increasingly unlikely. The Mario parent could also announce its console during a media push for its next big game release. The only first-party title on the docket is Princess Peach: Showtime! , which is set to launch on March 22. Though that’s a new title from a staple character in the company’s most lucrative franchise, it doesn’t have the entire global appeal of a new Mario platformer like last year’s Super Mario Bros. Wonder that would add any pomp to a recent console reveal or–hell–even a teaser. Want more of Gizmodo’s consumer electronics picks?

    "article_content": "Donald Sutherland has departed at the age of 88, but the acting powerhouse will forever live on thanks to his iconic array of performances. While a lot of his best-known works are not in the sci-fi, fantasy, and horror realms (think MASH , National Lampoon’s Animal House , JFK , Pride & Prejudice , and many more)—he did venture into geekier territory on many occasions . Here are 10 standouts specifically among his genre movies. While Nicolas Roeg’s thriller, set mostly in Venice, became infamous for Sutherland’s realistic sex scene with co-star Julie Christie, horror fans will also thank it for giving them a lifelong fear of red raincoats, specifically very small-sized ones. Streaming free with ads on Pluto TV . Philip Kaufman’s 1978 update of the Red Scare classic stars Sutherland as a San Francisco man who falls for the woman he’s on the run with while desperately trying to avoid either of them becoming pod people. His “point-and-scream” reaction is one of the most chilling final moments in cinematic history. Streaming on Prime Video . Before the cult TV show came the cult movie, starring Kristy Swanson as the Valley Girl who’s also a once-in-a-generation monster killer, and Donald Sutherland as the very patient man sent to prepare the Chosen One for her destiny—no matter how much she totally does not want the responsibility. Rent or buy on Prime Video . This Robert Heinlein adaptation didn’t set audiences on fire back in 1994, but considering the talent behind it (it was co-written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, who penned Shrek and multiple Pirates of the Caribbean movies, and Dark Knight trilogy co-author David S. Goyer) and in front of the camera (along with Sutherland, it stars Keith David, Will Patton, and Yaphet Kotto, among others), perhaps it’s time to re-appraise. The plot is, as the title suggests, about alien parasites who arrive on Earth hellbent on mind-control. Rent or buy on Prime Video . Sorry for getting “Time Is on My Side” stuck in your head for the rest of the day, but that’s unavoidable when talking about this tale of a serial killer who uses his occult know-how to live on after being executed—and continue his crimes by possessing random people. Denzel Washington plays the detective tasked with this bizarre case, with John Goodman as his partner and Sutherland as their skeptical boss. Rent or buy on Prime Video . If you’re looking to be entertained by an extremely goofy sci-fi movie about a salvage team (Sutherland is the captain; Jamie Lee Curtis is part of the crew) who realize too late that the research vessel they’ve stumbled upon may be missing its Russian occupants... but is still very much occupied by aliens aiming to cyborg-itize humanity—well, Virus is here to make your B-movie dreams come true. Rent or buy on Prime Video . The legend of the Bell Witch—framed in a deeply unsettling narrative about child abuse—comes to life in this tale, which mostly takes place as an extended flashback set in the early 1900s, starring Sutherland and Sissy Spacek. The cast is admittedly better than the movie itself in this instance. Stream on Starz . Sutherland played the villainous President Coriolanus Snow across The Hunger Games , The Hunger Games: Catching Fire , The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 , and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 . Sutherland brought gravitas to the complex character, so far the only Hunger Games creation to get his own prequel too. Stream the series on AMC+ . Tommy Lee Jones and Brad Pitt play the fraught father-and-son duo that anchors James Gray’s film , but Sutherland brings plenty of his usual charisma as a colleague of Pitt’s character—and gets to be a part of that FIGHT WITH SPACE PIRATES ON THE MOON . Rent or buy on Prime Video . In one of his final roles, Sutherland stars as the titular phone-owner alongside It ’s Jaeden Martell in John Lee Hancock’s Netflix horror movie. The device in question is an iPhone, but because this is a Stephen King adaptation, well... you know it has a direct line to someplace distinctly supernatural. Stream on Netflix ."

    "article_content": "For nearly a decade, a persistent myth has influenced public perception and news coverage of the opioid overdose crisis: the idea that you can get sick or even die from simply touching or being near fentanyl. But there is no strong evidence for this claim, and plenty to argue against it. Scroll through fentanyl-related headlines, particularly those involving law enforcement, and you’ll see a pattern emerge soon enough : first responders, police officers, or bystanders experiencing a variety of symptoms soon after being exposed to some amount of fentanyl. These sorts of stories, along with the specific claim from some law enforcement officials that “fentanyl can kill you just by touching it,” seem to have first spread widely around 2016 . The idea picked up further legitimacy that year after the Drug Enforcement Agency released a video, as well as an accompanying press release, warning about the dangers of fentanyl exposure via the skin (both may have been temporarily taken down , but updated versions are still up today). Media outlets do now seem less likely to uncritically parrot the idea that casual exposure to fentanyl can be deadly than they did five years ago , when Gizmodo first covered this issue. Individual public health agencies and other groups have also begun to more openly counter the belief. But the myth remains alive and strong among some law enforcement agencies and even lawmakers , with at least three states—Florida, West Virginia, Tennessee—currently weighing bills that would allow prosecutors to press felony charges against people accused of exposing first responders to fentanyl and similar opioids. It’s understandable why people might be afraid of getting close to fentanyl. It and other synthetic opioids like carfentanil are indeed more potent than naturally derived opioids like heroin or morphine. So the risk of a fatal overdose from typical consumption is more likely. Over the past decade, the greater availability and use (often unintentional) of illicit fentanyl has driven a large surge in deaths, with 2023 being the third straight year of over 100,000 documented fatal overdoses in the United States. But based on what we know about these drugs, there just doesn’t appear to be a grave danger from simply touching or being around fentanyl. Even in its powdered form, the drug isn’t absorbed quickly through the skin, according to expert toxicologists. Medical fentanyl can be delivered via dermal patch, but these doses are slowly absorbed over hours to days. In 2017, the American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) and American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT) released a joint position statement to counter the burgeoning spread of fentanyl-related misinformation. Based on their assessment of the available evidence, the groups concluded that the “risk of clinically significant exposure to emergency responders is extremely low.” There are some potential scenarios in which fentanyl could be dangerous to passersby. If someone touched fentanyl powder, then tried to wash it off with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, for instance, the alcohol actually could increase the skin’s ability to absorb the drug. Accidental introduction of fentanyl into the mucous membranes of the eyes and mouth, such as by touching it and then touching one’s eyes, could potentially cause enough exposure to result in illness. And it’s theoretically possible for enough fentanyl powder to become aerosolized and pose a danger just by breathing in the same area. However, this would require unusual circumstances, such as being in a very windy room with a significant amount of fentanyl present. The ACMT, AACT, and other groups have created pragmatic guidelines for first responders who come across fentanyl to further minimize their risk. These include wearing a pair of disposable non-latex gloves for low risk situations and donning a mask for higher risk environments, along with advising people to only use soap and water to wash off any fentanyl that ends on skin. None of this is to say that law enforcement officers and others exposed to fentanyl aren’t experiencing symptoms as a result. But many symptoms commonly reported during these accounts, such as a racing heartbeat , dizziness , or feeling sweaty , don’t match those of a typical opioid overdose, which include slowed breathing, blue skin, and shrunken pupils. So at least some of the time, these cases are more likely to be a manifestation of (understandable) anxiety or fear than fentanyl-related . Despite growing skepticism from media and health agencies, the myth that casual fentanyl exposure is deadly persists among some law enforcement and lawmakers, with several states considering related felony charges. But it’s a solution in search of a problem that doesn’t really exist. And this myth only distracts from the actual dangers of fentanyl, while taking time and energy from the efforts needed to curtail America’s very real overdose crisis."

    "article_content": "A bracelet and possible sword pommel found in a 3,000-year-old treasure hoard were forged from meteoritic iron, according to a team of researchers that recently studied the pieces. In other words, yes: some Bronze Age Iberian was rocking space jewelry and wielding a space weapon. The iron was discovered 50 years ago, when the archaeologist José María Soler found the treasure hoard buried under a boulevard in Villena, Spain. The trove consisted of 66 pieces of gold and silver bowls, bracelets, bottles and ornaments, as well as a couple of pieces made of iron. The hoard is now known as the Treasure of Villena . But here’s the rub: the treasure was hidden 3,000 years ago, before widespread knowledge of iron metallurgy. The team’s research, published in Trabajos de Prehistoria , posits that the iron pieces may have been made in the Late Bronze Age—before humans began working with terrestrial iron. The bracelet is made entirely of iron, while the hemispheric object interpreted as a sword pommel is iron covered in a gold four-pointed star design, according to El País . To determine the origins of the iron in the hoard, the team sampled the pieces and tested the iron’s nickel composition, which tends to be higher in iron from space than terrestrial iron. The team also looked for elements that turn up in meteoritic iron, like cobalt, using mass spectrometry. The team found there was a high probability the hoard’s iron was meteoritic in origin. Before the rise of iron metallurgy, humans used iron from fallen meteorites to make precious items. The most famous example of this is the pharaoh Tutankhamun’s meteoritic dagger , a small blade found in the tomb of the “boy king.” An analysis by a different team published in February 2022 suggested that Tutankhamun’s blade was made through low-temperature forging, but not in Egypt. One of the 3,400-year-old Amarna Letters mentions an iron dagger given to Tut’s grandfather, the pharaoh Amenhotep III, by the king of Mitanni, a region of Anatolia. It’s possible the famous blade was a family heirloom. But pharaonic Egypt kept fastidious records, at least compared to the group that forged the Treasure of Villena. According to El País, study co-author Ignacio Montero Ruiz, a researcher at the CSIC Institute of History, said that the makers of the treasure and where they got the iron is still unclear. Given the 2022 explanation for Tut’s iron, it’s possible that the materials used to make the Villena hoard weren’t from Spain. More analysis may clarify the remarkable trove’s origins, and perhaps even the wearer of the ancient luxury goods. More : The Best Archaeological Discoveries of 2023"

As proof of concept, Warner Bros. has released a promotional image of Shaggy and Scooby-Doo dangling from the back of a miniature Kei truck — painted like the Mystery Machine— as both a sumo wrestler with butterfly wings and a multi-eyed beast draped in sashimi tail them in hot pursuit. Based on both the poster and description given, Go-Go Mystery Machine will be one of the rare Scooby series’ to reduce the roles of Fred, Daphne and Velma for a controversial brand new supporting cast of mystery solvers— this time, a trio comprised of “gadget wiz” Toshiro, “magical friend” Etsuko and Scooby’s very own Japanese uncle , the exquisitely-named Daisuke-Doo. If that wasn’t enough, the synopsis additionally leads us to believe it will be one of the odd outliers of the franchise to have the monsters be legitimate supernatural beings instead of costumed criminals—a perennially divisive choice some have argued is anathema to the franchise’s original ghost-breaking ethos. While you and I know those people are provably wrong (the title character is a talking dog , after all), Go-Go Mystery Machine may still have a hard row to hoe amongst a skeptical public in light of the franchise’s recent decisions— including the poorly-received Velma , its first theatrical animated film underperforming at the box office, and Warner Bros’. unpopular decision to cancel its nearly-completed sequel for tax purposes. It’s also unclear if the powers-at-be have decided to move forward with its teased Gremlins crossover film, Scooby-Doo! Gremlins Getaway , or have scuttled the project entirely. In light of everything, though, it’s difficult to imagine a fan of the original series’ 60’s psychedelia-meets-gothic German expressionist visual style wouldn’t be intrigued by the promise of a Grudge or Ring -inspired chase sequence featuring music by Babymetal , Shonen Knife or Melt-Banana —especially if the backgrounds are painted in watercolor.

    "article_content": "The incognito or private mode found in most web browsers is back in the news, with Google updating its disclaimer to give users a better idea of exactly how this feature works. Whether you use Chrome or one of the alternatives, the feature works in the same way—and it doesn’t cover your tracks quite as well as you might have thought. If you’re going to use incognito mode, you’ll want to know exactly what is and isn’t logged while browsing to avoid any nasty surprises. Here, we’ve laid out all the details, which should give you a better idea of Incognito or private mode is best used for visiting places on the web that you don’t want to show up in your browsing history. You can probably think of a few website categories that might apply without us listing them here—but if you need to research a sensitive medical issue, that could be one reason for loading up an incognito tab, for example. Close a tab in this private mode, and you can’t quickly bring it back again like you would be able to normally: Your browser has already forgotten you ever opened it. Sites you visit while browsing incognito won’t later appear as automatic suggestions when you start typing out a new URL in your browser’s address bar either. Incognito mode also blocks cookies, those little bits of data stored on your computer or phone that tell websites about you and your preferences. As cookies aren’t stored, you’ll find yourself signed out of all your usual websites and web apps, and you’ll probably see a flurry of special offers and newsletter sign-ups appear (because these sites will think you’re visiting for the very first time). What’s more, data typed into web forms, like usernames, passwords, and addresses, doesn’t get logged into incognito mode in the same way that it often is normally. However, if login details and other bits of information are already stored in your browser, you can still access this data while you’re browsing privately. In some ways, incognito mode is something of a throwback to an earlier time when it wasn’t the norm to have separate sign-ins for browsers and accounts that synced everything across multiple devices. It’s most effective if you’re hiding your browsing from someone who shares the same devices as you, but these days, your browsing history is pretty well protected from other people’s snooping anyway. Essentially, incognito mode is like your browser turning its back on your web activities for a while—it’ll forget the browsing session ever happened. The issue with incognito mode is that we’re now all tracked in a multitude of other ways as well, and that’s where the limitations of this form of private browsing start to show. Incognito or private mode is very much focused on the information stored on the device you’re using it with—it doesn’t do much to stop all of the other tracking that goes on while you’re on the web. Put it this way: If you sign into your Amazon account, Amazon is still going to know about it, whether you’re in incognito mode or not. If you then run searches for products on Amazon, Amazon will remember those searches—though Chrome, Edge, or whatever browser you’re using won’t. If you add items to your basket, Amazon will remember them. As soon as you sign in somewhere, many of the protections that incognito mode offers will disappear. Your internet service provider will still know what you’ve been looking at, and if you’re in a place of education or work, your browsing may be monitored by staff at the institution or company you’re at, too. Files you download don’t disappear, nor will any bookmarks you’ve saved while browsing in incognito mode. Installing a VPN (Virtual Private Network) app gives you more protection against tracking in its various forms—it’ll hide your activities from your internet provider, for a start—but the same rules apply when signing into Amazon (or Facebook, or Google): As soon as you identify yourself, those sites will start keeping tabs on you. Incognito mode does not mean you’re anonymous online; nobody else can see what you’re doing, or sites and apps can’t see where you are in the world, which is where some confusion comes in. It doesn’t really do anything extra to protect data going to and from your device either, though browsers now do a decent enough job with this whether you’re in private mode or not. Going incognito does still have its uses, especially on shared devices, but you need to be aware of its limitations. If you want to browse the web and leave no trace, for example, or stop big tech from tracking you, then further actions are required—like regularly deleting your browsing history and browser cookies .

    "article_content": "This week at the Gizmodo science desk, deputy editor George Dvorsky reported on a modification to the famous Drake Equation that produces a rather sobering result about the number of extraterrestrial intelligences in our Galaxy. Health reporter Ed Cara chronicles a mysterious disease from the 1500s that vanished from history, while space reporter Passant Rabie notes the return of the sunspot cluster responsible for those incredible auroras. - George Dvorsky 2 / 12 Astronomer Frank Drake formulated his influential equation in 1961 to estimate the number of civilizations in the Milky Way capable of communicating with us. Our understanding of planetary science has changed a lot since then, leading a team of scientists to propose a pair of important adjustments that produce an answer that could explain the Great Silence. - George Dvorsky Read More 3 / 12 Death and illness have never been strangers to humanity. But for a brief time around the 1500s, there was one particular ailment that was both brutal in its devastation and completely undecipherable to medical practitioners of the time. This malady was known as sweating sickness, and even today, scientists don’t know where it came from, why it seemed to suddenly leave, and whether it could ever return again. - Ed Cara Read More 4 / 12 It’s back! After unleashing the strongest geomagnetic storm in more than 20 years, the notorious sunspot cluster AR3664 is once again visible and still spewing copious amounts of radiation into space. - Passant Rabie Read More 5 / 12 China’s curious spaceplane is at it again, releasing an unidentified object into orbit that could signal the end of its mysterious mission. The U.S. Space Force is currently tracking the mystery object, which the reusable spaceplane appears to have released on May 24 at around 3 p.m. ET, Jonathan McDowell, astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, noted on X. “This object could be a subsatellite deployment, or it could be a piece of hardware ejected prior to end of mission and deorbit (the spaceplane’s first flight did something similar)“ he wrote. “Will be interesting to see if the plane maneuvers or lands soon.” - Passant Rabie Read More 6 / 12 Canada’s wild hogs are apparently poised to invade America’s yard. In new research this month, scientists have found evidence that these invasive wild pigs have a “high potential” to cross over the Canadian border and establish new populations in mostly pig-free parts of the U.S., particularly South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, and Minnesota. - Ed Cara Read More 7 / 12 Tech companies try to keep their interview questions secret, so that prospective employees can’t prepare answers in advance. Applicants reclaim the power by sharing their interview experiences publicly on websites like Glassdoor and CareerCup. As a result, what were intended as forums to help career hopefuls navigate the job market have become like a WikiLeaks for puzzle lovers. This week, I’m declassifying Bezos’s documents and delivering them straight to your browser window, with free shipping, of course. - Jack Murtagh Read More 8 / 12 Two sets of human remains, a variety of paintings, and a handful of childrens’ doodles were recently found in Pompeii, the ancient Roman town that was buried by a volcanic eruption in 79. - Isaac Schultz Read More 9 / 12 An engraved stone slab found under a Coptic building in Abydos, Egypt, is part of the sarcophagus of Ramesses II, according to a team of archaeologists who analyzed the hieroglyphics on its side. - Isaac Schultz Read More 10 / 12 We’re sorry to disappoint Star Trek fans, but the exoplanet often compared to Mr. Spock’s fictional world has turned out to be nothing more than star flickers masquerading as a super-Earth. - Passant Rabie Read More 11 / 12 NASA and Boeing set a new date for the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft despite an unresolved issue with a gas leak that was discovered earlier this month. - Passant Rabie Read More 12 / 12"

    "article_content": "Artificial intelligence chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT are being sold as revolutionary tools that can help workers become more efficient at their jobs, perhaps replacing those people entirely in the future. But a stunning new study has found ChatGPT answers computer programming questions incorrectly 52% of the time. The research from Purdue University, first spotted by news outlet Futurism , was presented earlier this month at the Computer-Human Interaction Conference in Hawaii and looked at 517 programming questions on Stack Overflow that were then fed to ChatGPT. “Our analysis shows that 52% of ChatGPT answers contain incorrect information and 77% are verbose,” the new study explained. “Nonetheless, our user study participants still preferred ChatGPT answers 35% of the time due to their comprehensiveness and well-articulated language style.” Disturbingly, programmers in the study didn’t always catch the mistakes being produced by the AI chatbot. “However, they also overlooked the misinformation in the ChatGPT answers 39% of the time,” according to the study. “This implies the need to counter misinformation in ChatGPT answers to programming questions and raise awareness of the risks associated with seemingly correct answers.” Obviously, this is just one study, which is available to read online , but it points to issues that anyone who’s been using these tools can relate to. Large tech companies are pouring billions of dollars into AI right now in an effort to deliver the most reliable chatbots. Meta, Microsoft, and Google are all in a race to dominate an emerging space that has the potential to radically reshape our relationship with the internet. But there are a number of hurdles standing in the way. Chief among those problems is that AI is frequently unreliable, especially if a given user asks a truly unique question. Google’s new AI-powered Search is constantly spouting garbage that’s often scraped from unreliable sources. In fact, there have been multiple times this week when Google Search has presented satirical articles from The Onion as dependable information . For its part, Google defends itself by insisting wrong answers are anomalies. “The examples we’ve seen are generally very uncommon queries, and aren’t representative of most people’s experiences,” a Google spokesperson told Gizmodo over email earlier this week . “The vast majority of AI Overviews provide high-quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web.” But that defense, that “uncommon queries” are showing wrong answers, is frankly laughable. Are users only supposed to ask these chatbots the most mundane questions? How is that acceptable, when the promise is that these tools are supposed to be revolutionary? OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday about the new study on ChatGPT answers. Gizmodo will update this post if we hear back."

    "article_content": "The third episode of The Acolyte is pretty incredible for a lot of reasons . It’s an episode that, in content, invites us to consider new perspectives on some of the saga’s most fundamental spiritual ideas , and delivers a meaty slice of back story for its protagonists and antagonists alike. But it also does something quite remarkable for Star Wars : it asks us to not make the assumption that what we are watching is the whole truth. “Destiny” puts a pause on the present story of The Acolyte and its Jedi murder-mystery to flash back 16 years to explore Osha and Mae Aniseya’s upbringing on the planet Brendok as part of a coven of witches, and the tragic circumstances that tore their family apart—leaving Mae to her seeming death, and Osha recruited by a group of Jedi. But the episode is never framed explicitly as recollection by either sister: the episode starts and we are already 16 years in the past on Brendok, the episode ends and the credits roll. We never come back to the present to be told how what we’re being shown in flashback is being delivered to us. The episode leaves plenty of clues for the audience just who’s perspective we’re getting—it’s Osha whose interiority and perspective we most closely follow throughout the episode—but it asks the audience itself to intuit that, instead of flat-out saying so. And in doing that, it also asks the audience to go a step further: that it also has to realize that what it is watching is one perspective, steeped in bias, that that perspective does not have the entire picture of events. There are things about “Destiny” that are not clear from one moment the next, things that don’t match up with what we’re being told about events that occur—like how we’re told the accident that leads to the coven being wiped out save for Osha is a “simple” fire, but what we see through the young Osha’s perspective is something far more devastating and involved than that fire could have ever been, resulting in piles of strewn witch bodies. We come out of the episode with a better understanding of Osha’s backstory, and her sister’s, and the reasons why they both are on the paths they are on 16 years later. But at the same time we still come out of it with a lot of questions—not just for the things we don’t see in this set of flashbacks, but with questions about the perspective behind what we do see. The Acolyte wants us to recognize that it is more than not just giving the full picture here, but that we are getting one specific perspective of that picture, a perspective that is inherently built from recollections shaped by bias and perception. That, at some point in its story further down the line, there is a chance we will see another telling of this event that changes things we thought we knew, or adds context to them, or adds new things in turn—and that that telling in and of itself is also just one perspective shaped by its own set of perceived biases. Just as Star Wars has long worn its inspirations from Akira Kurosawa’s The Hidden Fortress on its sleeve, it’s Star Wars through the vector of another Kurosawa film in turn: Rashomon , the 1950 classic about the murder of a Samurai, recounted to the audience through multiple contradictory and subjective retellings of the event. Rashomon ’s international success and appraisal saw the film go on to give name to the Rashomon Effect, the storytelling method of acknowledging the unreliability of narrators and eyewitnesses by offering different interpretations of the same events. And it is a narrative device that is extremely rare for Star Wars . It’s not entirely new of course—there’s direct parallels you can draw between “Destiny” and The Last Jedi , for example, for how we see alternate recollections of the night Luke Skywalker’s Jedi Academy was destroyed, the moment he almost struck his own nephew down out of fear of the Dark Side within him. There’s also the nature of Star Wars ’ broad story being one that we’ve learned out of order, and how further context has shaped and changed things we thought we knew. We went from the original trilogy, to the prequels, and then to the sequels years later—and now all the way around and in between those sets of movies, we have shows, comics, and books that have provided explanations or ways to bridge characters and events across that whole period of the Skywalker saga. The very act of building a definitive canon, especially in the era of Lucasfilm’s ownership under Disney and the decision to completely re-overhaul Star Wars continuity back to the source point of what would become nine original films, is inherently about this, as we constantly learn new information that contradicts or re-contextualizes what came before. But that’s also what makes doing something like this—offering us a telling of an event for the first time in one hand, and implicitly asking us in the process to immediately not believe it as an entirely true telling—so rare and fraught in the first place. For better or worse, the modern era of Star Wars , and a lot of its fandom along the way, has been taught that canon is king . That every new show, book, movie, comic, video game, whatever, that is coming out, is part of this singular, defined canon. Inadvertently or otherwise, its audience has been taught to take the narratives it is offered and break them down into a set of rules about the way Star Wars ’ world works, into the raw facts about characters and events, and that those things are unequivocally true: because they have to be, to fit into this new canonical definition of what Star Wars is as an entire universe. The facts are almost as fundamental to its existence as a franchise as whatever narrative embellishments are made weaving those facts into the universe in the first place. Even if, as we’ve said, Star Wars has always been built on half-truths and myths since its very beginning—it is a franchise that can treat the phrase “ from a certain point of view ” as akin to being as much as a catchphrase as “may the Force be with you” is—the audience has been taught to expect that whatever narrative is being laid out to them in new material is by and large to be trusted as true within the context of Star Wars ’ fundamental canon. It’s what makes these moments where a particular story decides to challenge that idea not only so rare and exciting, but also deeply controversial to a lot of people—it’s not something we are often asked of by Star Wars , even if it is a common storytelling device. It’s unfair to seemingly hoodwink an audience that is not used to being hoodwinked, for good or ill, after all. You can’t teach that audience to treat everything as facts to be learned and categorized and then suddenly start telling them that not all of those facts are necessarily correct—there has to be a certain amount of faith on both parties before you can experiment like that. But a galaxy far, far away that asks us to take such ideas into account—that there are many perspectives and ideas to consider about the stories we’re told, that there is potential in being open to being mistrusting sometimes, not due to some narrative failure but so we can broaden our interpretation—is one that is far stronger, and more interesting, than one that isn’t, simply through the sheer potential it opens Star Wars to from a storytelling standpoint. If Star Wars can be anything, then sometimes it can also be untrue... from a certain point of view. Want more io9 news?

    "article_content": "The Pentagon was behind hundreds of Twitter accounts spreading anti-vaccine propaganda as a way to undermine China during the height of the covid-19 pandemic, according to an explosive report from Reuters Friday. U.S. government officials confirmed to Reuters the existence of the campaign, which started under former president Donald Trump in mid-2020 and continued under President Joe Biden until the spring of 2021. The U.S. propaganda campaign, which included “at least 300\" Twitter accounts along with accounts on Facebook and Instagram, first targeted social media users in the Philippines. But the effort eventually spread out to focus on people more broadly in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East using accounts that were active for at least five years. The U.S. government posts on Twitter, now known as X, questioned the quality of face masks and covid-19 test kits, according to Reuters, and also spread disinformation about China’s Sinovac vaccine, the first that would become available to people in the Philippines. As Reuters notes, the Philippines had one of the worst covid-19 vaccination rates in Southeast Asia and one of the highest death rates in the region. The propaganda campaign was reportedly run out of the U.S. military’s psychological operations center at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, and utilized a hashtag, #ChinaAngVirus, which means “China is the virus” in Tagalog. X deleted many of the accounts associated with the campaign after Reuters asked about it. From Reuters: Tailoring the propaganda campaign to local audiences across Central Asia and the Middle East, the Pentagon used a combination of fake social media accounts on multiple platforms to spread fear of China’s vaccines among Muslims at a time when the virus was killing tens of thousands of people each day. A key part of the strategy: amplify the disputed contention that, because vaccines sometimes contain pork gelatin, China’s shots could be considered forbidden under Islamic law. While the campaign was started under Trump’s administration, Reuters discovered the effort continued well into President Biden’s time in the White House, despite being warned about what was happening by executives at Facebook. Meta even held a Zoom call with members of the National Security Council, who would eventually kill the program, even though the discussion initially “became tense.” Somewhat surprisingly, Reuters was able to get an anonymous senior Defense Department official to admit the existence of the propaganda campaign. The government typically denies involvement when psychological operations are exposed. The article also quotes an unnamed Pentagon spokesperson who tried to rationalize the deceit by pointing out China had launched its own disinformation campaign “to falsely blame the United States” for the spread of covid-19. The Reuters story doesn’t mention many U.S. officials by name, outside of presidents Biden and Trump, but the article does explain that Jonathan Braga, a military commander overseeing Southeast Asia, was instrumental in pushing disinformation online to counter China’s influence. The program received the approval of Mark Esper, Trump’s Secretary of Defense. At least half a dozen unnamed employees at the State Department objected, according to Reuters. Oddly, one of the things that may have helped kill the anti-vaccine campaign may have been how incompetently it was run. From Reuters: The Pentagon’s audit concluded that the military’s primary contractor handling the campaign, General Dynamics IT, had employed sloppy tradecraft, taking inadequate steps to hide the origin of the fake accounts, said a person with direct knowledge of the review. The review also found that military leaders didn’t maintain enough control over its psyop contractors, the person said. General Dynamics IT recently won a $493 million contract for more psychological operations, if you can believe it. Social media has made it much easier for nation-state actors to spread disinformation, but the U.S. government was distributing propaganda in foreign countries long before Twitter and Facebook were invented. The U.S. government spent years running articles under fake bylines in newspapers around the world in the 1950s and ‘60s. The U.S. Information Agency (USIA), America’s foreign propaganda arm during the Cold War, would write articles under names like Guy Sims Finch to advance U.S. business interests. Gizmodo filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the CIA about the campaign in 2016 but was denied on the grounds that we couldn’t provide names of the real people who wrote under that name, a condition to supposedly ensure the privacy rights of those government agents were respected. The CIA infamously used a fake hepatitis vaccination campaign in Pakistan after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, that was actually a cover to conduct DNA testing in a secret campaign to find Osama bin Laden. That campaign caused a backlash against all vaccinations in the region, harming public health in immeasurable ways for generations to come. More recently, the U.S. has been exposed to running social media campaigns in Cuba to sow anger at the Communist government, even launching its own version of Twitter . Those efforts were first launched in 2010 and 2013 under President Barack Obama."

    "article_content": "The first public beta of Android 15 for the platform’s most faithful users rolled out this month. While the operating system version will arrive much later this year—typically right before October’s Pixel launch event —it can be fun to try on new features as they’re being built out. It can also be a disaster, so I implore you not to try the beta on your daily device but a secondary one. Life is already challenging enough; the last thing you need is a smartphone that bricks in the middle of an important phone call because of some unexplained bug that occurred at random. The Android 15 beta is a small but humble improvement over its predecessor so far. The current features you can try are mostly minimal in scope. However, you can use your Pixel device as a webcam tethered to your computer. This first beta will also let you preview features like the new edge-to-edge UI with updated Material design principles. There should be more features to paw at in the subsequent few beta updates. Expect a more significant update to launch around Google I/O 2024. We’ll hear more about what’s in store for Android 15 at Google I/O 2024. Until then, if you have an extra Pixel device floating around, grab it, and let’s get the beta version. Before you keep reading, please back up your device somewhere in the cloud. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Thankfully, Google has made it easier to install an Android beta. No programming or launching of a third-party app is required. You don’t even have to connect your smartphone to a computer. This straightforward process should give you the confidence to try the beta on your secondary device. You will need to enroll that second device in the Android Beta program . This action will trigger Google’s servers to send the install package to your specific device if eligible. You can opt-in and out of betas from this page. If you install the beta and decide to revert, it’s all possible from this page. Currently, the beta is supported on the latest crop of Pixel devices, including the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6a series. After signing up for the beta on your device, you can wait for the system notification to start the update processor or head to Settings > System > System update to manually check for it."

    "article_content": "Details surrounding the death of John Barnett, a corporate whistleblower who was in the midst of suing aviation giant Boeing when he was found dead in a parking lot earlier this year, have finally been revealed. Barnett was a former quality control engineer at Boeing who accused the company of serious safety infractions. His body was discovered on March 9th after he failed to show up to court for his latest deposition. Barnett was found in his truck, which was in the parking lot of the Charleston, South Carolina, motel where he had been staying during court proceedings. On Friday, the coroner’s office in Charleston released its final assessment of his death. It was previously reported that Barnett died of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, which led to the natural presumption that he had died by suicide. However, the odd circumstances of Barnett’s death—amidst a litigation effort against the powerful aviation company—instantly launched conspiracy theories that blamed Boeing for his death. The coroner’s new report does nothing to dispel the notion that Barnett took his own life. Its verdict is that his “cause of death was determined to be: Gunshot Wound of the Head” and that the “manner of death is best deemed” as suicide. The report provides details about how Barnett’s body was found and the investigation that took place to assess how he died. One section of the report details the surveillance footage that was taken of Barnett’s vehicle in the hours before his death. This video, which was retrieved from security cameras stationed both inside the hotel and the hotel parking lot, shows that nobody was seen near Barnett’s car except for him, the report says: A thorough review of the footage revealed Mr. Barnett entered the hotel lobby on March 8, 2024, at 1926 hours. He exited the hotel at 2037 hours. At 2045 hours, his truck was observed backing into the parking space where it was later discovered. Video surveillance recordings continuously record his vehicle. Throughout the review of surveillance video spanning the evening of March 8th through the morning of March 9th, from the time the vehicle was backed into the parking space until the Charleston Fire Department gained entry to the vehicle, no other individuals were seen entering or exiting Mr. Barnett’s vehicle. At no time did anyone engage or try to make contact with Mr. Barnett. The vehicle brake lights were captured blinking on and off at 0720 hours on March 9, 2024. The report also mentions that “a notebook containing writing resembling a suicide note” was discovered inside the truck with Barnett. On the topic of this note, the coroner continues: The writings found in the vehicle were examined by the Charleston Police Department and found only Mr. Barnett’s fingerprints on the notebook. The writings contained information known only to his family. The coroner’s report blames Barnett’s death on mental health and stress issues spurred by the ongoing lawsuit, as well as other issues: “A review of medical records and interviews with Mr. Barnett’s family, attorneys, and healthcare professionals, revealed Mr. Barnett was under chronic stress in the context of the lawsuit, suffered from anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, and grieved the death of his wife.” Barnett’s family had claimed that his death was the result of mental health issues. The family accused Boeing of having contributed to the stress that eventually led him to take his own life. “He was suffering from PTSD and anxiety attacks as a result of being subjected to the hostile work environment at Boeing which we believe led to his death,” the family’s statement reads.

    "article_content": "Dinosaurs’ reign on Earth ended explosively (and then dustily, as we’ll mention in this story) when an asteroid slammed into Earth some 66 million years ago. But the dinosaurs—and the diverse ancient creatures they shared the planet with—have kept many secrets locked away in their fossilized remains, secrets which paleontologists work tirelessly to extricate. Here are a handful of the coolest discoveries made about dinosaurs and other ancient life in 2023. 2 / 13 In December, a team of paleontologists announced a stunning find: a teenaged gorgosaurus, a type of tyrannosaurid, with the hindlimbs of two year-old dinosaurs in its stomach. The finding clarified how tyrannosaur diets change as the animals grow. You can read more about the discovery here . 3 / 13 In October, paleontologists announced the discovery of Jormungandr walhallaensis , a 24-foot-long lizard that inhabited the Western Interior Seaway about 80 million years ago. Mosasaurs were massive reptiles that ruled the world’s oceans in the Cretaceous period, and J. walhallaensis— among the northernmost mosasaurs found in the ancient seaway—was no exception. The fossil is named for the son of Loki in Norse mythology as a nod to its findspot, near Walhalla, North Dakota. 4 / 13 Perhaps no mass extinction has gotten greater attention (to the chagrin of modern conservationists) than the Cretaceous-Paleogene event, which saw about three-quarters of life on Earth die out after an asteroid slammed into the ocean just off the Yucatán peninsula. This year, a group of researchers posited that dust kicked up by the impact was the main driver of the mass extinction; by their calculations, the dust could have stayed in Earth’s atmosphere for 15 years, blotting out the Sun and thus cooling the planning by about 27 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius). You can read more about the team’s findings here . 5 / 13 In July, a team of paleontologists published a paper in Scientific Reports describing a thrilling, 125-million-year-old fossil : a possum-sized mammal biting down on a beaked dinosaur. The fossil is so incredible because it shows mammals and dinosaurs interacting; though the groups of animals shared the Earth, fossilized examples of it are rare. 6 / 13 This year, paleontologists showed off a neat find: an absolutely stuffed species of trilobite, which had fossilized from its carapace to the crushed-up critters in its digestive tract. Thanks to the circumstances of its preservation—the Ordovician critter was buried in a mud flow at the bottom of the sea—the research team was able to see the ostracods and bivalves the animal had eaten, as well as marks on its carapace that suggest scavengers had burrowed into the animal after its death. Sure, they’re not as popular dinosaurs, but such an immaculately preserved trilobite deserves a spot on this list. Read all about it here . 7 / 13 Feast your eyes on this agate, which researchers concluded this year formed inside the egg of a large dinosaur. The agate was found in India and registered in the collections of London’s Natural History Museum 140 years ago, though the egg in which the agate formed is about 60 million years old. The researchers believe the egg probably belonged to a titanosaur, the largest land animals to ever live and which were common in Cretaceous India. 8 / 13 In August, a team of researchers announced the discovery of a peculiar reptile with scimitar-like claws. The 230-million-year-old fossil of a lagerpetid, a group that likely gave way to flying pterosaurs, included cranial remains, which gave the researchers an opportunity to better understand the true diversity of the Triassic animals. Read all about the lagerpetid— Venetoraptor gassenae — here . 9 / 13 Remember the titanosaur egg from two slides ago? Well, this year paleontologists in India announced the discovery of 92 titanosaur nests across India, showing the geographic spread of the ancient giants. Read more about this prolific find here . 10 / 13 Research this year suggested that meat-eating theropod dinosaurs like T. rex and Velociraptor actually had skin that covered their large, deadly teeth. Spare a thought for the paleoartists who now need rework their illustrations of these suddenly less-terrifying beasts. Read all about the findings here . 11 / 13 Okay, this one is technically from December 2022, but close enough. Paleontologists found a small, four-winged dinosaur— Microraptor zhaoinus —with a mammal’s food in its stomach. More dino-mammal interactions please, paleontology! We can’t get enough of them. Read more . 12 / 13 In case you missed it: In November, the American Ornithological Society announced that the common English names of a swath of North American birds ( the only living dinosaurs ) would be scrapped. The goal is to remove human-names from birds, since many avian namesakes weren’t the nicest people. Read more about this ongoing drama . 13 / 13"

    "article_content": "X Premium users have been able to hide the posts they’ve liked for months now, but the feature may soon become the default for everyone. A director of engineering at X said the platform is making likes private in a Tuesday post, noting that public likes may be discouraging people from engaging with content that might be considered “edgy.” “Yeah, we are making likes private,” Wang said in a tweet . “Public likes are incentivizing the wrong behavior. For example, many people feel discouraged from liking content that might be ‘edgy’ in fear of retaliation from trolls, or to protect their public image.” Wang noted that soon, “you’ll be able to like without worrying who might see it.” Notably, Elon Musk liked this tweet, as revealed by his public likes. Currently, most users on X have their likes publicly displayed on their profiles, which shows all users the posts they’re engaging with. X started offering paying users an option to hide their likes last September, but Wang’s tweet suggests the feature may be expanding broadly. Twitter’s public likes feature has historically revealed the “edgy” content celebrities and public figures are enjoying at any given moment. It’s the feature everyone forgets about but always comes back to bite them. Senator Ted Cruz’s Twitter account once liked a pornographic video , but then he blamed a staffer and said “It’s not going to happen again.” Samuel L. Jackson was once caught liking hardcore pornography but then unliked all of them once his fans warned him they were public. And of course, Musk’s own public likes have placed him in hot water before. In 2022, Musk liked an anti-trans tweet from the notorious right-wing account, Libs of TikTok. Currently, Elon Musk’s liked tweets reveal that in the last week, the owner of X has liked a meme saying Dr. Anthony Fauci is really Dr. Evil , a meme making fun of trans activists , and a whole lot of tweets about himself. This change falls in line with Musk’s broader vision for X to conceal likes and reposts more broadly. Previously, Musk revealed a long-term plan to hide likes and repost counts on the timeline , creating a cleaner experience that only shows the view count. He went on to explain that you’ll only be able to see likes and reposts when you click on the actual post. This change hasn’t happened yet, but Musk says it is “ definitely happening. ” Making X’s likes private would surely let folks engage more freely with content on the platform. Your likes on X contribute to the algorithm’s accuracy in recommending you more content, so it could improve the user experience. However, it also takes away a key accountability feature that made Twitter so entertaining."

    "article_content": "Say what you will about X, but it’s still the best place to watch powerful people slam each other on social media. Elon Musk walked into an unsuspecting Twitter beef this holiday weekend with none other than Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun, who used the platform against the billionaire that owns it. “[Musk] claims to want a ‘maximally rigorous pursuit of the truth’ but spews crazy-ass conspiracy theories on his own social platform,” LeCun said in a tweet Monday, responding to a job posting for a position with xAI. He mockingly listed other claims from Elon Musk, including that AI will kill everyone and the billionaire’s belief that xAI’s work will be solved next year. “I like his cars, his rockets, his solar panels, and his satellite network,” LeCun said in a followup tweet . “I very much dislike his vengeful politics, his conspiracy theories, and his hype.” LeCun clarified to another account that he is a scientist and not a business or product person. Musk chimed in to say LeCun was “just following orders,” to which LeCun said, “You don’t seem to understand how research works.” Musk responded by asking what ‘science’ LeCun had done recently, to which Meta’s Chief AI Scientist posted a link to his Google Scholar page with “over 80 technical papers published since January 2022.” The owner of X followed up by saying that was “nothing” and that LeCun was “going soft.” The entire exchange, which LeCun later remarked as “ holiday fun ,” seemed slightly more hostile than either suggested. This followed a barrage of attacks from Musk against Meta’s products and services. WhatsApp is the latest victim of Musk’s tweet storm. He posted on Friday that the encrypted messaging app “ exports your user data every night. ” The head of WhatsApp responded directly to Musk saying, “ This is not correct ” and that the company takes security seriously. Hugging Face CEO Clem Delangue said he would pick LeCun over Musk “ every single day of the week. ” Delangue noted that LeCun has made significant contributions to the AI community without cashing out like some others have. Notably, Musk’s X just announced a $6 billion funding round from a slew of Silicon Valley venture capital firms and investors. The exchange also exposed a riff between Musk and LeCun’s views on artificial intelligence. Whereas Musk often preaches to AI doomers, those who believe the technology could be existential to humanity, LeCun offers a much less fear-inducing view on AI risk. LeCun calls these “doomers” delusional, and said in a tweet recently that “it’s too early to worry about [AI]. And it’s way too early to regulate it to prevent “existential risks.”"

    "article_content": "Elon Musk has been talking with Donald Trump “several times a month,” about a wide range of topics, according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal . And while Musk has denied rumors that he might donate money to the former president, the new reporting indicates Musk is working behind the scenes to make sure his businesses benefit if Trump is elected again in November. Musk’s friendly rapport with Trump is notable given the fact that the billionaire tech titan said as recently as 2022 that Trump should “ sail into the sunset .” But a lot has changed over the past two years, including Musk’s increasingly bizarre obsession with illegal immigration , the issue that first made Trump a serious contender in the Republican Party back in 2015. From the Journal: The pair have held discussions on immigration, technology and science, including the U.S. Space Force. Their views and interests have grown more aligned, the people said, with Musk calling Trump directly on his cellphone. Recent talks between the two men have also involved Musk’s companies, including SpaceX, Tesla, and X, according to the Journal. And that makes sense when you remember how dependent Musk’s companies have been on government funding. SpaceX has massive contracts with military and intelligence agencies, and Tesla has benefited greatly from EV tax credits. The new reporting notes Musk and Trump have discussed EV credits and the electric vehicle industry more broadly, citing people close to Trump, which is curious if only because the former president has recently said he wants to stop all EV sales in the U.S. Musk has also asked Trump to return to X, a platform Trump was banned from in the days after the attempted coup of January 6, 2021. That was an era before Musk owned the social media platform, of course, but it makes sense that Trump would be cautious about rejoining a platform he doesn’t control. Trump lost his megaphone after the insurrection, and the former president seems determined not to lose his voice if things get violent again. Trump is also making money hand-over-fist with Truth Social , the platform he founded to ensure nobody can silence him. Trump Media and Technology Group, which owns Truth Social, lost about $300 million last quarter, according to the Associated Press . Musk didn’t respond to questions emailed on Wednesday but the Trump campaign released a statement that asserted the former president’s authority while trying to attach him to Musk. “President Trump will be the only voice of what role an individual plays in his presidency,” Brian Hughes, senior Advisor to the Trump campaign, told Gizmodo in an email. “But it has been widely reported and is demonstrated in a number of ways, that many of the nation’s most important leaders in technology and innovation are concerned with the damage done to their industry by Biden’s failures to handle our economy and his moves to overburden innovators with government bureaucracy and unrelenting regulation,” Hughes continued. Musk has previously said he used to be a Democrat, claiming he voted for a Republican for the first time in 2022 . But whatever Musk’s political history he seems to be all-in on Trumpism. And while Musk may not be personally donating money to Trump’s campaign, he’s working to get the man elected by lobbying powerful people to help Trump retake the White House. Musk even teamed up with billionaire investor Nelson Peltz to work on some kind of “data-driven” project to fight against supposed election fraud. The issue is near and dear to Trump’s heart since the former president falsely claims he actually won the 2020 election. However, details surrounding the voting project seem to be sparse. From the Journal: Musk and Peltz have told acquaintances they are working on a massive data-driven project to ensure votes are fairly counted, echoing Trump’s accusations of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Trump’s own attorney general, Bill Barr, has rejected those claims about the 2020 election. Trump’s campaign and its allies lost dozens of lawsuits challenging the results. Musk and Peltz described the initiative to Trump in the March meeting, according to a person familiar with that discussion. More details about the antifraud effort couldn’t be learned. All we know for certain is that Musk is fully on board the Trump train. And if Trump wins in November—which is a very distinct possibility the way the national polls look —Musk could have an important role to play in steering the country. 7:38 p.m. ET: Updated with comment from the Trump campaign."

    "article_content": "Elon Musk’s social media platform X officially made like private on Wednesday, after The Verge reported it was rolling out the feature on Tuesday. Hidden likes, which were previously available to Premium users, is now the default for everyone on X. X users received a pop-up notification on Wednesday afternoon saying “Your Likes are now private.” The pop-up said the feature will “better protect your privacy” and that “liking more posts will make your ‘For You’ feed better.” “Important to allow people to like posts without getting attacked for doing so,” Musk said in a tweet on Tuesday, responding to a tweet about The Verge’s report. Musk seems to be reiterating what X’s director of engineering Haofei Wang said last month: X is making likes private to encourage folks to like “edgy” content without fear of being ridiculed. X senior software engineer Enrique Barragan, who tweeted that something is launching today, previously said this update will still allow you to see like counts and who likes your own posts. However, he says you won’t see the people who liked someone else’s post or their “Liked” tabs. For years, Twitter’s public likes page has been a sort of accountability system for the social media platform. However, Musk and his new regime feel that X would be better off without it. Likes inform X’s algorithm, which can suggest better content to users who could potentially spend more time on the platform. A change like this might make X users engage with more content, but the question is, what content is this change vindicating them to interact with? As of Tuesday afternoon, likes appeared to still be visible by default on X. Musk’s Likes tab reveals that he’s spent the day engaging with several memes regarding Apple and OpenAI’s partnership, specifically regarding their alleged privacy issues (a narrative he’s peddling pretty hard himself). Musk has stated before a broader vision to simplify the X platform , concealing likes and posts more widely on the timeline. It’s unclear when this change will happen, but this is the general direction for X these days. Many of us remember when Texas Senator Ted Cruz’s Twitter account once liked a pornographic video, but then he blamed a staffer and unliked it. Samuel L. Jackson was also caught liking Twitter porn once, but then he unliked them when fans called him out. The Liked tab has been a glorious accountability system for a long time, but we may have just bid it farewell forever."

    "article_content": "Following the success of the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag and SmartTag+, the company announced a third successor in the line on Wednesday : Galaxy SmartTag2. Launching on October 10, the SmartTag2 promises upgrades in several areas which include the SmartThings Find companion app, battery life, design, and security. In terms of the redesigned SmartThings Find companion app, users now get a new Compass View feature which allows them to look at how far and in what direction the SmartTag2 is in relation to them. Any UWB-supported Galaxy smartphone is able to support this feature. The app also offers a new full-screen map view and a retouched interface that’s supposed to be more intuitive. To allow quick and easy access, users now also get a shortcut to the app on their phones. The battery life on the SmartTag2 has gotten an impressive boost. I t has seen a 50% increase as compared to previous models and has been extended to 500 days. T here’s also a new Power Saving Mode which makes your SmartTag2 last for a whopping 700 days when enabled. That’s more than twice as long as its predecessors and around twice as long as its rival, Apple’s Airtag. There are two notable design upgrades as well. The SmartTag2 features a completely revamped ring-shaped design that’s much more compact than before. Its compactness is really appreciated since it’s a significant shift from the obtrusive and clunky design of the SmartTag+. Though we did see a ring on the SmartTag2’s predecessor as well, this one comes with metal on the inside of the loop to better support rugged accessories. The new tag furthers its support for rugged use by sporting an IP67 water and dust resistance rating which can be especially helpful for pet owners. As far as security is concerned, SmartThings Find encrypts users’ data and then adds an extra layer of security to it using Samsung Knox. It also makes sure that your SmartTag can only be tracked by one device at a time. Additionally, through the ‘Unknown tag alerts’ feature, SmartThings Find sends users a notification as soon as it detects an unknown SmartTag moving with them. This helps prevent unauthorized tracking."

    "article_content": "Samsung’s One UI 6 update brings a number of features to the Galaxy camera that promise to improve your photos. These six new features are marketed to both serious photographers as well as the average smartphone user. The Enhance X-App aims to minimize the steps required to take a picture and also attempts to make sure all your pictures turn out great. It offers a couple of interesting features: Taking a page out of iOS’ features , AI Image Clipping lets you clip an object from a picture, save it as a sticker, and add it to other pictures or videos. The new update offers multiple AI-integrated scanning features. Document scan will come up automatically when a document is detected. It will also recognize fingers or bulldog clips and remove them from your images so that it only shows the document you intended to scan. With the High Resolution Quick Setting, when you take pictures in Photo or Pro Mode, you get a Resolution button in the Quick Settings menu at the top of your screen that allows you to instantly switch to high-resolution shooting and take 200MP pictures. Custom Camera Widgets aim to speed up the time it takes for you to open your camera app and choose the right settings for the object you wish to photograph. It tries to make sure you don’t miss the perfect moment by offering to save your go-to shooting modes as camera widgets that you can just quickly tap on. This one’s very similar to the last feature. It brings up a new Tools menu on your camera with all the features you use the most. You can also fix the vertical and horizontal alignment of your picture on one screen with the integration of the Straighten and Perspective functions in the Transform edit menu."

    "article_content": "The S Pen Creator Edition was announced in July when the Galaxy Tab S9 was released. Well, now you can finally buy it for $99 in the US . As the name suggests, the S Pen Creator Edition is best suited for artists and is designed with sketching and digital painting in mind. It promises better artistic capabilities than its predecessor, the S Pen. The two main features that make it stand out from the S Pen are its tilt-sensitivity and thick shape for enhanced grip. You can use the S Pen Creator Edition with Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and higher, Galaxy Note10 and higher, Galaxy Tab S Series, and PCs that work with the existing S Pen. However, it isn’t compatible with the Galaxy Z Series. The stylus is battery-free and doesn’t require charging, saving you some hassle. Like an Apple Pencil does, the flat side of the Pen can magnetically attach to your Galaxy Tab devices. The S Pen has only been released in white and hosts a single button on its side. This button can be used to interact with the tools on the applications on your devices, such as allowing you to switch between the eraser and the pen tool. According to Samsung, this is their most advanced S Pen yet. However, there are some limitations to this pen. For instance, Air Commands, a feature that allows you to quickly access various functions by pressing the stylus button and hovering over the display, is, for some reason, not supported on the S Pen, which is strange. Another feature that stands out as a bit strange is the IPX4 rating on this pen, which is less than the IP68 rating on the cheaper S Pen that this one succeeded. Anyway, an IPX4 rating means it’s good enough to withstand light splashes, so that shouldn’t be a complete dealbreaker."

    "article_content": "Samsung Electronics executive chairman Lee Jae-yong will not have to put his prison uniform back on—for now, at least. The Seoul Central District Court on Monday found Lee not guilty of committing stock manipulation and accounting fraud during a 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates : Samsung C&T, a construction company, and Cheil, an amusement park and clothing company. Lee is the son of former Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee. He’s been leading the Samsung group since his father suffered a heart attack in 2014. Kun-hee passed away in 2020. According to the Associated Press , prosecutors argued that Lee and other Samsung executives manipulated assets so that the merger would be favorable to Cheil — where Lee happened to be the biggest shareholder — and harmed shareholders of Samsung C&T. Prosecutors were seeking a prison term of five years for the Samsung chief and also pointed out that the merger gave Lee more control over Samsung Electronics as a whole. Lee has maintained his innocence and stated the merger helped make the multinational company more stable. The court appeared to agree with Lee’s argument. Seoul Central District Court Chief Judge Park Jung-jae said there was not enough evidence that Lee aimed to cause losses at Samsung C&T, CNN reported . “Even if Lee’s control has been strengthened, the merger in this case cannot be considered unfair, as long as there is a reasonable purpose for the merger,” Park said. It was unclear on Monday whether prosecutors would appeal the court’s ruling. Lee’s acquittal is the newest chapter in the drama related to the controversial 2015 merger. In 2017, he was found guilty of bribing former South Korean president Park Geun-hye and her confidant with roughly $6.4 million to secure the government’s support for the merger. The scandal led to months of protests and outrage from South Koreans and the impeachment of Park. In that case, Lee was sentenced to five years in prison but was released after less than a year and forced to face a retrial. The 2021 retrial of the bribery case found him guilty, sentenced him to two and a half years in prison, and released him on parole later that year. In 2022, President Yoon Suk Yeol pardoned him for the bribery charges. Lee’s legal wrongdoings don’t appear to have affected him in the long run. He was appointed executive chairman of Samsung Electronics about a year after he was released from prison on a bribery conviction. With a net worth of $8 billion, he was also the second richest person in South Korea in 2023, according to Forbes . Lee has claimed that he is very sorry for all the trouble he’s caused Samsung and its shareholders and wants to focus on increasing the company’s glory. “In the future, I would like to ask for the opportunity to help Samsung become a truly top-notch company and to focus all my capabilities on moving forward,” Lee said in his trial last year."

    "article_content": "Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Office are breaking up, opting for a separate life that will make both its competitors and European regulators happy. Microsoft confirmed to Gizmodo on Monday that it will sell Teams separately from its Office suite of products on a global level. The company has been offering Teams as a free add-on to customers who buy Office 365 and Microsoft 365 for years. Teams experienced huge growth during the covid-19 pandemic, growing from 20 million users in November 2019 to 44 million in March 2020 and 75 million one month later, according to Business of Apps . As of last year, Teams had more than 300 million users. The news of the unbundling of Teams from Office 365 and Microsoft 365 was first reported by Reuters . Trouble started brewing in 2020, when Slack, one of Teams’ main competitors, filed an antitrust complaint regarding the Teams and Office bundle with European Union regulators, arguing that Microsoft was using its dominant position with Office to force its customers to use Teams and hiding its true cost. Last year, European regulators announced they had opened a formal investigation into Microsoft’s bundling of Teams with Office 365 and Microsoft 365. “The Commission is concerned that Microsoft may be abusing and defending its market position in productivity software by restricting competition in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’) for communication and collaboration products,” the European Commission said in a July 2023 press release . “In particular, the Commission is concerned that Microsoft may grant Teams a distribution advantage by not giving customers the choice on whether or not to include access to that product when they subscribe to their productivity suites and may have limited the interoperability between its productivity suites and competing offerings.” One month after the announcement of the investigation, Microsoft said that it would no longer offer the Teams and Office bundle in the European Economic Area, which includes Norway, Lichtenstein, Iceland, Switzerland, and the 27 states of the European Union. The company continued, however, to offer the bundle to customers in other countries worldwide—until today. In a statement to Gizmodo, Microsoft confirmed it had made the decision to unbundle Teams from its Office suite of products based on feedback from the European Commission. “To ensure clarity for our customers, we are extending the steps we took last year to unbundle Teams from M365 and O365 in the European Economic Area and Switzerland to customers globally,” a Microsoft spokesperson said. “Doing so also addresses feedback from the European Commission by providing multinational companies more flexibility when they want to standardize their purchasing across geographies.” Beginning on April 1, customers will be able to choose whether to keep their current Teams + Microsoft 365 or Office 65 bundle, update, or switch to Microsoft’s new offerings that separate the products. For new customers, a standalone monthly subscription to Teams will reportedly cost $5.25 per month, while Office without Teams will cost between $7.75 and $54.75 depending on the product. You can check out the full price breakdown here . Update 4/1/2024, 5:27 p.m. ET: This post has been updated with additional comment and information from Microsoft."

    "article_content": "The Department of Homeland Security issued a damning review of Microsoft’s cybersecurity practices on Tuesday, blaming the cloud provider for exposing the emails of high-ranking government officials. The review found Chinese-state affiliated hackers capitalized on “a cascade of security failures at Microsoft,” and says the company’s security culture “requires an overhaul.” “It is imperative that cloud service providers prioritize security and build it in by design,” said the Cyber Safety Review Board Chair Robert Silvers in a press release . The report cites issues with Microsoft’s corporate culture around security that led to this attack. The email accounts of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, the U.S. Ambassador to China R. Nicholas Burns, and Congressman Don Bacon were compromised. The threat actor downloaded over 60,000 emails from the State Department alone, according to the report. The board says this intrusion was “preventable and should never have occurred,” and that Microsoft’s security culture requires major changes. The damning report paints a picture of an internal mess behind the scenes at Microsoft. The DHS says Microsoft issued inaccurate public statements about the root cause of this attack, which according to the report, Microsoft has still not been able to identify. Microsoft did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment. A hacker group affiliated with the People’s Republic of China, Storm-0558, was responsible for the attack. As early as May 2023, hackers compromised the mailboxes of government officials by stealing signing keys and utilizing a flaw in Microsoft’s token validation system. This allowed Storm-0558 full access to essentially any Exchange Online account, Microsoft’s hosted messaging platform. On June 15, the State Department detected a data breach and notified Microsoft. At this point, the Federal Bureau of Investigations became involved, and Microsoft alerted an organization in the United Kingdom that they had been hit by the attack as well. By June 24, Microsoft was able to invalidate the stolen key Storm-0558 was using. Many of the government officials hit in this attack have substantial responsibilities in maintaining the United States’ relationship with China, so it doesn’t seem to be a coincidence they were hit. The DHS board issued sweeping recommendations that Microsoft revamp its security practices, including calling out CEO Satya Nadella and the board of directors to directly focus on the company’s security culture. The government review says these security risks should be appropriately addressed before new features are deployed."

    "article_content": "We’ve known for some time that Microsoft is dropping support for Windows 10 on Oct. 14, 2025. But on Tuesday, Microsoft announced just how much it will cost commercial organizations to keep getting security updates for its old operating system, first reported by The Verge . Microsoft will charge $61, per device, for the first year of security updates, according to a blog post published Tuesday . Every year after that, the price will double. Year two will cost $122, year three will be $244, and year four will be $488, and so on. It could end up costing you a fortune to keep securely using Windows 10. Microsoft updated the blog on Wednesday to note that this only applies to organizations. Consumers will have a different pricing plan that will be released at a later time. These Extended Security Updates are typically only offered to organizations using old Windows operating systems, but they’ll soon be offered to consumers for the first time. Microsoft is expanding this subscription program due to the large number of people still running Windows 10. According to Statcounter , nearly 70% of Windows users are still running on Windows 10. Part of the reason for this is that millions of older computers can’t run Windows 11. Microsoft lists all the system requirements needed to support its newest operating system. For example, your system must have at least 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage to upgrade to Windows 11. That’s increased from Windows 10’s requirements of 1GB of RAM and 16GB of storage . The likely result of this is that millions of people will be forced to buy new laptops and computers. After a few years, that will become the cheaper option compared to paying hundreds of dollars, or even thousands of dollars, for continued security updates. This also raises a question about what Microsoft will do when Windows 12 comes out. There have been rumors that Windows’ next operating system could be here as soon as June 2024 , and it’s almost definitely going to be full of AI capabilities. That means even heftier hardware requirements, and Windows 11 users could be left in the dust, just like Windows 10 users are now."

    "article_content": "Microsoft’s full-throttle push into artificial intelligence technology is getting more scrutiny by regulators worried that the conglomerate is invading consumers’ privacy. The Redmond, Washington-based tech giant was busy this week at Microsoft Build, its annual developer conference , where it announced a new line of laptops equipped with AI hardware and support for AI applications . One new feature in particular stole the show — but not in the way Microsoft had likely hoped. The feature, called Recall, uses AI to build a “photographic memory” of a user’s laptop activity that they can then search. In other words, Recall constantly takes screenshots of a user’s activity on the computer , whether they’re searching for new recipes online, watching videos, or using apps. “We can recreate moments from the past essentially,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told the Wall Street Journal . Microsoft’s announcement of the feature was met with instant backlash from privacy advocates and consumers, including Tesla CEO and xAI founder Elon Musk . The tech giant also has to worry about the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), a U.K. data watchdog, which told the BBC it was reaching out to Microsoft for more information on Recall . A spokesperson for the ICO told the BBC that companies must “rigorously assess and mitigate risks to peoples’ rights and freedoms” before launching new products, especially those that are potentially invasive. Microsoft says that Recall snapshots are stored locally on the PCs, encrypted, and can only be accessed by the person whose profile was used to sign into the computer. Users will also be able to filter out specific apps or websites from being scanned, pause snapshot collection, and delete some or all snapshots stored on their device. “We know that privacy is important,” Microsoft said in a blog post Monday. “Copilot+ PCs are also designed so that even the AI running on your device can’t access your private content. In addition, IT admins can use Microsoft Intune to disable Recall from saving any snapshots, and new policies are coming later to enable IT to centrally filter specific apps and websites.” This article originally appeared on Quartz ."

    "article_content": "Google parent Alphabet is reportedly making headway in its bid to acquire the $30 billion marketing software company HubSpot. That deal, which would be Google’s largest-ever acquisition, is part of the company’s strategy to compete with Microsoft in the cloud applications market. “It does appear that Google has aspirations to try to take market share from Microsoft in the productivity suite, and they can use HubSpot to bundle applications together for clients,” Cowen analyst Derrick Wood said in a research note seen by Reuters . Google is the third-largest cloud services provider but holds less than half of the market share of Microsoft. Meanwhile, Amazon controls a third of the market. Reports of Google’s potential acquisition first surfaced in April, sending HubSpot shares up as much as 11% . HubSpot’s financials keep getting better, though analysts are skeptical over weakened demand for its products. The company swung to a profit of $6 million in the first quarter, with sales surging more than 20% from the prior year. Google’s talks with HubSpot are “ongoing” and no deal has been reached, according to Bloomberg . While Google’s still behind in the cloud market, it’s on a much more even playing field with Microsoft in the AI space, where it’s vying with a number of Big Tech contenders for dominance — with convincing odds. Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon have all announced major new AI applications and features over the past year as well as their own custom AI chips. But Google dropped a motherload of updates to its suite of AI tools called Gemini during its I/O developer conference , solidifying its spot as a major AI player. A week later, Microsoft made its own AI announcements , but they’re now facing heat from European regulators . This article originally appeared on Quartz ."

    "article_content": "Google Search is often referred to as the doorstep to the internet—it’s the first stop on most people’s journey to information online. However, Google doesn’t say much about how it organizes the internet, making Search a giant black box that dictates what we know and what we don’t. This week, a 2,500-page leak, first reported by search engine optimization (SEO) veteran Rand Fishkin , gave the world an insight into the 26-year-old mystery of Google Search. “I think the biggest takeaway is that what Google’s public representatives say and what Google search engine does are two different things,” Fishkin said in an emailed statement to Gizmodo. These documents give a more detailed view of how Google Search controls the information we consume. Bringing the right webpage to your computer is no passive task as thousands of editorial decisions are made on your behalf by a secretive group of Googlers. For SEO, an industry that lives and dies by Google’s algorithms, the leaked documents are an earthquake. It’s like the NFL’s referees rewrote the rules of football halfway through the season, and you’re just finding out while playing the Super Bowl. Several SEO experts tell Gizmodo the leak lists 14,000 ranking features which, at the very least, lay a blueprint for how Google organizes everything on the web. Some of these factors include Google’s determination of a website’s authority on a given subject, the size of the website, or the number of clicks a webpage receives. Google has previously denied that it uses some of these ranking features in Search, but the company confirmed these documents are real, albeit, in its telling, imperfect. “We would caution against making inaccurate assumptions about Search based on out-of-context, outdated, or incomplete information,” a Google spokesperson said in an email to Gizmodo. “We’ve shared extensive information about how Search works and the types of factors that our systems weigh, while also working to protect the integrity of our results from manipulation.” With respect to Google’s “caution,” the company won’t confirm what is or isn’t right about these documents. Google says it’s incorrect to assume this is comprehensive information about Search, and tells Gizmodo that giving away too much information could enable bad actors. Ultimately, we don’t know what goes into determining these factors, or how much weight Google Search gives to each one, if any. “We’re just looking at different variables they’re considering,” said Mike King, an SEO expert who was one of the first to analyze the leak, in an interview with Gizmodo. “This is the granularity of which [Google] looks at websites.” This leak was first noticed by Erfan Azimi, an SEO practitioner who found the API documentation publicly on GitHub. It’s unclear if these documents were truly “leaked” or somehow published by Google in a quiet corner of the web, perhaps by accident. Azimi aimed to publicize these documents by bringing them to Fishkin last week, who asked King to help make sense of them. King notes that one ranking feature “homepagePagerankNs” suggests the notoriety of a website’s homepage could prop up everything it publishes . Fishkin writes the leak references a system called NavBoost—first referenced by Google’s VP of Search, Pandu Nayak, in his Department of Justice testimony—which purportedly measures clicks to boost rankings on Google Search . Many in the SEO industry are taking these documents as confirmation of what the industry has long suspected: A website deemed popular by Google may receive a higher Search ranking for a query even though a lesser-known site may have better information. In recent months, several small publishers have seen their Google Search traffic vanish . When The Verge’s Nilay Patel asked Google CEO Sundar Pichai about this last week, Pichai said he was not clear “if that’s a uniform trend. ” One ranking feature King calls out seems to categorize those small sites uniformly. “They have a feature in there called ‘smallPersonalSite,’ and we don’t know how that’s used of course, but that’s an indication that [Google] is looking to understand whether these are smaller sites,” King said. “Being that so many of these small sites are getting crushed right now, it just goes to show that [Google] is not doing something to offset what these big brand signals are.” Notably, Pichai later mentioned in that interview with The Verge that, at other times, Google has thrown more traffic toward small sites. These ranking features could indicate the levers Google can pull. As more and more national media organizations license their content to appear on ChatGPT, Google Search also appears to be skewing towards larger publishers. Broadly, this could have a squashing effect, compressing what most people hear into just mainstream media organizations. The ripple effects of these leaked Google documents were felt widely. Kristen Ruby, CEO of Ruby Media Group who has worked in digital public relations and SEO for more than 15 years, tells Gizmodo she received an ominous text on Monday night: “Shit is going down with Google tomorrow.” Ruby quickly found the leak and noted two ranking features that stuck out to her: “isElectionAuthority” and “isCovidLocalAuthority.” These features seem to be Google’s way of ranking a web page’s credibility for providing proper information about elections and COVID-19, respectively. In 2019, Ruby wrote extensively about how Google’s measure of trustworthy web pages (which Google refers to as E-E-A-T , standing for Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust) is inherently political. She notes that Google’s measure of these factors tends to skew along political lines. “It is problematic to me that Google is providing no context on critical items in the data such as ‘isElectionAuthority’ or ‘isCovidLocalAuthority.’ How is Google defining an authority in these critical domains?” Ruby said in an emailed statement. “I should not have to guess at what the answer is. Google should be forthcoming and tell me what the answer is.” Even though Google is a business, with a right to private information, Ruby argues that Google has an obligation to answer questions on these ranking features that shape the world around us. King and Fishkin also noticed the ‘isCovidLocalAuthority” and “isElectionAuthority” in their writeups of the leak, both pointing out the importance of search engines in elevating quality information. “I think it’s really important they do provide that sort of discernment for information because like it or not, Google is effectively a public service,” said King. “They probably push back on me saying that, but we think of it as the primary source of how you get to information on the web.” How Google ranks information in these examples is a microcosm of the entire Search ecosystem. On any given day, there are millions of questions about what information to amplify and what to silence. While Google, and several tech companies, have long tried to paint themselves as opinion-less algorithms, these ranking features show that’s not quite the case. There are many more examples of ranking features revealed in the 2,500-page leak. Since Google won’t elaborate on these documents, telling Gizmodo that giving away too much information could enable bad actors, SEO experts are left to make sense of this on behalf of everyone who uses Google Search. Several of these 14,000 ranking features identified in the last week are things that Google explicitly claimed it has not used over the years. In a video from 2016, a Google Search representative declared, “We don’t have a website authority score. ” In an interview from 2015, another Googler said, “ Using clicks directly in ranking would be a mistake. ” It’s hard to make sense of these comments now in light of the leaked documents and Google’s response. “This response is a perfect example of why people don’t like or trust Google,” Fishkin said. “It’s a non-statement that doesn’t address the leak, provides no value, and might well have been written by an AI trained on the past decade’s most soulless corporate messaging.” In the era of AI answers, Ruby notes that the way Google ranks web pages is more important than ever. Instead of a series of links to various perspectives, you might just get one straight answer thanks to Google’s new AI Overviews . However, we’ve seen 10-year-old Reddit posts get strange amounts of authority, telling some users to put glue in their pizza . How Google chooses authority is increasingly important, since the top result may be the only one with a voice now. “We are switching gears. We are moving from one system of search to another,” Ruby said. “AI is impacting search results in profound ways.” Ultimately, it’s hard to say what Google is truly doing with these ranking features. What is clear is that Google created these classifiers, and potentially has even more, to rank websites on the internet. These rankings clearly require judgment calls, adding more evidence that Google Search is not an objective experience, but rather a series of editorial choices made by people within Google."

    "article_content": "Google rolled out AI answers called AI Overview for your search queries earlier this month, and the results were hilarious . From adding glue to your pizza to saying parachutes are useless , it was quite a mess that Google says it’s fixing. The reason for the weird responses to some questions is that there wasn’t much out there on the web that answered those queries in a serious manner, Liz Reid, vice president and head of Google Search, said in a blog post on Thursday. Referred to as a “data void” or “information gap,” these glaring holes of high-quality content that Google searches for ended up being filled with satirical content from sources like The Onion or trolling posts on forums that did have an answer to the query. This results in Google suggesting adding rocks to a healthy diet . “From looking at examples from the past couple of weeks, we were able to determine patterns where we didn’t get it right, and we made more than a dozen technical improvements to our systems,” Reid said. Reid says that to fix the problem, there will be better detection for nonsensical queries that will limit satire and humorous content. User-generated content like forum posts will also be limited. Queries regarding health will have beefed up refinements to give better answers while hard news searches will show fewer AI Overviews. So it looks like, much to the chagrin of Google users, AI Overview is here to stay. While the answers will allegedly get “better,” it’s still something people aren’t fans of. Those who want them gone altogether can check out Gizmodo’s quick guide on how to purge AI Overview from Google Search."

    "article_content": "What does it mean to “ poke ” someone on Facebook? Is it flirty, friendly, or even annoying? The answer is all of the above, and somehow, none at all. The ambiguous feature was largely invisible for many years, but now Facebook is reporting a 13x spike in poking in the last month. “THE POKE IS HAVING A MOMENT,” said Facebook in all caps on Threads . “There’s been a 13x spike in poking on Facebook in the past month. So, be honest: who’s poking who?” Facebook made a few small changes that are responsible for the massive increase in pokes, first reported by TechCrunch Tuesday. The company made it easier to find the poking page through search, and Facebook also improved the platform’s suggestions on who to poke. Reportedly, more than 50% of these pokes are coming from users aged 18-29. Many of these young users are likely experiencing pokes for the first time, as they probably weren’t on the platform when pokes first came out. But the question remains: what even is a poke? And what does it mean? The poke has been around since Facebook’s inception in 2004, and it’s always been unclear what the feature even is. It never went away, but I personally haven’t heard of anyone poking in the last five years. A Gizmodo article from 2014 answers a reader’s question about whether Pokes are creepy or funny . The answer? It’s both. It’s everything. It can be interpreted however you want, and that’s part of the beauty of it. It’s also a terrifying part of it. We’ve all received a poke from someone that sent a shiver down our spine. Was it that distant relative you haven’t seen in a while? Maybe it was your former high school physics teacher, or perhaps an ex girlfriend who things did not end well with. Whoever it was, you probably interpreted their poke in the worst way possible. That’s the danger of poking — it really depends on the context of your relationship. The poke feature came directly from the genius brain of Mark Zuckerberg. Even the notification noise that first played when you poked someone was just Zuckerberg himself going “poke.” You can listen to it on SoundCloud. In many ways, the poke was a preview of just how strange Zuckerberg was. “We thought it would be fun to make a feature that has no specific purpose,” said Zuckerberg in a Facebook post over a decade ago. “So mess around with it, because you’re not getting an explanation from us.” The poke encapsulated a lot of the good and bad about social media. Pokes, like Facebook, connected people in strange ways they never thought of before. There was a delightfully random connection to it that was fun and exciting. However, it was also extremely weird and, arguably, completely unnecessary. The poke also was a precursor to the random dopamine reward systems that are now common on social media. You never knew when you were gonna get poked, so in the back of your brain, you were always kind of waiting for it. If the mere mentioning of pokes returning to Facebook slightly stresses you out, I’m right there with you. Poke also became the name of a failed social media messaging app from Facebook that aimed to compete with Snapchat. One of the app’s creators posted on Facebook that they made Poke in just 12 days , and the app didn’t last long. However, the legacy of “poking” lives on. Now, younger users may be experiencing poking for the first time. I’m not sure if we should be happy or sad for them, but nevertheless, Facebook is trying to make poking a thing again."

    "article_content": "Meta has lots of data through Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook, but that’s not enough for them. Court filings unsealed last week allege Meta created an internal effort to spy on Snapchat in a secret initiative called “Project Ghostbusters.” Meta did so through Onavo , a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service the company offered between 2016 and 2019 that, ultimately, wasn’t private at all . “Whenever someone asks a question about Snapchat, the answer is usually that because their traffic is encrypted we have no analytics about them,” said Mark Zuckerberg in an email to three Facebook executives in 2016, unsealed in Meta’s antitrust case on Saturday. “It seems important to figure out a new way to get reliable analytics about them… You should figure out how to do this.” Thus, Project Ghostbusters was born. It’s Meta’s in-house wiretapping tool to spy on data analytics from Snapchat starting in 2016, later used on YouTube and Amazon. This involved creating “kits” that can be installed on iOS and Android devices, to intercept traffic for certain apps, according to the filings. This was described as a “man-in-the-middle” approach to get data on Facebook’s rivals, but users of Onavo were the “men in the middle.” Meta’s Onavo unit has a history of using invasive techniques to collect data on Facebook’s users. Meta acquired Onavo from an Israeli firm over 10 years ago, promising users private networking, as most VPNs do. However, the service was reportedly used to spy on rival social media apps through tens of millions of people who downloaded Onavo. It gave Facebook valuable intel about competitors, and this week’s court filings seem to confirm that. A team of senior executives and roughly 41 lawyers worked on Project Ghostbusters, according to court filings. The group was heavily concerned with whether to continue the program in the face of press scrutiny. Facebook ultimately shut down Onavo in 2019 after Apple booted the VPN from its app store. Prosecutors also allege that Facebook violated the United States Wiretap Act, which prohibits the intentional procurement of another person’s electronic communications. Onavo could also be considered straight spyware, but also seems to fall under the definition of wiretapping, according to prosecutors. The court filings show chats and emails that depict Zuckerberg as being directly involved in these communications. In 2019, an email was sent to Zuckerberg explicitly asking for his decision on whether SSL decryption (Project Ghostbusters) should stop. However, Meta denies its CEO was anywhere near this. “The plaintiffs’ claims are baseless and completely irrelevant to the case,” said a Meta spokesperson in an emailed statement to Gizmodo. Meta also noted that there was “nothing new here,” continuing that this issue was reported on years ago. Access to a competitor’s traffic analytics would have allowed Facebook a significant advantage when it comes to selling to advertisers. Meta has become a dominant force in the advertising industry in the last decade, and competitors like Snapchat don’t hold a candle to Meta’s analytics. Prosecutors allege Project Ghostbusters harmed competition in the ad industry, adding weight to their central argument that Meta is a monopoly in social media."

    "article_content": "Do you remember Facebook Watch ? Me neither. Mark Zuckerberg’s short-lived streaming service never really got off the ground, but court filings unsealed in Meta’s antitrust lawsuit claim “Watch” was kneecapped starting in 2018 to protect Zuckerberg’s advertising relationship with Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. “For nearly a decade, Netflix and Facebook enjoyed a special relationship,” said plaintiffs in filings made public on Saturday. “It is no great mystery how this close partnership developed, and who was its steward: from 2011-2019, Netflix’s then-CEO Hastings sat on Facebook’s board and personally directed the companies’ relationship…” The filings detail Hastings’ uncomfortably close relationship with Meta’s upper management, including Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg . During these years, Netflix was allegedly granted special access to Facebook users’ private message inboxes, among other privileged analytics tools, in exchange for hundred-million-dollar advertising deals. This gave Facebook greater dominance in its all-important ad division, plaintiffs allege, so the company was fine to retreat from Netflix’s streaming territory by shuttering Watch. In 2017, Facebook Watch began signing deals to populate its streaming service with original TV Shows from movie stars such as Bill Murray. A year later, the service attempted to license the popular ‘90s TV show Dawson’s Creek. Facebook Watch had meaningful reach on the home screen of the social media platform, and an impressive budget as well. Facebook and Netflix appeared ready to butt heads in the streaming world , and the Netflix cofounder found himself in the middle as a Facebook board member. “ There’s not a big conflict yet ,” Hastings said onstage at the 2017 Recode conference when asked about Facebook Watch. “We’re not bidding on the same shows,” he said, though Hastings later regretted these words in an email. “Let me know if you think there was a better way to handle,” Hastings wrote in an email to Zuckerberg unsealed in this case. “In hindsight, I wish I added a materiality qualifier like ‘not generally bidding on the same content.’” These unsealed court filings stem from a class action antitrust case against Meta, first spotted on X by Jason Kint. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of consumers and advertisers, alleges Meta is a monopoly in the social media market. Netflix was a large advertiser to Facebook, and plaintiffs allege Zuckerberg shuttered its promising Watch platform for the sake of the greater advertising business. Zuckerberg personally emailed the head of Facebook Watch in May of 2018, Fidji Simo, to tell her their budget was being slashed by $750 million, just two years after Watch’s launch, according to court filings. The sudden pivot meant Facebook was now dismantling the streaming business it had spent the last two years growing. During this time period, Netflix increased its ad spend on Facebook to roughly $150 million a year and allegedly entered into agreements for increased data analytics. By early 2019, the ad spend increased to roughly $200 million a year. Hastings left Facebook’s board later in 2019. Meta said its agreements and relationships with Netflix are commonplace in a statement to Gizmodo. However, the spokesperson did not answer our questions about whether competition with Netflix was a reason for Facebook Watch being shuttered. “We are confident the facts will show this complaint is meritless,” said a Meta spokesperson. It’s entirely possible that Facebook Watch was shuttered for other reasons, though Netflix is certainly an important partner to Meta. Tech companies shutter projects for all kinds of reasons. However, Hastings found himself squarely in the middle of this conflict, as a Facebook board member and CEO of Netflix, and it seems Watch was never really given a chance to shine."

    "article_content": "A military court in Russia sentenced a spokesperson for Meta to six years in prison on Monday, according to a new report from the English-language Moscow Times . Andy Stone was convicted in absentia for the “justification” of terrorism after the Facebook parent company changed its rules about what’s considered violent speech shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The Russian military court first opened a criminal inquiry into Meta on March 11, 2022, according to U.S.-government-run news outlet Radio Free Europe , less than a month after Russia invaded Ukraine in February of that year. The inquiry was a response to Meta’s policy change that allowed more violent rhetoric about Russia’s invasion on Facebook and Instagram, two platforms that were subsequently banned in Russia. Stone announced the loosened speech restrictions on March 10, 2022 , which apparently made him a target for the Russian authorities. “As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as ‘death to the Russian invaders.’ We still won’t allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians,” Stone tweeted. The new policy also allowed for users to call for the death of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, according to a 2022 article from Reuters . Stone would later clarify that while the company was allowing more violent speech on its platforms to account for frustration in Ukraine at a violent invasion, any calls for violence against Russian civilians were still strictly banned. Calls for violence against Russian soldiers were only permitted by people living in a dozen countries and didn’t include anyone living in the U.S., according to Reuters: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine. Stone should be safe from the Russian courts, provided he doesn’t decide to take a vacation in Moscow anytime soon. Facebook founder and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been banned from entering Russia since April 2022. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has resulted in tens of thousands dead on both sides, according to the BBC , and hundreds of thousands more wounded. Russian President Vladimir Putin first announced the war as a “special military operation,” suggesting it would be a very limited incursion into the country. But it’s been over two years and there’s absolutely no end in sight. Control of information on social media has become increasingly important to governments in the 2020s, especially when war breaks out, from Gaza to Ukraine. And while traditionally the U.S. has promoted an “open internet,” that denounces censorship, that attitude changed recently when China-based TikTok exploded in popularity in the U.S., with over 170 million Americans using the app. Meta didn’t immediately respond to questions emailed on Monday. Gizmodo will update this post if we hear back."

    "article_content": "Apple finally previewed what’s coming to iOS 18 at its annual developer conference keynote . The iPhone’s next major software update will roll out later this year, featuring plenty of AI infusion—Apple Intelligence—plus other quality-of-life improvements across the platform. It’s all excellent news for iPhone users, even if Android wielders have heard it before. In some cases, iOS 18 is playing catchup to its Android competition. But iPhone users seem excited about what’s coming—there were many cheers in the keynote audience—and so-called copycat features mean more parity across mobile platforms, which means less of a Sophie’s Choice whenever shopping for a new smartphone. Here are some new features coming to the iPhone with iOS 18 and how they compare to those already on Android devices. Custom icon placement is no longer limited to Android users with time to burn. At WWDC 2024, Apple announced that iOS 18 would finally let you place app icons wherever you want on the Home screen, freeing them from the stringent rail it was on before. You can move apps to either side of the screen with space in the middle to highlight a subject on your wallpaper. iOS 18 users will have access to tinted icons—something the Pixel Launcher has done since Android 13 . The iOS 18 developer beta shows that the color accents pick up based on your wallpaper and system theme. And if you don’t like the color Apple picks for you, you can adjust it to something else. If you’ve read any tech blog in the past few years, you know that Google had RCS first—and won’t stop reminding us about it. It even took out a giant advertising campaign to hone in on the message. Still, even though Apple quietly announced RCS support this week during its developer conference, Google doesn’t get its victory lap. Apple did not devote any fanfare to its acquiescing to the mobile protocol. On the plus side, messages between iPhones and their green bubbles will be able to share features like high-resolution photos and Tapback animations later this year. The Messages app on the iPhone will let you schedule your messages to send later when iOS 18 rolls out later this year. Google Messages has been able to schedule text messages since 2022. It’s how I’ve kept my iPhone-using friends from coming after me for sending them text messages late at night when my brain is most active. iOS 18 will offer a Game Mode . Apple advertises that it will minimize background activity to help sustain a consistent framerate. Android has had an official game mode offering since Android 12. Some Android smartphones have even made it their identity to be gaming phones—looking at you, Asus Rog Phone . Okay, I’ll admit that Google’s transition from the Assistant to Gemini has not been smooth . But I’ve been able to type out a command to the Assistant for years now, enough that I will miss it when the Assistant eventually faces its expiration date . Well, at least Siri users can type commands, or you will once iOS 18 goes live. I saw a demonstration of typing to Siri at WWDC, which reminded me that it’s a feature I will miss if/when Google forces me to Gemini . Sob. iOS 18 will have a handy feature that lets you record audio sessions with the Notes app and then have it generate a transcription of the session, which you can then combine with other documents and checklists. Google introduced Live Transcribe to the Pixel back in 2019. As of 2021, it’s integrated into the Android system settings. iOS 18 will bring more customization to this pull-down part of the iPhone. In addition to home controls and quick settings, third-party app developers can offer pinnable shortcuts. Android has always had the notification shade. In Android 7, the Quick Settings in the notification shade added editable tiles, which were eventually opened up to third-party app developers. There’s excellent news for iPhone users with a Mac on the desk. iOS 18 will let you stream your iPhone live to your Mac and use it with a mouse and keyboard. You can even drop media between the desktop and mobile environments easy-peasy. Android users have been enjoying this kind of mirrored synchronization with their phones since the first third-party offered the ability in the 2010s. But it’s still up to third parties a decade later, as there’s no native implementation between Android and Google’s Chrome OS. Only the latest Samsung flagships have the added benefit of phone mirroring to the PC using Micorosft’s Phone app. Apple users can generate emojis from a text prompt on the iPhone when iOS 18 hits later this year. Genmoji, as it’s called, is meant to showcase the company’s underlying Apple Intelligence capabilities. The ability sounds similar to Android’s Emoji Kitchen , which has been a hit since it launched on the Google Keyboard in 2020. Emoji Kitchen isn’t as AI-forward as Apple’s Genmoji but just as fun. iPad OS 18 is finally getting its very own optimized calculator app. This isn’t related to iOS 18, but it is worth mentioning because Android has had a calculator for tablets long before Apple did. At the very least, Apple sweetened the deal for iPad users with its calculator app by offering Math Notes , which are unlockable with the Apple Pencil."

    "article_content": "Apple has invented some phenomenal products over the years. Between the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Macbook Air, it’s pretty hard to choose the best one. After Apple’s 2024 Worldwide Developer Conference, YouTuber Marques Brownlee sat down with CEO Tim Cook to get his thoughts on the most infamous Apple devices. That list wouldn’t be complete without mentioning the Magic Mouse. After a long pensive stare into the history of Apple, Cook stroked his chin and dropped this gem: The Magic Mouse. Uhhhhhhh. It was also an incredible moment. Ummmmm. People don’t think of that as much as they would the Macbook Air and the iPad and whatever else you’re going to name probably. Uhhhhhhh. But the, getting the ergonomics well, done – and uh – was key. Yeah. Just bringing up the Magic Mouse, Apple’s wireless mouse that looks like a beetle with its legs in the ai r when you charge it, essentially left the Apple CEO speechless. On my first watch, it seemed like Cook was saying that getting the ergonomics “well done” was key. However, after watching it back a few times and taking a long look at my own Magic Mouse, I’m fairly certain he meant getting the ergonomics “ well, done ” was the real accomplishment. That comma is important. The Magic Mouse has always seemed like a device that Apple just got done, not one it worked very hard on doing well. Contrary to Cook’s comment, the ergonomics are not at all well done on Apple’s Magic Mouse. Late last year, an engineer released what he called, “ the world’s first ergonomic Magic Mouse with no weaknesses. ” He was not the first to try , however. Ivan Kuleshov added a new plastic case for the Magic Mouse to make it more comfortable and included a new charging port that allows you to charge while using it. Cook subsequently was asked about the iPhone, to which he promptly responded, “Oh my god. It changed the world!” It’s a simple, straightforward answer that’s unarguably true. Cook was probably expecting to be asked questions about the iPhone, or maybe new flashy products like the Vision Pro. However, we gotta give credit to Brownlee for asking Apple about what is potentially its most embarrassing device that just won’t go away. The Magic Mouse came out in 2009 , the first mouse ever to use Apple’s Multi-Touch technology that it pioneered on the iPhone and iPod. It came standard with an iMac, powered by two AA batteries, and retailed for just $69. In 2015, Apple released the Magic Mouse 2, which was nearly identical except for being rechargeable. This model featured the iconic abomination of the Lightning connector charging port on the underside of the mouse. In 2022, Apple released a new Magic Mouse 2, but the only difference is it’s black and $20 extra . When it’s flipped over, it still makes me uncomfortable."

    "article_content": "Apple says it’s shutting down Apple Pay Later, the tech giant’s “buy now, pay later” loan service, less than a year after launching the product to United States users in October 2023 . Apple announced the move in a statement to 9to5Mac on Monday, saying it would replace the service with loan offerings from eligible credit and debit cards, as well as Affirm. Apple told 9to5Mac that users with an active loan through Apple Pay Later would still be able to manage and pay their loans using the Apple Wallet app. For the last eight months, Apple Pay Later enabled users to pay for purchases between $75 and $1,000 in four payments over six weeks with no interest, fees, or impact on credit score. However, Apple did not provide a reason for its sudden retreat from the company’s first in-house banking service. Here’s Apple’s full statement to 9to5Mac: Starting later this year, users across the globe will be able to access installment loans offered through credit and debit cards, as well as lenders, when checking out with Apple Pay. With the introduction of this new global installment loan offering, we will no longer offer Apple Pay Later in the U.S. Our focus continues to be on providing our users with access to easy, secure and private payment options with Apple Pay, and this solution will enable us to bring flexible payments to more users, in more places across the globe, in collaboration with Apple Pay enabled banks and lenders.﻿ Apple has ventured further into banking in recent years, but Apple Pay Later was the only financial service the iPhone maker truly handled itself. Apple’s savings accounts and credit cards were offered through Goldman Sachs and Mastercard, but Apple Pay Later issued loans through an in-house subsidiary of Apple, Apple Financing LLC. It was essentially a bank created within Apple licensed to offer these “buy now, pay later” services, and signaled how serious Apple was about its banking push. Apple did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment. Now, just eight months later, the service is inexplicably shutting down. Last week, Apple announced that U.S. users will be able to apply directly for loans through Affirm when they check out with Apple Pay. It was confusing at the time since that’s essentially the same thing Apple Pay Later offers, but now it seems that Affirm and other services will replace Pay Later. Apple first announced Apple Pay Later at WWDC 2022 and was part of Apple’s then-promising push into financial services. However, Apple’s banking unit has been a sore spot in the last year. Goldman Sachs’ CEO David Solomon reportedly faced major internal backlash for the partnership with Apple. Now, with the shuttering of Apple Pay Later, it seems another one of Apple’s new banking services is on the rocks."

    "article_content": "Amazon is phasing out its checkout-less grocery stores with “Just Walk Out” technology, first reported by The Information Tuesday. The company’s senior vice president of grocery stores says they’re moving away from Just Walk Out, which relied on cameras and sensors to track what people were leaving the store with. Just over half of Amazon Fresh stores are equipped with Just Walk Out. The technology allows customers to skip checkout altogether by scanning a QR code when they enter the store. Though it seemed completely automated, Just Walk Out relied on more than 1,000 people in India watching and labeling videos to ensure accurate checkouts. The cashiers were simply moved off-site, and they watched you as you shopped. On Wednesday, GeekWire reported that Amazon Web Services is cutting a few hundred jobs in its Physical Stores Technology team, according to internal emails. The layoffs will allegedly impact portions of Amazon’s identity and checkout teams. Instead of Just Walk Out, Amazon is moving towards Dash Carts , a scanner and screen that’s embedded in your shopping cart, allowing you to checkout as you shop. These offer a more reliable solution than Just Walk Out. Amazon Fresh stores will also feature self check out counters from now on, for people who aren’t Amazon members. “We’re rolling out Amazon Dash Cart, our smart-shopping carts,” said an Amazon spokesperson to Gizmodo. Amazon confirmed this feature is replacing its Just Walk Out technology in existing stores. Just Walk Out was first introduced in 2016 , presenting Amazon’s biggest and boldest innovation in grocery shopping. The technology seemed incredible, but there were some stumbles. It often took hours for customers to receive receipts after leaving the store, largely because offshore cashiers were rewatching videos and assigning items to different customers. The system of scanners and video cameras in each store is also incredibly expensive. According to The Information, 700 out of 1,000 Just Walk Out sales required human reviewers as of 2022 . This widely missed Amazon’s internal goals of reaching less than 50 reviews per 1,000 sales. Amazon called this characterization inaccurate, and disputes how many purchases require reviews. “The primary role of our Machine Learning data associates is to annotate video images, which is necessary for continuously improving the underlying machine learning model powering,” said an Amazon spokesperson to Gizmodo. However, the spokesperson acknowledged these associates validate “a small minority” of shopping visits when AI can’t determine a purchase. Amazon Fresh, the e-commerce giant’s grocery store first launched in 2007, has just over 40 locations around the United States. The company also owns Whole Foods, and many of Amazon Fresh’s experiments are seen as precursors for the large chain. The company is reportedly keeping Just Walk Out technology in a small number of Fresh stores in the United Kingdom, and some of its Amazon Go convenience stores. Amazon has also implemented Just Walk Out technology at several ballparks around the country. These locations will keep the technology going. Amazon is trying to further break into the grocery space to grow into another billion-dollar market. Though it owns Whole Foods, the e-commerce giant still doesn’t compete with food goliaths like Walmart, Costco, and Kroger. Amazon’s push away from expensive tests like Just Walk Out may be a sign the company is looking to further expand its presence as a supermarket."

    "article_content": "Amazon pulled Just Walk Out technology from its grocery stores earlier this week. Amazon says 130 convenience stores, and some Amazon Go locations, will keep using the technology, but a source close to the team told Gizmodo that Amazon has killed off much of the internal development. “Nearly all” of the engineers dedicated to building Just Walk Out were laid off on Wednesday, the senior team member who was let go said, leaving what they described as a skeleton crew to sustain the technology’s future. Amazon disputed that characterization as a “fabrication.” A handful of engineers and managers are left to maintain Just Walk Out, the former employee claims. Amazon’s checkout-less shopping tech, first introduced in 2016, uses cameras and sensors to track which items customers are buying. The e-commerce giant laid off several hundred employees from its AWS unit and Physical Stores Team on Wednesday, first reported by Geekwire . Our source says dozens of Just Walk Out team members were impacted. The layoffs could spell an uncertain future for hundreds of Amazon Go convenience stores, sports stadiums, and third-party retailers that rely on the technology. “Gizmodo’s story is wrong,” said an Amazon spokesperson. “We continue to invest heavily in our Just Walk Out team and technology, and have hundreds of employees working to keep up with the rapid demand.” Amazon disputes that this engineering team is now a skeleton crew, but did not clarify how many Just Walk Out engineers were laid off. Amazon had been planning internally to pull Just Walk Out from Fresh grocery stores for roughly a year, according to the former Amazon employee. They say the technology was too expensive and too complicated to run for large retail locations but seemed good enough for small convenience stores. These small shops are less complicated as they involve fewer products and fewer customers, so they’re easier to automate. However, the Just Walk Out team was blindsided when their unit was hit with layoffs, according to our source. Amazon says it will open more Just Walk Out stores in 2024 than any year prior, but the laid-off team member says the team that was responsible for developing the technology is largely gone. Amazon employees who were laid off Wednesday took to LinkedIn after the news. Gizmodo counted at least 15 Just Walk Out employees who are now “open to work.” One of the posts claims that half of their Just Walk Out team was laid off. A few of the team’s managers appeared to still be on staff, based on their LinkedIn profiles. Just Walk Out repeatedly failed at several internal metrics, the former senior team member claims. Most glaring, it never became truly autonomous. The checkout technology relied heavily on a team of human reviewers to label and verify purchases that its computers can’t, our source says. An India-based team labeled videos for AI training, a common practice in machine learning, but also verified videos of purchases flagged as “low-confidence events.” Amazon confirmed this but disputed what percentage of videos needed to be verified. At the launch of Just Walk Out, almost all the purchases required human review, according to our source. By mid-2022, The Information reported , 70% of purchases required review. Today, somewhere between 20% and 50% of purchases require human review, the former senior team member told Gizmodo; according to The Information’s reporting, Amazon’s internal goals wanted that number to be close to 5%. But there were other problems. Just Walk Out developed sensors that were more reliable than cameras for tracking purchases, however, they were way too expensive, according to our source. The former employee said Amazon aimed to bring the price of one sensor down to $100, but the engineering team could only bring it down to $350. “We’ve identified a few targeted areas of the organization we need to streamline in order to continue focusing our efforts on the key strategic areas that we believe will deliver maximum impact,” an Amazon spokesperson said in an email to Gizmodo this week. Amazon pioneered the automated retail space when it launched Just Walk Out in 2016. It was the biggest player then, and it still is today. Back then, this technology in grocery stores seemed too good to be true, and that still appears to be the case. Amazon now appears to be scaling back its aspirations. “Fully unstaffed grocery is probably not the right path,” said Steve Liguori, who co-founded another automated retail company, Juxta. “At least, not with the technology that’s out there today. That’s not the application for this tech.” Juxta focuses on small convenience stores, like most automated retailers in this tiny, but growing industry. The company claims to have a high degree of accuracy, but that’s partially because they ask customers to review their own receipts on a screen before they leave. It’s a more practical approach to automated retail, where the AI still has a low degree of confidence in many purchases. “When you’re shopping in a small convenience store, the maximum amount of products you’re picking up is around five or six,” said Ankur Sharma, CEO of another automated retail company, Brysk. “In a supermarket, you could pick up over 100 items,” continued Sharma, noting that this amount of data can overwhelm early machine-learning tools. Amazon’s venture into large supermarkets with an automated retail system was always seen as bold, according to Sharma and Liguori. Most competitors play in small convenience stores, but even there, the tech does not always have a high degree of confidence. However, Amazon is big enough that it can afford to take those kinds of risks. Internally, Just Walk Out was seen as a startup that could reap huge rewards if successful, according to our source. Ultimately, Amazon’s automated retail systems never fully removed humans from the loop, albeit, many more popular AI systems today don’t either . While the company doesn’t see this as a failure, it would be hard to see the alleged dissolution of its internal engineering team as anything else."

The Amazon page for Noem’s book, No Going Back: The Truth on What’s Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward , has a message for anyone wanting to leave a review of the book who has yet to buy it. It reads, “Amazon has noticed unusual reviewing activity on this product. Due to this activity, we have limited this product to verified purchase reviews.” First spotted by MeidasTouch News on Tuesday, the warning is Amazon’s way to slow down a fury of negative reviews that may not actually convey the quality of the book but instead be used by those who want to send a message of what they think about the author. “We want Amazon customers to shop with confidence knowing that the reviews they see are authentic and trustworthy,” an Amazon spokesperson said in an email Wednesday. “If we notice unusual reviewing activity, we will occasionally limit reviews to verified purchases only.” Noem’s book currently has a 2.2 rating on Amazon based on 7 reviews. Screenshots from MeidasTouch News appear to show there were far more reviews before Amazon changed the requirements for leaving a rating. It looks like Goodreads took a similar action by not allowing reviews for the book. Noem was considered one of the favorites to be Donald Trump’s VP pick . This wave of negative attention might put an end to any hope for that job, but Trump is always full of surprises."

    "article_content": "Amazon is reportedly releasing a generative AI version of Alexa later this year and plans to charge a monthly subscription fee separate from Amazon Prime for the technology, according to CNBC on Wednesday. It’s part of Amazon’s effort to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 Omni and Google’s Gemini 1.5 , which threaten digital assistants like Alexa. The new version of Alexa will reportedly be more conversational and updated with the latest in generative AI capabilities, but it won’t be free. CNBC reports that Amazon has not nailed down a price for the AI Alexa yet, but that the service would likely need a monthly subscription outside of the $139 a year Amazon Prime members pay. A source told CNBC that the estimated cost of using generative AI in Alexa is 2 cents per query, and mentioned a $20 per month price point that was floated internally. The report confirms several details about Amazon’s ambitions for Alexa that Business Insider reported in January. That previous report mentioned a June 30 launch deadline and a reported name for the technology, “Remarkable Alexa.” If true, Amazon would be announcing its AI Alexa the same month that Apple is expected to unveil an AI-enabled Siri. In a recent Letter to Shareholder s from CEO Andy Jassy, he mentioned a Gen AI upgrade coming for Alexa. As of 2023, Amazon has sold more than 500 million Alexa’s, but the technology has lost steam since its launch 10 years ago. While once seeming novel, Alexa now appears fairly limited as an assistant compared to modern AI competitors. Internally, CNBC reports that Jassy has made Alexa less of a priority since it wasn’t making significant revenue. One of CNBC’s sources also described Jassy’s frustration over an incident with Alexa where it couldn’t find the live score of a recent sporting event. Amazon pointed Gizmodo towards a blog post from Sept. 2023 titled “Previewing the future of Alexa” when asked about CNBC’s report. The blog post details a new Alexa based on a large language model that promises to be more conversational, useful, personalized, trustworthy, and even to have more personality. AI companies seem to be diverging around whether AI assistants should be personal, and it seems Amazon is saying yes to robot opinions. “As we’ve always said, the most boring dinner party is one where nobody has an opinion—and, with this new LLM, Alexa will have a point of view, making conversations more engaging,” Amazon said in the 2023 blog post. Last week, OpenAI and Google showcased how advanced their AI assistants can be, and it showed how much better Siri and Alexa will get this year. However, these AI assistants are costly to run, and it’s unclear if consumers find them valuable enough to justify the price."

SBF was planning to stay in New York while helping to prepare his appeal, but now, according to the report, he will be two and a half hours from his parents’ home near Stanford University. Mendota is a medium-security federal correctional institution and an adjacent minimum-security satellite facility. He has been imprisoned in a Brooklyn jail for the past nine months, where he also gave his first interview after receiving the jail sentence. According to the report, Bankman-Fried was informed of the transfer several days ago and was woken up early Wednesday morning for the move. Former cryptocurrency billionaire Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March for perpetrating one of the biggest financial frauds in history . He was convicted of fraud in the spectacular collapse of the crypto exchange FTX for stealing at least $10 billion from customers and investors. This article originally appeared on Quartz ."

    "article_content": "President Joe Biden vetoed a resolution late Friday that passed through both the U.S. House and Senate and was widely supported by the cryptocurrency industry. And it’s just the latest move from a president who’s put himself firmly in the crosshairs of powerful crypto forces who are dumping millions of dollars into ousting Biden in the upcoming 2024 presidential election. The resolution would have repealed the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which sought to force financial institutions that are holding crypto to keep the digital assets on their own balance sheets, as Coindesk recently explained. Biden called the effort to repeal the SEC decision a “Republican-led resolution,” though there were also Democrats who voted in favor. The president went on to say that the resolution would “inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to set forth appropriate guardrails and address future issues” and risked undercutting the SEC’s broader authority around various accounting practices. “My Administration will not support measures that jeopardize the well-being of consumers and investors,” Biden said in an announcement posted online by the White House. “Appropriate guardrails that protect consumers and investors are necessary to harness the potential benefits and opportunities of crypto-asset innovation. The veto angered plenty of crypto boosters online, including BowTieBill, a crypto newsletter. “Biden Veto tells you everything you need to know about your friends ‘in crypto,’” the account wrote . “If they vote for Biden they have no money invested and are lying about how much they have in the space. Vote Trump or Risk More political clown-politics.” That sentiment was shared by plenty of other accounts on X, which all seemed to paint Democrats as an existential threat to the survival of cryptocurrencies. “President Biden position on crypto will cost him more than he realizes,” another prominent bitcoin booster, Jason Williams, wrote on Friday . “It was a really bad decision to veto that bill. Especially at this critical time. Especially with Trump going all out crypto. Gg.” The Block reported as recently as last week that Biden’s administration was doing outreach in the crypto industry in what was characterized as a “tone shift,” around crypto. But the bitcoin bros aren’t just focused on the presidential race in the upcoming elections. Crypto super PACs are also planning to dump millions into U.S. Senate races in at least two states, Ohio and Michigan, according to recent reporting from the New York Times . The super PAC Fairshake already reportedly spent $10 million in the California primary earlier this year to ensure progressive Democrat Katie Porter lost over her skepticism around crypto issues. The California primary only allows two candidates in the final election, regardless of party, and Porter lost out in the second spot to a largely unknown Republican after attack ads were aimed squarely against her . Democrat Adam Schiff, who’s been friendly to crypto, won the top spot in the primary. Two other crypto super PACs, Protect Progress and Defend American Jobs, have also spent money on congressional races during this cycle. Protect Progress spent about $1.7 million to promote Democratic candidate Shomari Figures in one of Alabama’s seats for the U.S. House, according to the New York Times . Donald Trump, the convicted felon and presumed Republican candidate for president this November, has come out in favor of cryptocurrencies, despite expressing skepticism about the fake money years ago. Trump and Biden are neck-and-neck in the national polls, with a national average maintained by FiveThirtyEight showing Trump at 40.9% and Biden at 39.8%. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is polling at 9.7% in the national average. Biden stressed in his veto announcement that he was in favor of sensible regulation by the SEC, a clear signal that he’s not trying to make enemies of the crypto industry, no matter how it looks to crypto power players. “My Administration is eager to work with the Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities, which will promote the responsible development of digital assets and payment innovation and help reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system,” the Biden administration wrote."

    "article_content": "Donald Trump is embracing cryptocurrency ahead of the 2024 Presidential Election. The former President issued a rallying cry to Bitcoin miners this week to consolidate support from the crypto industry. Last month, his campaign began accepting crypto donations , calling the decentralized currency a reflection of Trump’s commitment to “freedom over socialistic government control.” “Bitcoin mining may be our last line of defense against a CBDC [Central Bank Digital Currency],” Trump said in a Truth Social post Tuesday. “Biden’s hatred of Bitcoin only helps China, Russia, and the Radical Communist Left. We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!!! It will help us be ENERGY DOMINANT!!!” The former President met with the country’s largest Bitcoin mining companies on Tuesday night, according to The New York Times and several photos posted by crypto executives. Trump may be hard-pressed for cash these days given his recent conviction , ongoing legal cases , and, oh yeah, the upcoming 2024 Presidential Election that’s less than five months away. The crypto community, which is searching for allies in D.C. to create friendlier policies, could offer a meaningful source of funding to Trump in this critical final stretch. Trump’s strategy around Bitcoin, which he says should be “MADE IN THE USA” and an opposition to “socialistic government control,” is all too familiar. The former President is positioning crypto as a decentralized way to invest in the MAGA movement. It’s not dissimilar from Truth Social’s stock, which became a way for day traders to invest in Trump through shares of DJT . He’s making these financial investments seem patriotic, but really they’re his path back to the Oval Office. Silicon Valley executives are increasingly gaining influence with Trump . Executives from Andreessen Horowitz are reportedly willing to spend tens of millions of dollars on crypto-friendly political campaigns, Puck reported in February. However, it’s unclear if any of this money has already gone to Trump directly. Tech venture capitalists David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya also just threw a fundraiser for Trump last week, which drew high-profile Bay Area executives and big donations. Donald Trump has flip-flopped on so many technology issues, that it’s hard to keep track of where he stands. He tried to ban TikTok while in office, but now he supports the app’s existence in America. Trump said he was “not a fan” of cryptocurrencies in 2019, but now it seems to be the currency of “freedom.” Many of Trump’s policies seem highly tied to where his potential fundraisers are. In 2024, it seems the Bitcoin community is poised to embrace Trump, and he’s framing the issue as existential to American ideals."

    "article_content": "Donald Trump recently called himself the “crypto president,” pulling a complete 180 from the days when he referred to crypto as a scam . And it’s causing quite a lot of confusion in an already hectic presidential race where the former president is neck-and-neck in the polls with President Joe Biden. Trump’s campaign now takes crypto donations , he tweets about wanting Bitcoin to be “MADE IN THE USA!!!” and some very wealthy people in the crypto community are throwing him fundraisers. But all of this hype has led to a very predictable outcome: Scammers are doing their best to capitalize on Trump’s newfound love of fake digital money. Some crypto watchers are convinced that TrumpCoin, launched on the Solana blockchain under the ticker $DJT, is actually the work of Trump himself. One prominent crypto news account on X, Pirate Wires, even says Trump’s son Barron is taking the lead on the project. “Per conversations, Trump is launching an official token — $DJT on Solana. Barron spearheading,” Pirate Wires tweeted on Monday . Mike Solana from Pirate Wires later clarified that he hadn’t spoken with the Trump campaign directly about $DJT while warning whoever’s behind the memecoin could “rug pull, or pivot.” It’s not entirely clear what “per conversations” meant in this case. Conversations with who? Your pillow just before you nod off to sleep? Others are even more skeptical of the idea that Trump is actually behind the new token. Far-right crypto influencer Ryan Selkis suggested to his followers that it might be some kind of psy-op orchestrated by the federal government. “I’m not 100% sure whether the Trump memecoin is real or an op, but I’m 50-50,” Selkis wrote on Monday . “I offered to help the people that reached out with legal and biz intros but told them I wouldn’t take anything in return because I got the vibes that the guy who approached me is a Fed. Stay safe!!!” That’s the fundamental problem with these kinds of anonymous cryptocoins. Cryptocurrencies are held up by supporters as a radical new form of money to fight the system. But the same anonymity that allows anyone to start their own coin from their home also requires anyone buying into the coin to have an enormous amount of trust. Are you sure the latest coin isn’t a honeypot set up by the feds? And if anyone should know whether the Trump coin is real, it would be Selkis. As the New York Times reported Monday, the influencer was dining at Mar-a-Lago just last month where he reportedly had a chat with the former president. The report from the Times also highlights the enormous amount of money that’s been donated by Ripple, Coinbase, and Andreessen Horowitz to crypto super PACs in their effort to fight against what they see as anti-crypto House and Senate candidates. One of those PACs, Fairshake, already ran TV and YouTube ads against Democratic congresswoman Katie Porter in the California Senate primary. Porter lost out to more crypto-friendly candidates, though it’s unclear how much Fairshake’s $10 million in attack ads really swung the result. Trump’s promotion of crypto has made for a target-rich environment, as people loyal to the former president are looking to cash in. Wired has a new report out Tuesday about different Trump-themed crypto scams that have surged in popularity over recent weeks. And while it’s not surprising given how common scams are these days on the internet, some of them are kind of funny. For instance, one scam looks exactly like Trump’s real fundraising website but has the domain donalbjtrump.com , misspelling the former president’s first name as “Donalb.” Any crypto “donations” to that site actually go straight to scammers, as you could guess. There’s no real evidence that Trump is launching his own coin, but that doesn’t mean he won’t. Fox Business (which would presumably have decent contacts in Trumpworld) recently reported that “sources in the industry say people affiliated with the former president have been planning to launch a digital coin for at least two months.” Obviously “people affiliated with the former president” is a wide pool of potential people, including a list of convicted criminals. But you never know. After all, Truth Social was only launched when two of Trump’s old associates from The Apprentice approached him with the idea. Amusingly, Trump is now suing those guys to try and claw back the money they’ve made on the project. The Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to questions about any potential cryptocurrency on Tuesday. Gizmodo will update this post if we hear back."

    "article_content": "A Chinese teenager has been returned to safety after being “cyber kidnapped.” Never heard of “cyber kidnapping”? Well, it’s an early front-runner for the hot new cybercrime trend of 2024. Police in the tiny community of Riverdale, Utah say that 17-year-old Chinese exchange student Kai Zhuang was the victim of a criminal plot in which online ghouls convinced him to trudge off into the mountains and stay there while they proceeded to extort his family out of tens of thousands of dollars. Riverdale police were initially contacted about Zhuang’s disappearance on Dec. 28th, when his high school reported him missing. School officials told authorities they had been contacted by the victim’s family, who said they had received a picture of him that indicated “he was abducted.” Police subsequently contacted Zhuang’s Riverdale host family, who told them that they had not realized he was missing and that he had been home just the previous evening. Zhuang’s real family in China told police they had surrendered as much as $80,000 to the criminals as part of an extortion plot connected to his disappearance. After working together with the FBI and Chinese authorities, local police searched the victim’s phone and financial records and found that he had recently visited a local canyon area. They subsequently launched a search and rescue mission in that area and found Zhuang in a tent in the mountains. Zhuang is described as having been “cold and scared,” with no heat source other than a blanket and “limited food and water.” He also had several phones, which police presumed were being used to communicate with the “cyber kidnappers.” The Riverdale PD’s press release provides additional details about this bizarre “cyber kidnapping” trend, in which criminals use online manipulation to isolate victims and proceed to convince their families that they are being forcibly held against their will. Police say they were briefed on the “disturbing criminal trend” by the FBI, who told them that this sort of thing has happened a number of times in the U.S. The press release reads: Cyber kidnappers have been targeting foreign exchange students, in particular, Chinese foreign exchange students. The kidnappers threaten the young foreign exchange students and their family, and they demand ransom. They tell the victim to isolate themselves and they monitor them through Facetime calls and or Skype. The cyber kidnappers convince the victim under duress to take pictures of themselves that make it appear they are being held captive and send the photos to their parents. The victims comply out of fear that their families will be harmed if they don’t comply with the cyber kidnappers. It all sounds pretty nefarious, though the entire criminal scheme seems to hinge on the victim being convinced that the “kidnappers” pose a legitimate threat. In short: If somebody calls you and tries to convince you to trek off into the mountains by yourself, my advice would be to promptly hang up and block their number. You’ll be saving yourself a whole lot of trouble."

    "article_content": "Mike Lindell is an entrepreneur. Unsatisfied with the MyPillow empire built on a product he literally invented in a dream, Lindell set out for political fame during the Trump administration. He’s spent years hawking bogus cures for COVID-19 and promoting feverish conspiracy theories about the 2020 election—some of which sparked a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit . Now the internet’s sweatiest pillow salesman is back with a new venture: he’s taking on Amazon. Over the past few days, Lindell has been on a media tour (mostly on extremist podcasts and his own video platforms) to promote a new eCommerce website called MyStore. Lindell calls it a “mini-Amazon” for “patriots” where “entrepreneurs” can sell their goods without being “copied by China.” There’s no word on how selling through MyStore will prevent “China” from copying you, aside from the fact that fewer people will see the website in the first place. Lindell did tell Newsweek that MyStore is only intended for American-made products, and his team has already caught sellers “trying to sneak in” Chinese wares. In an interview with convicted criminal Steve Bannon, Lindell said MyStore is home to “every kind of product you can imagine.” The website features all the patriot favorites, including the Amazing Temporary Tooth tooth replacement kit, “made in America” socks, a painting of a lion next to Jesus Christ, and a 32 ounce meat sticks and summer sausage variety pack. There are the Lindell classics too, including MyCoffee (with a free go-anywhere MyPillow if you sign up for a subscription), MyStore branded vitamins, MySlipper leather protectant spray, and, of course, the famous MyPillows themselves. If you act fast, you can even scoop up the limited edition 20th Anniversary MyPillow for just $27.98. The website doesn’t include any information about what separates the 20th Anniversary MyPillow from the regular MyPillow. This isn’t Lindell’s first expedition into online business. In 2021, the MyPillow king launched a free speech social media website called Frank (literally just the word “Frank”). Frank was supposed to be an “anything goes” platform free from the kind of draconian censorship that got Lindell “ canceled by Walmart .” The site is still running three years later, but it’s less social media and more a home for videos posted by Lindell’s buddies. Like most of the products Lindell offers, nearly everything in the MyStore is on sale. It’s a tactic that’s gotten him in trouble before. In 2017, the Better Business Bureau revoked MyPillow’s accreditation because of the product’s never-ending buy-one-get-one-free promotion. The BBB’s extremely loose guidelines include a stipulation that offers and discounts can only be available for a limited period of time, otherwise, you might be misleading people about the normal price of the product."

    "article_content": "Andrew Tate , the social media influencer with a huge following of teenage boys, has found himself in legal trouble again, and it’s for the dumbest reason. Tate, and his brother Tristan Tate, were detained Monday in Bucharest, Romania by UK police, according to a report from the BBC Tuesday. The arrest warrant for the Tates reportedly stems from an investigation into fresh allegations of rape and human trafficking. A Romanian judge ruled that the brothers can be extradited to the UK after the conclusion of their trial in Romania. The Tates have since been released from custody, once again. Both brothers are currently awaiting trial over separate charges of sex trafficking, rape, and forming a criminal group, which led to their arrest in December 2022 . The Tates were in jail for most of 2023, but they eventually were put under house arrest and then allowed to move freely within Romania . What led to the arrest of the Tates by the UK police is reportedly a clip from Adin Ross , a fellow influencer with legions of teen boy fans, who livestreamed a message from Tate saying he was going to “be leaving Romania soon and probably never coming back” and suggested Ross should come over to hang out, as reported by Rolling Stone . The implication was that Tate was going to go on the run. McCue Law, the firm representing the British women accusing Tate of rape and abuse, released a press release Tuesday confirming they received information of the Tates possibly leaving the country. The firm notified British police to seek an arrest warrant. Ross was instrumental in the rapid rise in popularity for Tate. He, along with the brothers, have done livestreams together for years as they drink liquor, smoke cigars, talk about women being trash, and reaffirm to their young audience how “alpha” they are because that’s what “alpha males” do."

    "article_content": "The New York Police Department plans to use drones to respond to some 911 calls in a new program, according to testimony delivered Thursday at a House Homeland Security Committee hearing in Washington, D.C. And while that’s concerning enough, one Republican congressman had some ideas about how to improve the idea. Specifically, he wants those new drones equipped with tasers. “Drones are absolutely a wonderful way... I think it saves lives. I think it saves officers’ lives. I’ll even take it to the next step and say eventually we should put non-lethal [weapons] on drones. Use one to tase somebody,” Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas said with a smile, according to a YouTube stream of the hearing. As you can see above, Nehls said all of this while wearing a tie with former president Donald Trump’s face on it, giving the entire exchange a surreal feeling. Nehls was previously a cop with the Richmond Police Department in Texas but was reportedly fired for a number of offenses, including destruction of evidence, according to Houston Public Media . Thursday’s congressional hearing, first reported by Gothamist , featured several high-ranking members of the NYPD, including Deputy Commissioner of Operations Kaz Daughtry, who explained that the police department currently has 85 drones in its fleet. The NYPD is outfitting drone landing platforms on precinct rooftops and will soon deploy the unmanned aerial vehicles in response to 911 calls. Details about the program are scarce, but Gothamist notes the plan is to use the drones in five New York precincts: three in Brooklyn, with one in the Bronx and one in Central Park. The drones aren’t used regularly yet, but their sporadic use has already been notable, with deployment up 420% in 2023 compared with 2022. As Gothamist points out, the drones have most recently been used to monitor pro-Palestinian protests in the city. Police departments in at least two wealthy California cities, Chula Vista near San Diego and Santa Monica near Los Angeles, launched their own drone programs last year. One promotional video about Santa Monica’s drone program even features real-world videos taken from above , showing the kind of surveillance that’s now possible for police. How close are we to seeing taser drones actually deployed by U.S. police departments? That part isn’t clear. Axon, the largest maker of taser products in the U.S., announced in 2022 that it was developing taser drones. But the company supposedly halted development after pushback from a majority of its ethics board, which resigned in protest . Axon’s founder and CEO, Rick Smith, gave hints recently that Axon was still very interested in developing taser drones to use in school shooter situations. And that’s obviously an area where the average person would probably consider the deployment of weaponized drones to be perfectly reasonable. The problem, of course, is that whenever police get new toys, they don’t just use them in the most extreme cases. And given this country’s trajectory, it’s way too easy to imagine a world where weaponized drones are responding to every 911 call. “Every police officer around the country would prefer to de-escalate high-risk situations,” Nehls said on Thursday in one of the more laughable statements of the hearing. “To achieve this objective, law enforcement needs to gain situational awareness of the threat safe face and drones provide real-time data in responding officers about the threat safe face and where they should respond.”"

    "article_content": "When it comes to Tesla, it seems like the only thing people want to talk about lately is the Cybertruck and its flaws . And while we can all have a laugh at that monstrosity on four wheels, the electric vehicle company has a problem with its growing parking lots of unsold Teslas in Austin, Texas. Telsa has struggled to sell cars recently, and those stockpiles are getting hard to hide, especially from satellites. Sherwood News used satellite imagery to compare parking lots of unsold Tesla stockpiles in October 2023 versus five months later in March 2024. The images show much fuller parking lots in March versus October. This confirms what Tesla’s Q1 earnings in April said; the company is producing significantly more cars than it’s selling. Tesla’s deliveries declined 8.5% from last year, and the company produced nearly 47,000 more cars than it sold. This was the first decline in sales since 2020 when the covid-19 pandemic forced Tesla to shutter production. The imagery from SkyFi paints a picture as to where these unsold Teslas are going: nowhere. The cars just sit in these parking lots until they’re shipped, according to Sherwood News. Jalopnik previously reported the Chesterfield Mall in St. Louis has been storing excess inventory for Tesla. Satellite images from SkiFi showed nearly 500 Teslas sitting there as of May 2024. Later this week, Tesla shareholders are slated to vote on Elon Musk’s nearly $50 billion pay package at the company’s annual shareholder meeting. In February, a Delaware judge struck down that pay package after finding Musk had extensive ties with board members who approved his pay deal. Not only will shareholders vote on Musk’s pay package, but also on whether to relocate Tesla outside of Delaware entirely, likely to get away from that judge. Meanwhile, Musk tweeted over the weekend that if any of his other companies go public, he will prioritize longtime Tesla shareholders. It’s unclear if that’s a hint that some company is actually going public soon or just a little nod to Tesla shareholders before the big vote. Either way, it’s clear Musk needs these folks on his side now more than ever, as Tesla struggles and he continues to grab power."

    "article_content": "A complaint that Tesla has misled consumers with the name of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Autopilot features, brought by the California Department of Motor Vehicles, will be allowed to go forward, according to a report from Bloomberg Monday. Tesla had previously defended the use of the term, which is now known as “Full Self-Driving (Supervised),” as a free speech issue . But an administrative judge ruled the complaint from the California DMV could continue on Monday, according to Bloomberg. The decision comes as Tesla faces federal investigations into FSD technology, which is often blamed when Tesla vehicles are involved in crashes. Officially, Tesla acknowledges that FSD doesn’t allow the average user to ignore the road completely, something that the average person would probably understand as a fully autonomous vehicle. But CEO Elon Musk has long been predicting that FSD will allow for completely autonomous transportation. And as recently as last week, he touted the latest version by suggesting it may be even more powerful than the name sounds. “FSD 12.4.1 releases today to Tesla employees,” Musk tweeted on June 5 . “If that goes well, then it will be released to a limited number of external customers this weekend. There are a massive number of changes to this build. It should arguably be called v13, but we’re sticking to 12.” Musk even claimed that soon people will be able to use FSD for as long as a year before a human needs to intervene, though he included a very important caveat. “Two other versions are in earlier stages of testing: 12.5 and 12.6, which could be called v14 and v15. We are starting to get to the point where, once known bugs are fixed, it will take over a year of driving to get even one intervention,” Musk wrote. Tesla didn’t immediately respond to questions emailed Monday afternoon. Gizmodo will update this post if we hear back."

    "article_content": "Waymo issued a voluntary recall of the driverless car company’s mapping software on Wednesday after an unoccupied vehicle hit a telephone pole while trying to pick up a passenger last month. The company tells Gizmodo it’s issuing an update to 672 vehicles and has filed a notice with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). News of the recall, first reported by The Verge , comes after an incident on May 21 when a Waymo driverless car was traveling to pick up a rider in Phoenix, Arizona. The car hit a light pole at 8 miles per hour, causing some damage to the vehicle but no injuries. “Following an event on May 21 in Phoenix, we have chosen to file a voluntary software recall with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to address a mapping and software issue,” a Waymo spokesperson said in a statement to Gizmodo on Wednesday. “We have already deployed mapping and software updates across our entire fleet, and this does not impact our current operations,” the spokesperson continued. “As we serve more riders in more cities, we will continue our safety first approach, working to earn trust with our riders, community members, regulators, and policymakers.” The Verge reports the problem with the software is that it “assigned a low damage score” to telephone poles. But Waymo didn’t elaborate on the specifics of the issue in the company’s statement to Gizmodo and didn’t immediately respond to follow-up questions. Wednesday’s recall is Waymo’s second ever. The last recall from the company was issued in February after two recent incidents. The first was in December 2023 when a Waymo vehicle in Phoenix made contact with a pickup truck “being towed backwards and at an angle relative to the towing vehicle,” according to a filing with the NHTSA and reported by Reuters . The second incident happened in February, when a Waymo vehicle hit a cyclist in San Francisco . Waymo was quick to stress in its statement that the current recall will have no impact on its operations."

    "article_content": "A Tesla in “self-driving” mode slammed into an unoccupied police car during the early morning hours of Thursday, according to the Fullerton Police Department. No one was injured in the crash, but bodycam footage shows a police officer sprinting out of the way to avoid getting hit. The officer in the footage was managing traffic in Fullerton at the intersection of W. Orangethorpe Ave. and Courtney Ave. after a deadly traffic accident involving a motorcyclist, according to a statement posted to Instagram by the Fullerton PD . “The police vehicle had its emergency lights on and several flares were placed on the road when a blue Tesla crashed into the police vehicle, which was blocking traffic,” the statement reads. “Thanks to the quick reaction of the police officer, who spotted the oncoming vehicle and swiftly moved to the side of the road, along with the off-duty police dispatcher who was riding with him, a potential disaster was averted,” the statement continued. The person behind the wheel of the Tesla has not been named, but police say he admitted to being on his cellphone during the crash, according to KTLA . The local TV news station aired footage of the aftermath, showing the wrecked Tesla and the police vehicle. The name of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature was recently changed to Full Self-Driving (Supervised), in an attempt to make it clear that drivers should not rely on the technology to keep them safe from crashes. But Tesla CEO Elon Musk has certainly been sending mixed messages on that front, including just yesterday at the Tesla shareholder’s meeting in Austin, Texas, where the billionaire touted just how safe FSD is supposed to be. Tesla did not respond to an email for comment about the accident. Tesla has previously defended itself from allegations that FSD isn’t safe by pointing to disclaimers that state drivers should always be paying attention to the road. “This incident underscores the importance of alertness and responsible driving,” Fullerton PD wrote, “Even in situations where the road is blocked and emergency lights are on.”"

    "article_content": "An internal Google database containing six years’ worth of potential privacy breaches and security issues was recently obtained, and reveals—among many other things—that a Google employee used their access to watch a private YouTube video uploaded by Nintendo and leaked the details online. On June 3, 404 Media reported that it had received a copy of a large Google-created database containing thousands of employee reports documenting various security and privacy issues involving customer data and content. According to the outlet, all of the information in the database was tracked from 2013 to 2018. Inside the database are stories of Google accidentally recording hundreds of kids speaking, inadvertently using Google Street View to catalog and store thousands of license plates, and exposing some Google Docs and Drive files as public even though they weren’t meant to be. Oops! But one of the sillier and less serious violations noted in the database might explain how some Nintendo announcements leaked a few years back. As reported by 404 Media in a follow-up report , in 2017 a contractor with admin access who had previously worked with Google used their privileges to download and watch an unreleased trailer for a then-unnamed Yoshi game. The trailer was marked as private on Nintendo’s YouTube channel. The contractor reportedly shared a screenshot of the trailer with a friend, who then published it to Reddit, where it was spotted by another Google employee. That person then reported the incident internally. According to an internal interview by Google , this incident was determined to be “non-intentional.” Below you can watch the trailer that was leaked early by a contractor. The game would later be named Yoshi’s Crafted World and would launch on Switch in 2019. Here’s Google’s statement that it provided to 404 Media about this database and the issues documented in it: At Google, employees can quickly flag potential product issues for review by the relevant teams. When an employee submits the flag they suggest the priority level to the reviewer. The reports obtained by 404 are from over six years ago and are examples of these flags—every one was reviewed and resolved at that time. In some cases, these employee flags turned out not to be issues at all or were issues that employees found in third party services. Individually, most of these issues are minor and were, to Google’s credit, fixed quickly. However, it’s not comforting that one of the largest tech companies in the world—which monitors and collects millions of people’s data every minute—is seemingly capable of doing such a shitty job at managing private information and content safely and securely.

    "article_content": "Alan Wake 2 was one of the best games of last year, and now players have a reason to start up the game again. And this time, it has very little to do with Alan Wake himself. Night Springs is a new DLC for Alan Wake 2 , and it will feature familiar characters to players of the “Remedyverse” games. Spanning over three “episodes” players will take control of The Waitress who looks like Rose Marigold from the games and is obsessed with Alan Wake, The Actor who looks like Sheriff Tim Breaker from Alan Wake 2, and The Sibling who bears a striking resemblance to Jesse Faden, the main character from 2019's Control . The trailer gives the impression that the characters of the DLC are supposed to be different than their in-game counterparts, to go along with the very Twilight Zone -like experience of Night Springs, which is an TV show feature in the Alan Wake games. It’s unclear how this new content will tie into the actual game as of right now. Sam Lake, the creative director and writer of the game, made the announcement on Friday’s Summer Game Fest, although the A lan Wake 2 Twitter account teased the news earlier in the week. Coming with the DLC on Saturday are a few new additions to the game such as new trophies and achievements for the DLC and a Photo Mode. Lake also revealed that there will be pre-orders for physical editions of Alan Wake 2 . The Deluxe Edition comes with the game and different in-game skins and outfits, and it comes out on Oct. 22 for $80, according to Venture Beat . There’s also a Limited Collector’s Edition of the game made by Limited Run Games, and it will include the Deluxe Edition content, a Collector’s Edition box, a replica of the Angel Lamp from the game, an Ocean View Hotel Keychain and key, a Coffee World pin set and an Alan Wake 2 artbook. The limited edition comes out in November and will cost $200. Alan Wake 2's Night Springs DLC comes out on Saturday for PS5, Xbox Series consoles, and Epic Games Store. The new content is part of the game’s Expansion Pass, which was included with the deluxe edition of Alan Wake 2 . Those with the standard edition can pay the $20 for the upgrade."

    "article_content": "As Apple eulogized its commitment to purportedly non-invasive AI during its annual developer conference, the iPhone maker neglected to disclose a critical update that’s coming to the next evolution of its Mac operating system — macOS Sequoia. Alongside an iPhone mirroring feature and Safari AI summaries , early users of macOS 15 beta say they’ve spotted the first upgrade to Apple’s Mac Chess game since 2012. As 9to5Mac first reported, Apple last updated the Chess app a dozen years ago, back when it still named its Mac operating system releases after big cats. With OS X Mountain Lion, Apple added Game Center support to Chess, along with a glossy background and some other small additions laid out in an ancient AppleInsider post . The app’s 2012 upgrade looked like this, per AppleInsider. The following year, Apple said it ran out of big cats and started naming Mac updates after “inspiring” places in California. In the years since, Apple kept its built-in Chess app around but neglected to update it until now. The latest version of Chess for Mac features shinier and more realistic-looking pieces as well as a textured, gradient background. However, 9to5Mac reports that the revamped game includes fewer themes. The update specifically punts a rather gritty-looking grass theme option , though it’s technically possible that Apple has other changes coming to the app before macOS Sequoia exits beta and sees a wider release."

    "article_content": "Friday is when the Shadow of the Erdtree drops, and it’s already shaping up to be some of the best DLC ever released for a game. In preparation for the big release, Elden Ring received a new update with a variety of changes, but the big one is adding your bestie to the fight with the last boss. Torrent is now available to be summoned in the battle with the Elden Beast, according to the patch notes released on Thursday. Players of the game will appreciate the inclusion of their favorite horse as the Elden Beast has some big attacks that require a lot of running if you want to defend yourself. Along with adding support for Shadow of the Erdtree, Thursday’s update includes a wide range of changes for Elden Ring . What’s been added are new hairstyles and some changes to the user interface for the map and your inventory. There was also a slew of balance adjustments made to weapons, skills, spells, and items, which will likely lead to a rethinking of the meta for player-vs-player battles. Developer FromSoftware also added bug fixes, which mainly consisted of changes to attacks, skills, and items that had unintended effects. Bandai Namco also released a new trailer for Shadow of the Erdtree showcasing some of the new bosses players will face in the DLC. It hints at some of the big reveals fans are anticipating when they explore the Shadow Realm. Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree comes out on Friday at midnight ET. It’ll cost $39.99 and will be available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series consoles, and PC. As is the case with most DLC, a copy of Elden Ring is needed in order to play Shadow of the Erdtree ."

    "article_content": "In a turn of events that will likely shock no one, it turns out that the OnlyFans model who recently went viral for flashing the New York City “portal” has a habit of doing outlandish things to get attention. In previous years, Ava Louise, 25, went viral for licking an airplane toilet seat and, prior to that, for telling Dr. Phil that she’d rather “die hot than live ugly.” Suffice it to say she is willing to go to any length—no matter how disruptive or depraved—to drive interest to her business. Louise, whose OF bio remarks “Yes, I do sex tapes!”, managed to cause quite a ruckus this week when she flashed “the portal ”—a weird art installation that is basically a giant webcam connecting the cities of New York and Dublin (Ireland) via a live video feed. Louise is credited with getting the portal temporarily deactivated (she, in fact, bragged about this on her Instagram ) but, in truth, she is only one of numerous people who have been abusing the goofy art installation for yuks, to the point where officials recently decided to pull the plug on it . Other people have reportedly used the portal to share videos of 9/11, dick pics, and porn. Given that the project basically resembles a giant phone screen, it makes sense that people would use it to spam each other with much of the same content that proliferates via texting. Anyway, as previously noted, Louise is a well-trained provocateur. Back in 2020, she managed another amazing brand promotion when she posted a TikTok video of herself licking a toilet seat. The seat, she said, was on a plane, and she dubbed it the “Coronavirus Challenge.” Louise later explained away this behavior by claiming that the toilet was, in fact, located on a private jet belonging to her sugar daddy and was, thus, sanitary. Prior to that, she was a regular guest on Dr. Phil , a show known for its stunningly sophisticated conversations about celebrity and mental health. There, Louise chatted with the good doctor about stuff like “wanting to be Insta-famous,” being too focused on “being hot,” and, as previously stated, the preference to “die hot than live ugly.” To Louise’s credit, her appearances on the show are quite funny, though I’m going to hazard a guess that whatever advice the celebrity therapist attempted to impart had a negligible effect. As for the portal, it still appears to be down. Gizmodo reached out to the Flatiron Nomad Business Improvement District, one of the organizations behind the portal, for information about when it may be up and running again but didn’t receive an immediate response."

    "article_content": "Roger Corman, one of the most prolific, influential filmmakers of all time, died last weekend at the age of 98 . Prominently known for his campy, 1960s horror films (his nickname was “King of the B’s”), Corman was far more than a small-time B-movie director. He helped launch the careers of droves of actors and filmmakers who would go on to become some of the most prominent, influential people in Hollywood (Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson, and Francis Ford Coppola are just a few who got their start on Corman’s dime). Sure, there may be some haters out there (I’m looking at you, Paul Schrader ), but, on the whole, Corman can be remembered as a titanic force in the entertainment industry, responsible for unleashing a veritable tsunami of filmmaking. According to the Academy of Motion Pictures , he produced more than 300 films and has directing credits on at least 50. He also founded New World Pictures, which released many cult classics throughout the 1970s and ‘80s. To celebrate Corman, you click through and check out a few of the most notable movies he directed, produced, or financed. 2 / 19 One of Corman’s early movies that displayed his characteristic mixture of camp, humor, and creepiness, A Bucket of Blood is about a beatnik whose accidental killing of his landlady’s cat transforms him into an actual murderer. 3 / 19 Corman notably directed the “Poe cycle”—a sequence of eight movies based on the stories of Edgar Allen Poe—and The Fall of the House of Usher is one of the more memorable in that sequence. It features a performance by the always-great Vincent Price. 4 / 19 Another Poe movie worth watching, Corman’s Pit and the Pendulum brings Price back to the big screen for more creepy action. 5 / 19 Yet another film in Corman’s Poe cycle, The Raven is more comedic than scary but it’s still a worthy entry in the filmmaker’s oeuvre. 6 / 19 Corman produced the first film ever made by Francis Ford Coppola. Dementia-13 is a low-budget horror film about murder and marital strife. Coppola would use his time with Corman to hone skills he later used to make some of the most popular movies of all time. 7 / 19 Considered one of the finest of Corman’s “Poe cycle,” The Masque of the Red Death is a great-looking movie and yet another fun performance from Price. 8 / 19 Another Poe movie, this film features an early screenplay by Robert Towne, who would later go on to write Chinatown . 9 / 19 This biker movie directed by Corman stars Peter Fonda, features a script partially written by Peter Bogdanovich, and has heavy counterculture vibes. A very fun watch. 10 / 19 Corman’s mid-Sixties film about Al Capone and other gangsters in the Twenties includes early performances by then relatively unknown actors Jack Nicholson and Bruce Dern. 11 / 19 A precursor to Easy Rider , this trippy counterculture Corman film was written by Jack Nicholson and is all about LSD. What’s not to like? 12 / 19 Corman produced this first movie directed by Peter Bogdanovich, who would go on to become a prominent member of the New Hollywood movement. Bogdanovich later directed several classics, including The Last Picture Show and Paper Moon . 13 / 19 Corman’s crime exploitation picture about a real-life woman who helped her bank-robbing sons carry out their crimes features an early performance by a young Robert de Niro and also stars Shelley Winters and Bruce Dern. 14 / 19 Corman produced Bertha , one of Martin Scorsese’s first features. The film would help establish Scorsese before he rocketed to fame with his next film, Mean Streets . 15 / 19 Corman helped finance Ingmar Bergman’s 1972 movie about three sisters dealing with death. Corman later distributed the picture in the U.S. through his New World Pictures production company. The film would go on to win a number of Academy Awards. 16 / 19 Corman produced this early film by Jonathan Demme (of The Silence of the Lambs ), an exploitation movie about female convicts in prison. 17 / 19 Fondly remembered as one of the best B-movies to come out of Corman’s New World Pictures studio, Death Race 2000 stars David Carradine (of Kung Fu ) as a racer involved in a dystopian...well, death race. 18 / 19 Frankenstein Unbound was the last film that Corman personally directed. 19 / 19"

    "article_content": "Silicon Valley has always been a place for unconventional thinkers with big ideas, but in 2024, that includes former president and convicted felon Donald Trump . Two influential tech investors and hosts of the All-In Podcast , David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya, recently announced they were hosting a fundraiser for Trump on Thursday. They join other tech leaders, including Elon Musk, who have signaled support for Trump and a growing disdain for President Biden. “I know there’s gonna be a lot of people who support Trump, but they don’t want to admit it,” said Sacks on Friday’s episode of All-In . “I think this event is gonna break the ice on that, and maybe it will create a preference cascade where, all of a sudden, it becomes acceptable to acknowledge the truth, which is a lot of people support Trump.” Sacks, who helped announce Florida Governor Ron Desantis’ 2024 Presidential campaign on X , is no stranger to the Republican party. However, Palihapitiya is one of many Silicon Valley influencers who recently became more friendly to conservative candidates. While he’s voted for Democrats in the past, he considers himself an “apolitical person” who simply wants to hear Trump out. Palihapitiya’s fundraising efforts may also be an attempt to grow All-In’s audience and authority. What started as a podcast is slowly growing into a well-funded media empire, which recently hired its first CEO. This seems to be a trend among Silicon Valley leaders, who are increasingly seeking influence over America’s political and ideological sphere – and they often lean right. “I would like this to be a place where impartiality rules,” Palihapitiya said about All-In . “And I would like, four years from now, for every major political candidate for President to look at All-In as the first place.” Every attendee at the Sacks and Palihapitiya’s fundraiser will donate roughly $300,000 to Trump’s campaign, according to Bloomberg . The other “besties,” as the All-In podcasters refer to themselves, Jason Calacanis and David Friedberg, noted they wouldn’t attend and clarified this wasn’t an All-In fundraiser, but were happy their platform fostered a variety of opinions. Sacks said on Friday’s podcast that the former President may soon be a guest on All-In . However, they aren’t the only ones cozying up to Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Trump discussed a possible advisory role for Elon Musk if he’s elected. Trump and Musk’s relationship has varied over the years, but now they reportedly talk on the phone several times a month. Musk’s X gives a platform to conservative speech in a similar way that Truth Social does – he even reinstated Trump’s X account , although the former president has yet to use it. The relationship seems tense, however, since Trump is threatening to slam the brakes on electric vehicles in America. Investor Marc Andreessen is also looking to throw his political weight around, though he hasn’t explicitly endorsed Trump. Andreessen is more active in politics than ever these days, according to a report from Puck , where sources said his firm has put tens of millions of dollars towards crypto-friendly regulations. Perhaps that’s why Trump’s campaign just started embracing crypto . Just hours after the former President was found guilty on 34 counts in his hush money trial, Sequoia partner Shaun Maguire announced on X he was donating $300,000 to Trump. “The timing isn’t a coincidence, ” he tweeted. Maguire wrote a lengthy post detailing his “radicalization towards the center” thanks to the Biden administration’s foreign policy and other issues. “There’s a real chance President Trump is convicted of felony charges and sentenced to prison,” Maguire said . “Bluntly, that’s part of why I’m supporting him. I believe our justice system is being weaponized against him.” Silicon Valley’s current batch of tech bros aligns with the Republican party far more than they used to. As tech gets wealthier, conservative policies that favor a limited government and reduced taxation on the rich are becoming more popular in the industry. Not to mention, the San Francisco Bay Area has been battered by homelessness and drug issues. Many in tech feel that Democrats’ light-handed approach has been ineffective here, and conservative policies are now speaking to them. Identity politics are also common ground. Tech bros were outspoken during the ousting of Harvard President Claudine Gay , where they all made sure to note how adamantly they opposed Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies. Covid-19 is another issue that Republicans and tech bros largely align on. On Friday, the All-In podcast expressed a sense of vindication after Dr. Anthony Fauci’s Congressional hearing, where Republican Congress members peppered the former Chief Medical Advisor on the origins of covid-19. While some of these issues are modern, many of them have existed for a while. It’s possible Biden, who isn’t a notably strong candidate for Democrats, is pushing many towards Trump. Or maybe some of these issues are truly reaching a breaking point. Regardless, many Silicon Valley elites are now willing to look past their moral gripes with Trump if it means winning on these issues. To quote Apple, there seems to be a “think different” attitude across all of these political stances, fueled by the same contrarian opinions that have always flourished in tech. However, the industry has historically “thought differently” to the left. Google’s Sergey Brin denounced a gay marriage ban in 2008 and billionaire investor Reid Hoffman has become notorious for funding Democrats . Now, the contrarian voices are shifting right. It’s not like Trump was their first choice though. The All-In besties previously held fundraisers and conversations with RFK Jr., Dean Phillips, and Vivek Ramaswamy while Sacks previously lent a helping hand to Desantis. But those candidates didn’t have a real shot at the White House, and Trump does. Tech figures like Musk, Maguire, Andreessen, and the All-In besties are becoming more influential political and ideological voices in America. Silicon Valley has quickly become the center of American innovation and wealth, and with it, comes a newfound influence. They’ve got money to spend, and Trump needs it. The former President has already shown he’ll do anything to win, so he may bend to tech’s demands and give Silicon Valley more influence than ever."

    "article_content": "Open your kitchen drawer and take out some tin foil. Twirl it into a cone – maybe even double-wrap it – and put it on your noggin. Do you feel safer yet? The tin foil hat is perhaps the most iconic headgear for conspiracy theorists. Wearing one signals to others that you’re unhinged, have a deep distrust of the government, or that you’re really worried about aliens. To some, it’s a way to block a centralized power’s electromagnetic waves from entering your brain. Where does this myth come from, and is there any actual science to it? The tin-foil hat can be traced back to 1927, first spotted by Business Insider roughly a decade ago, in a short story titled “ The Tissue-Culture King. ” It’s a strange short story written by Julian Huxley, whose brother Aldous was a prolific writer and author of Brave New World . It was Julian, however, who was possibly the first to mention wrapping your cranium in foil. In the story, a scientist called Hascombe gets lost in a jungle and is captured by a local tribe. He ultimately starts practicing mass mind control, eventually using it on the tribe’s king to coordinate his escape. But how does Hascombe avoid having his mind controlled? It reads: Well, we had discovered that metal was relatively impervious to the telepathic effect, and had prepared for ourselves a sort of tin pulpit, behind which we could stand while conducting experiments. This, combined with caps of metal foil, enormously reduced the effects on ourselves... We with our metal coverings were immune. As Vice notes, the story ends on a somewhat conspiratorial note, asking the reader whether they’re one of “those who labor because they like power, or because they want to find the truth about how things work.” As we approach the 100-year anniversary of the tin foil hat, the story’s sentiment still feels relevant to many conspiracy theorists today, offering a generally paranoid and skeptical worldview. Even though “tin foil hat” is the expression, most people use aluminum foil these days. The U.S. Foil Company (the parent of Reynolds) first introduced aluminum foil in 1926 , and it almost immediately replaced all tin foil on supermarket shelves around the country. Aluminum was thinner, lighter, and ultimately better for wrapping food. Brain protection, however, doesn’t seem to have been a factor in the switch though. There have been relatively few experiments done on the true effectiveness of tin foil hats – most likely because of their ridiculous premise – but the question remains. Could a hat of foil block electromagnetic waves from touching your brain? The idea is that the metal acts as a Faraday cage , which blocks certain wavelengths from passing through. In 2005, a group of four cheeky MIT graduate students set out to answer the question with, “On the Effectiveness of Aluminium Foil Helmets: An Empirical Study.” “One afternoon, we had a really stupid idea,” Benjamin Recht, one of the four authors of the MIT study , said in an interview with Gizmodo. “We were in a lab with very expensive equipment and just decided to use that, like, $200,000 piece of equipment to test whether or not aluminum foil hats prevented radio waves from going in.” Recht went on to be a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. When Gizmodo reached Recht’s former professor at MIT in 2005, who oversaw the lab the experiment took place in, he emailed back, “That was a joke, which got taken surprisingly seriously.” In the jokey study, the authors say: It has long been suspected that the government has been using satellites to read and control the minds of certain citizens. The use of aluminum helmets has been a common guerrilla tactic against the government’s invasive tactics [1] . Surprisingly, these helmets can in fact help the government spy on citizens by amplifying certain key frequency ranges reserved for government use. In addition, none of the three helmets we analyzed provided significant attenuation to most frequency bands. Recht says the study shouldn’t be given any credibility and was mostly a joke at the expense of anyone who wears these helmets. Nevertheless, they wrote that tin foil hats were ineffective at blocking most wavelengths. They genuinely did test three helmet types: The Classical, The Fez, and the Centurion. The authors even offer their own conspiracy theory, writing about how tin foil hats amplify certain waves reserved for government communications: The helmets amplify frequency bands that coincide with those allocated to the US government between 1.2 Ghz and 1.4 Ghz. According to the FCC, These bands are supposedly reserved for ‘’radio location’’ (ie, GPS), and other communications with satellites (see, for example, [3] ). The 2.6 Ghz band coincides with mobile phone technology. Though not affiliated by government, these bands are at the hands of multinational corporations. It requires no stretch of the imagination to conclude that the current helmet craze is likely to have been propagated by the Government, possibly with the involvement of the FCC. We hope this report will encourage the paranoid community to develop improved helmet designs to avoid falling prey to these shortcomings.﻿ Though it wasn’t exactly clear to everyone that this was a joke, Recht notes how this paper went viral at the time. It first popped up on Slashdot, which he describes as the Hacker News of its day. Years later, The Atlantic wrote up the study. But the story has continued to pop up in strange places over the years, as often happens when people engage with conspiracy theories. “It was a weird thing that kind of took on a weird life of its own,” Recht said, noting how some tin foil hat wearers may have taken the experiment a little too seriously. “We got some weird emails and... there are people out there who definitely have opinions and access to computers, and they definitely sent us some thoughts. So, you know, it’s definitely real all the popular conspiracies people buy into.” While Recht can’t vouch for the study, it seems likely that tin and aluminum foil hats are not effective Faraday cages. As Dr. Michelle Dickenson points out , Faraday cages need to fully surround the items they protect. Because a foil hat only covers the top of your head, it leaves a lot of room for electromagnetic waves to get in through the bottom. Before you go wrapping your entire head in foil, remember that even in a perfect lab environment, Faraday cages can be difficult to create. Since 1926, conspiracy theories have only grown more intense throughout society. The emergence of 5G towers has fueled a newfound fear of electromagnetic radiation , spurring a resurgence in modern products promising Faraday cage abilities to protect people from the so-called dangers. These include 5G blocking beanies and hats , which seem like a modern-day tin-foil hat that promises protection without the ridicule. Ranging anywhere from $30 to $65, these are much more expensive than the aluminum foil in your kitchen drawer. The internet is great at propping up conspiracies like this. Message rooms and Facebook groups become echo chambers for outlandish ideas. The tin foil hat may be an extreme version of this, but it happens in small bursts all the time. In the last few months, cell outages , the Baltimore Key Bridge collapse , and a solar eclipse have spurred fresh crops of conspiracies for the internet to feast on. They all center around a collective distrust of what the media and government say. But the truth is, there’s really no evidence that a centralized power is trying to control your brain through electromagnetic waves entering your brain stem. If you really want to protect your brain from being controlled by a centralized power, it might do you much better to get off your devices and social media. The electromagnetic waves radiating from those conspiracy channels seem to be doing more harm than anything else."

    "article_content": "President Biden signed the TikTok ban into law on Wednesday, forcing China-based Bytedance to sell the app or face a ban in American app stores. TikTok tells Gizmodo it will fight the law in court, a case likely to reach the Supreme Court, saying that Biden’s law “tramples” First Amendment protections. In interviews with Gizmodo, legal experts say TikTok has a point. “My analysis of any situation changes the moment I hear it’s for national security, because usually, that’s a sign it’s a bullshit law,” said First Amendment attorney Marc Randazza in an interview with Gizmodo. “I don’t allow TikTok in my house, but I can’t constitutionally fathom a rationale for banning it in the United States.” Lawyers tell Gizmodo that a forced sale or ban of TikTok impacts the speech of three significant players: TikTok itself as a publisher; TikTok’s users, who use the app to speak with each other; and the App Stores that carry TikTok, just as book stores are free to carry whatever books they like. Limiting any of this speech would require pretty significant offenses on behalf of TikTok. So far, Congress has not provided new evidence, only citing “ classified briefings ” for this law. But let’s go down the laundry list of Congress’ allegations. U.S. Senator Mark Warner called TikTok a “ propaganda tool ” of the Chinese Communist Party in a CBS interview on Sunday. Countless other U.S. lawmakers say this, claiming TikTok not only spreads Chinese propaganda but also pro-Hamas messaging, with the goal of sowing disinformation among America’s youth. This all could be true, but propaganda is not illegal. “The First Amendment protects foreign government propaganda, which sounds a little weird, but that’s just the way it is,” said Eric Goldman, Professor of Law at Santa Clara University in an interview with Gizmodo. “Propaganda is both constitutionally protected and something the U.S. government engages in extensively itself, which undermines any of the justifications the government might offer.” Americans have the right to hear dissenting opinions, including propaganda, and make their own judgments. That’s a foundational piece of the First Amendment, so that argument will likely fall flat on its face. Another argument against TikTok is over the app’s alleged data collection practices, which could be a better case. U.S. Congressman Michael McCaul called TikTok “ a spy balloon in Americans’ phones, ” alleging the app scrapes the personal information of 170 million American users to share with the Chinese government. In 2021, The Information reported that the CCP took a seat on Bytedance’s board , which some see as evidence enough that TikTok is spying on Americans. However, Congress only cites “classified briefings” to hold up these claims. “I’m more likely to believe this is a big bag of nothing because of the extent to which TikTok has been tried already,” said Goldman. “In previous cases, the government has provided evidence to judges under seal, and those judges still ruled in favor of TikTok. The judges who have seen some of the evidence at issue found it unconvincing.” Congress members described these classified briefings on TikTok’s data collection practices as “shocking” revelations of the app’s ability to track and spy. TikTok vehemently denies that it shares data with China, claiming it spent over $1.5 billion under Project Texas to house American data within the United States. A potential court case will bring some of this information to light, but national security cases have a tendency to steamroll the constitutional rights of Americans with little public information. “If the justification is national security, that rationale has never worked out all that well for regulation,” said Randazza. “The route here for regulators is probably privacy, but the problem with doing that is we’ve already given up so much of that right to privacy to Silicon Valley.” We already know that homegrown apps track and spy on our behavior because the U.S. has no comprehensive data privacy law . China likely doesn’t need TikTok to get American data, and it could theoretically go through much simpler means, such as data brokers. These companies purchase American data from Silicon Valley and sell them to third parties, one of which was recently revealed to be the U.S. government’s own National Security Agency . Ultimately, legal experts agree with TikTok that a government-mandated sale or ban of a social media app inhibits the free speech of many players. The U.S. government will need strong evidence that TikTok is no angel in this case, or else, the law may not hold up in court."

    "article_content": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) killed net neutrality back in 2017 under former president Donald Trump, but on Thursday, it brought it back from the dead. Net neutrality—the principle that internet providers should treat all traffic equally and not throttle or block certain traffic for whatever reasons—is once again in effect after the FCC voted 3-2 in favor of its return . This reinstates the policies first established in 2015 that regulate telecom companies and prohibit the blocking or throttling of certain, lawful content. Along with preventing internet providers from throttling or blocking traffic, the FCC also added language to stop the companies from prioritizing certain traffic. Thanks to 5G technology, telecom companies can do what’s called network slicing , which can create multiple virtual subnetworks and prioritize certain 5G customers over others depending on whether they paid for a premium subscription to the provider. The rules back in 2015 didn’t put a focus on this concept since 5G wasn’t around back then like it is today. The FCC will also be able to stop foreign-owned entities that may pose a threat to national security from operating broadband networks. And if networks go down preventing workers, businesses, or even students from doing their work, the commission can get involved. As expected, internet providers are not going to take this lying down and will pursue the options available to them to stop net neutrality from happening. “This is a nonissue for broadband consumers, who have enjoyed an open internet for decades,” Jonathan Spalter, the president of a broadband lobbying group, USTelecom, told the New York Times Thursday."

    "article_content": "On Tuesday, TikTok fired back against the U.S. government over a law that could put an end to the social video platform . TikTok and its parent company Bytedance’s lawsuit against the federal government claims the legislation circumvents the First Amendment. The company says the law’s requirement for TikTok to be divested is “not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.” “There is no question: the Act will force a shutdown of TikTok by January 19, 2025, silencing the 170 million Americans who use the platform to communicate in ways that cannot be replicated elsewhere,” TikTok said in the petition filed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act targeted TikTok, labeling it as a “foreign adversary controlled application.” TikTok has 270 days from when the act was signed by President Biden to either sell the app to an entity in the U.S. or face a shutdown . There are groups interested in buying the popular social video app, but the company has said that it’s not for sale. The House of Representatives and the Senate swiftly passed the legislation back in April as part of the National Security Act , which provided additional funding to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. While the law does focus on TikTok, legal experts say the b an could affect other apps as well. “There’s plenty of room here for creative interpretation for how someone could be in a foreign country calling the shots without being an owner,” Evan Brown, a Chicago-based lawyer with a focus on technology, told Gizmodo back in March. “The President really has the unchecked power to put another app on this list.”"

    "article_content": "California is another state lining up to pass a law requiring adult sites to verify the ages of porn watchers . The California State Assembly passed the Parent’s Accountability and Child Protection Act that will require porn companies doing business in the state to verify that users are 18 years or older. This law would also affect other businesses such as fireworks, body branding, and even BB guns. Democrat Rebecca Bauer-Kahan and Republican Juan Alanis pushed for passage of the bill, which ended up receiving 65 out of possible 80 yes votes, and zero no votes with 15 assembly members listed as not voting. Before the bill becomes law, it still has to pass the State Senate and then be signed by Governor Gavin Newsom. Louisiana was the first state to pass an age verification law for adult sites in 2022. In the past year, several other states jumped on the bandwagon including Utah, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. One of the largest porn sites around, Pornhub, has taken issue with the age verification laws passed by the states. The company has instead pulled out of those states requiring verification. “As you may know, your elected officials in Texas are requiring us to verify your age before allowing you access to our website,” reads a message Porhub visitors in Texas find when clicking on the site. “Unfortunately, the Texas law for age verification is ineffective, haphazard, and dangerous. Until the real solution is offered, we have made the difficult decision to completely disable access to our website in Texas.” Aylo, Pornhub’s parent company, says it supports age verification, but “we believe that any law to this effect must preserve user safety and privacy, and must effectively protect children from accessing content intended for adults.” The company says that users who are required to verify their age instead go visit other sites that don’t comply with state law. “In Louisiana last January, Pornhub was one of the few sites to comply with the new law. Since then, our traffic in Louisiana dropped approximately 80 percent,” the company said in an emailed statement to Gizmodo on Thursday. “These people did not stop looking for porn. They just migrated to darker corners of the internet that don’t ask users to verify age, that don’t follow the law, that don’t take user safety seriously, and that often don’t even moderate content. In practice, the laws have just made the internet more dangerous for adults and children.”"

    "article_content": "Former president Donald Trump tried to cozy up with the Libertarian Party on Saturday, but it didn’t go well . As boos and chants of “End the Fed” filled the convention during his speech, there were two campaign promises that brought cheers from the crowd: commuting the sentence of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht and protecting crypto. “He’s already served 11 years, we are going to get him home,” Trump told the crowd. Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 after he was revealed to be the person running the notorious online marketplace, Silk Road. His pardoning has become a cause for Libertarians who view his life sentence as an outlandish punishment for what some claim to be just a guy who helped others sell drugs like Adderall online. “It’s one of the things we wanted from his first term,” Katherine Yeniscavich, a national committee member of the party, told Politico . “He wants Libertarian voters, and if he agreed to free Ross he would get a lot of votes.” Of course, these people ignore the evidence that Ulbricht commissioned multiple hits against his enemies. Prosecutors said no one was ever killed but the allegations eventually played a role in his sentencing. Trump also tried to win favor with Libertarians by focusing on cryptocurrency, in general. “I will also stop Joe Biden’s crusade to crush crypto,” Trump told the crowd. “We’re going to stop it. I am going to ensure that the future of crypto and the future of Bitcoin will be made in the USA and not driven overseas.” Trump’s campaign said last week it would begin accepting crypto donations . While he might not be a crypto bro, there are multiple crypto coins that reference “MAGA” and “Trump,” and his campaign has sold NFTs . A wallet reportedly linked to Trump has a value of more than $10 million , according to a report from The Block."

    "article_content": "American political parties usually make a big production out of nominating their presidential candidate, but not this year. The Democratic Party plans to nominate President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris over Zoom, according to CBS News , ahead of a previously scheduled convention in late August. The virtual nomination is the product of a partisan spat amongst Ohio legislators who have failed to reach a deal that will get the sitting President on the ballot this fall. Currently, Ohio has an Aug. 7 ballot certification deadline, which means Biden will not be on the state’s ballot if he waits to be nominated until the 2024 Democratic National Convention taking place in Chicago from Aug. 19 - 22. Instead of moving the convention, or Ohio changing its deadline, the Democratic Party is having a virtual nomination beforehand. “Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree. But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own,” DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement to CBS. “Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can’t chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice.” The nomination is purely a formality at this point since President Biden has widely been expected to be the 2024 nominee for some time. However, the Zoom nomination would be a repeat of 2020 when Biden and Harris were virtually chosen as the Democratic Party’s nominees due to pandemic restrictions. CBS reports that the Chicago convention will still take place in late August, despite the virtual nomination. The incident reveals deep divisions within Ohio’s legislature, which failed to create a quick fix for Biden’s ballot problem. Republicans proposed a bill that would move the Ohio deadline back but paired it with a provision that would ban foreign contributions to ballot initiatives that Democrats rejected. Ultimately, the “let’s just do it over Zoom” decision is a modern solution representative of the times. Though we no longer have to do things over Zoom like in 2020, when this first happened to Biden and Harris, it’s a convenient compromise that still occurs shockingly often in America four years later."

    "article_content": "Jurors found Donald Trump guilty on 34 counts in the former President’s hush money trial in New York on Thursday, according to The New York Times . He is the first American president to become a felon. The 12 Manhattan residents who sit on the jury reached a verdict after their second day of deliberations. “This was a disgrace. This was a rigged trial by a conflicted judge who was corrupt,” said Trump on national television following the verdict. “The real verdict is gonna by Nov. 5th by the people, and they know what happened here and everyone knows what happened here.” Trump was charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records surrounding reimbursements for a “hush money” payment his attorney Michael Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. The prosecution alleged Trump attempted to cover up the payments by disguising the purpose of these reimbursements. After his conviction, Trump was reportedly unresponsive, sitting slack at the defense table. “In New York today, we saw that no one is above the law,” said the Biden-Harris 2024 campaign in a statement. “Donald Trump has always mistakenly believed he would never face consequences for breaking the law for his own personal gain. But today’s verdict does not change the fact that the American people face a simple reality. There is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box. Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president.” Judge Juan Merchan who presided over the case will be the one to determine what kind of punishment Trump will receive from these 34 guilty counts. The sentencing date is set for July 11 at 10 a.m. in New York. Trump’s lawyer Todd Blanche moved for a judgement of acquittal following the verdict. Trump sent out a Truth Social post shortly before the verdict was reached, saying his “civil rights have been totally violated with this highly political, unconstitutional and election interfering witch hunt.” Truth Social is America's \"Big Tent\" social media platform that encourages an open, free, and… After the verdict, Trump turned back to Truth Social to immediately start fundraising. He posted a campaign video and several links to his website in the hour following his conviction, which asks for donations to his campaign. He also posted, “VICTORY ON NOVEMBER 5TH. SAVE AMERICA!!!” The jurors asked to rehear testimony from two witnesses in the case on Wednesday, Cohen and David Pecker, the CEO of American Media Inc. which owns the National Enquirer, according to CBS News . Prosecutors alleged that these two engaged in a “catch and kill” scheme with the former President to bury negative stories about Trump. During Pecker’s testimony, he described a series of phone calls he had with Trump and Cohen in 2015 surrounding a former Playboy model who said she had sex with Trump. The model, Karen McDougal, was trying to sell her story at the time. Cohen ultimately asked Pecker to buy the life rights to this story, implying the Trump organization would pay him back for it if they buried it. Stock in Trump Media sank 15% in after hours trading when the former President was delivered his conviction. The stock recovered slightly, now just down 8% on the day as of 5:35 pm. Mind you, this is one of four criminal cases Trump is involved in at the moment. The others are the classified documents case, the Georgia election interference case, and the federal election interference case. We’ll have to wait and see how the rest plays out."

    "article_content": "Defying “persistent requests” from Russian media regulator Roskomnadzor, Mozilla said this week that it will restore local access to five censorship-circumventing add-ons. Mozilla pulled the Firefox extensions—including Censor Tracker and Runet Censorship Bypass —in Russia earlier this month without directly notifying their developers, the Register first reported. Citing “recent regulatory changes in Russia,” Mozilla told Russian news outlet Kommersant on June 6 that its decision to delist the extensions was temporary. At the time, the firm said it was “carefully considering the next steps, taking into account our local community,” per an auto-translation of the story. By “regulatory changes,” Mozilla seemed to reference Russia’s March 1 ban of websites and ads that offer info on virtual private networks, or VPNs. The affected extensions offer access to websites blocked in Russia, including Tor sites and “libraries, encyclopedias, oppositional political sites.” At least two of the extensions are open-source and simultaneously accessible on the Microsoft-owned code repository Github. Mozilla didn’t immediately respond to a Gizmodo request for comment on its latest decision. Yet, in a belated response to irate comments on its support forum , where users questioned the company’s open-internet pledge , community- and developer-relations manager Edward Sullivan said Mozilla will reinstate access to the extensions. “We remain committed to supporting our users in Russia and worldwide and will continue to advocate for an open and accessible internet for all,” a statement posted by Sullivan on Thursday reads. “Users should be free to customize and enhance their online experience through add-ons without undue restrictions,” it adds. Along with Tor, Russia has censored access to a wide range of popular sites and services, including PornHub , Telegram , Shutterstock , certain Facebook pages , and Google News ."

    "article_content": "NBCUniversal’s Peacock will raise its prices by $2 this summer, according to The Hollywood Reporter on Monday. The price change is slated to go into effect on July 18 for new customers, just a week before the opening ceremony of the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics. If you’re just looking to stream the Olympics, Peacock will have the most coverage , and you can plan it out to save a couple of bucks. For new customers on July 18, Peacock Premium will rise in price from $5.99 to $7.99 a month, while Premium Plus will rise from $11.99 to $13.99. For existing subscribers, the price change won’t go into effect until August 17th. It’s the latest price bump in an unfortunate string of streaming price hikes . However, if you’re just looking to stream the Summer Olympics, there’s a small window when you can still stream the event at the original $5.99 price. If you purchase Peacock Premium between July 12 and July 17, you can still stream the entire Olympic games at the original $5.99 price. Just remember to cancel the subscription after the closing ceremony. The Paris 2024 Summer Olympics will occur from July 26 to Aug. 11, ending just before the price hike goes into effect. Purchasing the streaming service before July 12 means you have to pay for more than one month while purchasing after July 17 will lock you in at the $7.99 price. Granted, Peacock Premium has ads, but short of using a VPN to stream the event , $5.99 for two weeks of round-the-clock Olympic coverage isn’t a bad deal. This is especially true when you compare it to alternative streaming options carrying the 2024 Olympics. Hulu + Live TV (With Ads) will show the events, but it’s going to be $76.99 a month. YouTube TV also will have it, but that costs about $72.99 a month. As for casual Peacock subscribers, you’re out of luck. The streaming service is looking to squeeze even more value out of you. Comcast revealed that Peacock added 3 million paid subscribers in the last few months last week during earnings. The company is betting these price hikes won’t scare off customers. We’re likely to see more price hikes throughout 2024, continuing a trend throughout late 2023, among other practices to squeeze subscribers. Max and Disney recently followed Netflix’s playbook by cracking down on password sharing . All the streamers are getting too big essentially, so instead of growing their subscriber base, they’re just trying to make you pay more for the service while they spend less."

    "article_content": "Apple and other streaming companies are interested in shaking up the entertainment industry’s compensation model. Under a newly proposed system (which is really only an idea, at this point), talent—like actors and other production staff—would reportedly be paid based, at least partially, on how well the movie performs on the company’s platform. If a lot of people watch a movie, the creators would get big bonuses. If not, the payment wouldn’t be so hefty. Bloomberg cites an internal memo and conversations with entertainment industry folks to report that Apple has been meeting with talent representatives to pitch them on the new compensation model. This new model would involve bonuses of various sizes, based on a “points system.” Those bonuses would be doled out based on several factors. Bloomberg breaks it down like this: ...the size of the bonuses will be based on three criteria: the number of people who signed up for Apple TV+ to watch, how much time they spent viewing and the cost of the program relative to the size of its audience. People with one of the top three shows could share up to $10.5 million for a season. According to Bloomberg, the idea behind the model is to more intimately wed performance with compensation and, ideally, incentivize better content. Right now, creators can be paid large sums of money before a feature or show is ever even made—a trend that Bloomberg says largely began with Netflix. This model was tied to the initial growth of the streaming industry when platforms were trying to win over big talent and were willing to dole out large amounts of money just to get certain actors, directors, or producers onto their sites. Now, as companies seek to cut back on costs, they’re looking to make more with less. Other companies besides Apple, including Amazon and Netflix, are also considering similar point systems. Compensation from streaming services has been at the heart of recent entertainment industry squabbles. The Hollywood writer’s strike , which temporarily threw the industry into disarray last year, revolved around the controversial compensation arrangements inherent to the streaming industry. Those arrangements, which writers felt had left them in an increasingly precarious economic situation, may have been renegotiated during the strike, but writers are still said to be struggling. While change may be welcome, it’s not at all clear whether streaming companies can be trusted when it comes to the new pay models they’re proposing. These services are known for their lack of transparency and artists are frequently blindsided when a seemingly popular show is suddenly canceled on a whim. Gizmodo reached out to Apple, Netflix, and Amazon for comment but did not receive and immediate response."

    "article_content": "The boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul originally scheduled to stream live on Netflix July 20 has been postponed, according to a tweet from Most Valuable Promotions, which is co-producing the fight. The stated reason for the delay is an ulcer flare-up that Tyson is suffering from. Most Valuable Promotions, owned by Jake Paul and Nakisa Bidarian, announced the delay in a statement by noting that medical professionals had advised Tyson to only do light training over the next few weeks before the boxing legend could return to full training. “Both Mike and Jake are in agreement that it is only fair to ensure that both athletes have equal training time to prepare for this important match and are able to compete at the highest level,” Most Valuable Promotions tweeted on Friday . “The health and well-being of athletes is our top priority, and we fully support Mike in taking the necessary time to allow him to perform at the level he expects.” Previously purchased tickets to the match will be honored for the yet unannounced date of the fight at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Tyson released a statement thanking his fans around the world for their support, explaining that his doctor had advised him he should take it easy. But Tyson also stressed that he was in good shape and didn’t hesitate to talk some trash about Paul. “My body is in better overall shape than it has been since the 1990s and I will be back to my full training schedule soon,” Tyson said in a statement tweeted by Most Valuable Promotions . “Jake Paul, this may have bought you some time, but in the end you will still be knocked out and out of boxing for good. I appreciate everyone’s patience and can’t wait to deliver an unforgettable performance later this year.” News of the delay, first reported by Variety , comes after it was revealed Tyson had some kind of medical emergency on a flight to Los Angeles earlier this week. Representatives for Tyson had originally insisted he would be ready for the July 20 fight. Paul released a statement doing a bit of tough-guy talking himself while expressing his eagerness to finally get in the ring with Tyson. “I fully support postponing the event so Mike Tyson has no excuses come fight night,” Paul said. “My fans know I don’t want to face Iron Mike at anything but his best, but let there be no mistake—when he steps into the ring with me, I will be ready to claim my W with a sensational finish. Paul vs Tyson will be one for the ages, and I promise to bring my best for this once-in-a-lifetime matchup.”"

    "article_content": "Spotify could be getting more expensive, but it’ll actually be for a good reason. A new high-fidelity audio tier will reportedly come out later this year, according to a report from Bloomberg Tuesday. The subscription will cost at least $5 more a month and come with better-sounding music as well as new tools for making playlists and managing music libraries. Spotify didn’t immediately respond to a request for confirmation about this new tier. HiFi audio on Spotify has been rumored for years. Back in 2021, the company said it was working on the feature and it would be out later that year. There was speculation that the premium tier was shelved after Apple Music beat Spotify to the punch . Amazon, Tidal, as well as Apple offer high-quality audio as part of their services. Last year saw more rumblings about this higher-priced tier, dubbed internally as “Supremium.” It was supposed to be released late last year, so we’ll see if three times is the charm for audiophiles who subscribe to Spotify. Streaming high-fidelity audio has been a big deal for music lovers. Legendary rocker Neil Young constantly took issue with Spotify for its streaming quality. Young removed his music from Spotify in 2022 over its promotion of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast when the comedian was inviting guests who share covid-19 and vaccine misinformation. The rocker changed his mind back in March but pleaded with the music streaming company to do something to bring high-fidelity audio to subscribers. “I have returned to Spotify, in sincere hopes that Spotify sound quality will improve and people will be able to hear and feel all the music as we made it,” Young said in March."

    "article_content": "In March, a software bug threatened to derail large swaths of the web. XZ utils , an open-source compression tool embedded in myriad software products and operating systems, was found to have been implanted with a backdoor. The backdoor—a surreptitious entry point into the software—would have allowed a person with the requisite code to hijack the machines running it and issue commands as an administrator. Had the backdoor been widely distributed, it would have been a potential disaster for millions of people. Luckily, before the malicious update could be pushed out into wider circulation, a software engineer from Microsoft noticed irregularities in the code and reported it. The project was subsequently commandeered by responsible parties and has since been fixed. While disaster was narrowly averted, the episode has highlighted the ongoing liabilities in the open-source development model that are longstanding and not easily fixed. The XZ episode is far from the first time an open-source bug has threatened to derail large swaths of the web. It certainly won’t be the last. Understanding the vexing cybersecurity dilemmas posed by open-source software requires a tour through its byzantine and not altogether intuitive ecosystem. Here, for the uninitiated, is our attempt to give you that tour. Today, the vast majority of codebases rely on open-source code. It is estimated that 70 to 90 percent of all software “ stacks ” are composed of it. In all likelihood, the vast majority of the apps on your phone have been designed with it, and, if you are one of the 2.5 billion people in the world who uses an Android, your device’s operating system is a modified version of the software that originated with the Linux kernel —the largest open source project in the world. When people talk about software “ supply chains ”—the digital scaffolding that supports our favorite web products and services—much of that code is made of open-source components. Its ubiquity has led observers to refer to open source as the “ critical infrastructure ” of the internet—a Protean substance that is both indispensable and incredibly powerful. Yet, as important as it is, open-source software remains a subject that isn’t widely understood by most people outside of the tech industry. Most people have never even heard of it. For the uninitiated, a quick explanation might go something like this: Unlike “closed” or proprietary software, free and open source software, or FOSS, is publicly inspectable and can be used or modified by anyone. Its usage is determined by a variety of licensing agreements and, quite uniquely, the components are often maintained by volunteers—unpaid developers who spend their free time keeping the software up to date and in good working condition. Open-source projects can start as pretty much anything. Often, they are small projects for digital tinkerers who simply want to build something new. Eventually, some projects get popular, and private companies will begin incorporating them into their commercial codebases. In many cases, when a corporate development team decides to create a new application, they will construct it using a wealth of smaller, already existing software components which are comprised of hundreds or even thousands of lines of code. These days, most of those components come from the open-source community. It can be sort of difficult to picture how this odd relationship between commercial software and the open source ecosystem works. Luckily, several years ago the webcomic artist Randall Munroe created what is now a well-known meme that helps visualize this counterintuitive dynamic: There are many reasons that companies turn to open source for their development needs. Aside from the fact that it’s free, FOSS also allows for software to be created with efficiency and speed. If a programmer doesn’t have to worry about the fundamental building blocks of an application’s code, it frees them up to focus on the software’s more marketable elements. In a competitive environment like Silicon Valley—where a speedy time to market is a critical advantage—open source is pretty much a DevOps imperative. But with speed and agility comes vulnerability. If FOSS is a ubiquitous element of modern software, there are also structural problems with the ecosystem that put massive amounts of software at risk. Those problems can get pretty hairy pretty quickly—often with disastrous results. The XZ episode didn’t end in disaster, but it easily could have. One instance where web users weren’t so lucky was the notorious “log4shell” incident. Three years ago, in November 0f 2021, a code vulnerability was discovered in the then-popular open-source program log4j. A logging library , programs like log4j are regularly integrated into apps, where coders use them to record and assess a program’s internal processes. Log4j, which is maintained by the open-source organization Apache , was widely used at the time of the bug’s discovery and was embedded in millions of applications all over the world. Unfortunately, log4j’s bug—dubbed “ log4shell ”—was quite bad . Like the XZ bug, it involved remote code execution. This meant that a hacker could quite easily inject their own “arbitrary” code into an impacted program, enabling them to hijack the machine running it. Due to log4j’s popularity, the scope of the bug was massive. Major, multi-billion dollar companies were affected. Hundreds of millions of devices were vulnerable. In the days after the flaw’s disclosure, experts estimated that the vulnerabilities were a ticking time bomb and that cybercriminals were already looking to exploit them. The discovery of the bug sent corporate America into a full-blown panic and spooked the highest levels of the federal government. Some of the biggest companies in the world were at risk —making it a matter of national security. Several weeks after the bug’s discovery, Anne Neuberger, a top cybersecurity advisor to President Joe Biden, called a White House summit on open source security, inviting executives from Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon, IBM, and other big names, as well as influential open source organizations like Apache, the Linux Foundation, and Linux’s Open Source Security Foundation, or OSSF. The meeting was less concerned with how to remedy the hellish vulnerability than with figuring out how to stop this sort of thing from ever happening again. Not long after the meeting, top executives at the Linux Foundation, including then-general manager of OSSF Brian Behlendorf, began formulating a so-called “mobilization plan” to better secure the entire FOSS ecosystem. The federal government, meanwhile, began developing its own strategies to further regulate the tech industry. Most notably, President Biden’s cybersecurity plan , which was published last year, has sought to prioritize a number of new safeguards to prevent the emergence of new, highly destructive bugs. Yet as the dangers surrounding the XZ vulnerability show, FOSS is still an environment that, at its highest levels, is vulnerable to bugs that could have catastrophic, system-wide implications for the internet. Understanding the risks in FOSS, however, isn’t easy. It requires a detour into the unique ecosystem that produces so much of the world’s software. Before we go any further, it’d be helpful to make one thing clear: Just because a software program is “closed source” or proprietary doesn’t mean it’s more secure. Indeed, security experts and FOSS proponents contend that the opposite is true. We’ll revisit this issue again later but, for the time being, I’ll just direct your attention to a little company called Microsoft. This company, despite being a prominent, closed-source corporate giant, has had its product base hacked countless times —sometimes to disastrous effect. Many companies that keep their products closed have similar track records, and, unlike with open-source software, their security issues are often kept secret, since nobody but the company has access to the code. If you want to talk about the security risks in open-source software, you have to start by talking about the people behind the code. In the open-source ecosystem, those people are known as “ maintainers ” and, as you might expect, they are in charge of maintaining the quality of the software. Explaining the role of the maintainer is a little complicated. Maintainers might aptly be compared to the construction workers who—in the real world—build our roads and bridges. Or, the engineers who design them. Or both. In short, a maintainer is the caretaker (and often the creator) of a particular open-source project but, in many cases, they work together with “contributors”—users of the software who want to make improvements to the code. Maintainers host their open-source projects on public repositories, the most popular of which is Github . These repositories include interactive mechanisms that are ultimately controlled by the maintainer. For instance, when a contributor wants to add something to a project, they might submit a “ pull request ” on GitHub, which includes the new code they hope to add. The maintainer is then tasked with signing off on a “merge,” which will update the project to reflect the contributor’s changes. It’s through this collaborative process that open-source projects continually grow and transform. As the master controller of these living, iterative projects, the maintainer’s job often requires an immense amount of work—everything from ongoing correspondence with users and contributors, to signing off on code commits, to creating “ documentation ” guides that show how everything inside the software actually works. Yet, for all of that work, a whole lot of maintainers are not paid particularly well. Most are not paid at all . Open source is supposed to be free, remember? In the world of FOSS, hard work is repaid with little more than the knowledge that your code is being put to good use. The plight of the maintainer is a peculiar one and is very much tied up with open source’s complicated history, as well as its not altogether straightforward relationship with the corporations that use its code. It’s helpful to consider that, in the beginning, open source didn’t have much to do with corporatism or money. In fact, it was just the opposite. FOSS grew out of an idealistic hacker movement from the 1980s called the “free software” movement . For all intents and purposes, that movement began with Richard Stallman—an eccentric computer scientist who looks a little like Jerry Garcia and has long espoused a bold form of cybernetic idealism. In 1983, while working at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, Stallman established GNU , a repository of free software. The idea behind the collection was user control. Stallman balked at the idea that private companies could keep software behind a walled garden. He felt that software users needed the ability to control the programs they used—to see how they worked, as well as to change or modify them if they wished. As such, Stallman postulated the idea of “free” software—famously commenting that he meant free “like free speech, not like free beer.” That is to say, Stallman is not against developers getting paid, but their code should be open and visible to all for future improvement. In 1991, a then-21-year-old Finnish computer programming student named Linus Torvalds spurred the next great innovation in open-source history. Reportedly out of boredom , Torvalds created a new operating system and named it after himself, calling it “Linux.” Pivotally, Torvalds created the Linux “kernel,” the vital component within any operating system that governs the interface between a computer’s hardware and its digital processes. It wasn’t clear at the time, but Linux would go on to become the largest, most popular open-source project in the world . Today, there are hundreds of Linux distributions (or “distros”) that use the kernel that Torvalds created. In 1998, a small but influential group inside the free software community decided they wanted to break away from the movement’s idealistic roots and take the software mainstream. A summit was held in Mountain View, Calif., where participants sought to discuss how to “re-brand” free software into something “the corporate world would hasten to buy,” writes Eric Raymond, a well-known programmer, and one of the meeting’s attendees. “Open source” was pitched as a “marketing term,” invented with the purpose of capturing the imaginations of America’s tech titans and steering them away from the vaguer, more Communist-adjacent terminology of “free,” Raymond explains. The hope was that businessmen would forget Stallman’s hippy-dippy stuff and buy into the more pragmatic-sounding term. It turns out that they did buy it. It was the Dot Com bubble , Silicon Valley was booming, and private enterprise was hungry for new ways to unleash profits. To many businesses, open source—which presented a shared pool of free labor and an industrial model for innovation— seemed like a good idea . The “open source” movement thus largely splintered from the “free” movement, becoming its own, corporately-propelled organism, which, in time, took over a greater and greater space inside the software industry. Linux became ubiquitous , Torvalds became famous , and Stallman largely continued to do what he’d always done: advocate for his digital freedoms and disparage the corporate software giants. Today, the world runs on “open source,” though it’s still a term Stallman categorically rejects . He still prefers the term “free” software. Open-source software has become a ubiquitous resource for corporations, but the developers who are responsible for creating and maintaining that vital material haven’t always seen the support—financial or otherwise—that they deserve. Indeed, many companies are often content to grab the code and scat, essentially exploiting the free work without giving back to the projects or their creators. For the last few years, the company Tidelift has published a survey based on interviews with hundreds of open-source maintainers. Each year, the survey shows pretty much the same thing: Maintainers are overworked, underappreciated, and burned out. More than half of open source maintainers are not paid at all for their work, the survey results have shown. A 2020 Linux Foundation survey of contributors similarly found that more than half of respondents—or approximately 51.65 percent—said they were unpaid. Maintainer burnout has been blamed for the XZ incident . Indeed, the original maintainer of the software project reported feeling “behind” on it and eventually ceded responsibility to a user named “Jia Tan.” This user ended up being the person who introduced the backdoor into the software component. There have long been calls for the private sector to do more to support the FOSS ecosystem but, for the most part, those calls have fallen on deaf ears. It’s true that, in recent years, large tech corporations have poured money into certain sectors of the open-source ecosystem—but often only in places where it’s advantageous for them to do so. For the vast majority of FOSS coders, maintaining projects still comes with little to no compensation, and it’s often less of a fun hobby or a real job than a thankless hustle—think the creator economy with code. On Reddit, you can find thread after thread where developers discuss ways to bootstrap FOSS financing. Some suggest turning to Liberapay, an open-source crowdfunding platform known for doling out money to cash-stressed devs. Others think Patreon is a good option . At least one person encourages people to reach out to Gitcoin, a Web3 startup that uses cryptocurrency grants to sponsor FOSS projects. A lot of developers just incorporate donation portals on their Github project pages—with links to stuff like Stripe, PayPal, or Buy Me a Coffee. As with most creative endeavors, begging for money ends up being the surest way to make a buck. You can probably imagine the security issues that can arise from having an immensely popular piece of software maintained via OnlyFans-type contributions. Studies have shown that the vast majority of commercial apps contain open-source components that are no longer updated or have been abandoned by their maintainers. The dangers inherent in building enterprise digital infrastructure off the backs of a decentralized, sometimes flighty labor pool are readily apparent if you know the story of Heartbleed. Discovered in 2014, the Heartbleed bug was a critical vulnerability in OpenSSL , an open-source encryption protocol that, at the time, was responsible for powering much of the secure communications programming across the web. Large companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix, and Yahoo used it, as did a vast assortment of other applications and services, from VPNs to instant messaging and email platforms. Naturally, the discovery of the bug, which allowed an attacker to trick vulnerable servers into handing over sensitive data like usernames and passwords, commenced outright panic throughout much of the internet. “We found out that a thing that everybody used was being supported by just a couple people who weren’t really being paid for it at all,” said Jon Callas, a cryptography expert and software engineer, recalling the chaos that erupted at the time. Callas didn’t work on the OpenSSL team, but he knew the people who did, and he worked on a similar project at the time. As Callas alludes to, the problem with OpenSSL seemed to inevitably come back to the maintainers. Indeed, it would come out that OpenSSL, responsible for securing privacy and security services for droves of major blue chip companies, was actually maintained by a small, 11-person team, the likes of which included a “core” team of four people and only one full-time employee. “It is a real problem,” Callas said, of the open source’s maintenance issues. Callas has some experience with this, having been one of the key architects behind OpenPGP , an open standard of PGP encryption used widely throughout the internet. “Figuring out how software packages—which are basically [digital] infrastructure—get supported and maintained is a huge issue.” Heartbleed exposed a real problem with what had been the operating paradigm for open-source security until that time. For years, the FOSS world was guided by a doctrine that said open-source software was more secure than commercial software. The reasoning goes that FOSS’s transparency, with its code open to the entire web, allowed for greater visibility into its flaws—and thus, greater opportunity to fix those flaws. This is what is known as the “more eyes” argument . So the thinking went, commercial software only had one development team to look out for bugs; open source had the entire internet. There is an elegant logic to this argument but it also has shortcomings. The “more eyes” argument works in an ideal world—one where FOSS projects get everything they need. Of course, in the real world, open source is only as secure as the resources and people allocated to maintaining it. More often than not, FOSS projects have fewer eyes than they need, not more. Or, maybe they might have the wrong eyes looking at them—like those of a cybercriminal. It’s undeniable that a certain amount of FOSS projects are incredibly secure. The Linux kernel is said to have been pored over by some 14,000 different contributors since 2005. The Linux Foundation employs around 150 people and brought in an estimated $262.6 million in revenues last year, a majority of which came from corporate and private contributions. In many ways, it’s because of that support and transparency that onlookers were able to catch Jia Tan, the apparent progenitor of the XZ vulnerability. But the problem with using Linux as an exemplar of open-source security is pretty obvious: Most open-source projects are not Linux and they do not get Linux-level support. When Heartbleed happened, it was considered a “ wake-up call ” for the software community. The incident fundamentally pivoted corporate America’s attention to the security issues surrounding open source for the first time. It also compelled the Linux Foundation to create the Core Infrastructure Initiative , which sought to identify open-source projects of vital importance that needed additional support (it was replaced by the OSSF in October of 2021). Yet if Heartbleed was a canary in the digital coal mine, it ultimately wasn’t one that everybody heeded. Indeed, the threat landscape since 2014 has only gotten more complex, as FOSS has become a larger and more integral part of the web. Today, the problems aren’t limited to the occasional catastrophic bug. Indeed, they’re a whole lot more complicated than that. In our modern world, commercial software is everywhere. Our lives are more digital and interconnected than ever before and pretty much everything you own—from your vacuum to your exercise equipment to your toothbrush—comes with an app. As a result, the opportunity for the software running all of those apps to be compromised has expanded greatly. Today, so-called software “supply chain attacks” are relatively common . Such attacks take aim at particularly weak software components, sometimes allowing cybercriminals to exploit one weak piece to take over or corrupt an entire product or system. More often than not, the components that allow initial access into supply chains are FOSS . There are so many ways to hack open-source components within supply chains that the catalog of vulnerabilities was nicknamed the “backstabber’s knife collection” in one notable article from 2020. One person who knows this complex threat landscape well is Dan Lorenc. A seasoned security professional with a background in FOSS, Lorenc spent nearly a decade working at Google, and at least three years working cybersecurity detail for Google Cloud. Lorenc now owns the supply chain security business Chainguard, which handles many of the same issues that cropped up during his stint with Google. “I think open source faces some unique challenges, mostly just because of the decentralized nature [of its development]. You can’t necessarily trust everybody writing the code,” said Lorenc. “Anybody on the internet can contribute to open source code but not everybody on the internet is a nice person.” Yes, the unfortunate truth is that the XZ episode is far from the first time that a FOSS maintainer or contributor has introduced malicious software into a project. A 2020 report found that while most bugs in FOSS are simply coding errors, approximately 17 percent—or about a fifth—were maliciously introduced bugs, or what researchers called “bugdoors.” One notorious example of this occurred in 2018, when the developer of a popular open-source program called event-stream was tired of maintaining the project and decided to cede control to another developer—a pseudonymous web user named “Right9ctrl.” The only problem was that “Right9ctrl” turned out to be a cybercriminal, who subsequently introduced a malicious update into the software. The update enabled the criminal to hack into a certain brand of cryptocurrency wallets and steal their funds. The malicious code, downloaded some 8 million times, went unnoticed for approximately two months. The trend of FOSS developers sabotaging their own projects has also been trending upward. In October of 2021, the maintainer of a popular set of npm libraries, a man named Marak Squires, inexplicably destroyed them with a series of bizarre updates. The updates caused the software to regurgitate a stream of incoherent gibberish that effectively ruined whatever project was running the software. It is estimated that this act of digital self-immolation led to the destruction of “thousands” of software projects that relied upon coding libraries for success. Lorenc also says that there are definitely more “log4js” out there—critical projects that just aren’t getting the attention or maintenance they deserve. Actually, this sort of situation pops up “all the time,” he said. In cases where such projects blow up in corporate users’ faces, the blame often gets placed on the maintainers. People insinuate that “they’re not doing their jobs professionally, [or] not spending enough time on it,” Lorenc said. “But, really, it’s a complicated problem. They [the maintainers] put something out there for free and then people will start building a gigantic piece of critical production infrastructure on top of it and complain later when bugs are found.” So, what to do? How do you regulate a technological space that is—by its very nature—deeply decentralized, plagued by anonymity, and structurally resistant to any meddling by an overarching authority? That question has been keeping a lot of people up at night. At various times since the log4j debacle, I have reached out to executives at OpenSSF, Linux’s security subsidiary, to discuss progress on its “mobilization plan,” which, if you’ll recall, was put together to create new safeguards for the FOSS environment after the log4shell bug was discovered. When initially proposed, the plan had a lot of moving parts to it and it wasn’t exactly clear which ones would take priority. In 2022, I spoke with the managing director of OpenSSF Brian Behlendorf, who told me that there are at least a couple of proposals within the mobilization plan that are primed for action—ones he called “shovel ready.” One of the most promising solutions is also the most obvious: forcing companies to inventory the code they use. Weird as it may sound, a lot of companies don’t do that. The OSSF has stated that firms often “have no inventory of the software assets they deploy, and often have no data about the components within the software they have acquired.” Not super appealing, right? It’s a little like a construction company building a skyscraper but having no idea what the foundation is made of. Would you want to live or work in a building like that? The mobilization plan called for the widespread adoption of third-party code audits, known in the business as a “software bill of materials,” or SBOM. Such tools provide an inventory of a particular piece of software, collected via algorithm. By telling a user what’s inside their own program, SBOMs allow software providers to check whether those individual components are affected by security risks or not. “The best way to think of it is as an ingredient list on the side of a package of food,” said Tim Mackey, who works with security firm Synopsys, one of several companies that offer SBOM services. “The software bill of materials is all about telling you what’s in there and where it came from.” SBOMs have been around for years, but they have mostly been used to weed out legal risks . Because FOSS usage is girded upon a convoluted variety of licensing agreements, companies have often used SBOMs to determine a codebase’s contents and, therefore, what legal agreements need to be abided by to avoid getting sued . Now, however, they’re seeing adoption to mitigate an entirely different kind of risk. In May of 2021, the Biden administration issued an executive order that, among other things, mandated that all software contractors that work with the federal government use SBOMs. Mackey said that, since the order went through, his industry has seen an explosion of interest. “It’s been an incredible boost in business,” he said. “Fantastic growth.” But even if SBOMs are a step in the right direction, they aren’t ultimately a structural solution to the larger security issues posed by FOSS. In fact, they don’t do anything to mitigate risks that exist in code. “Really, they’re just sort of accurate asset inventory,” said former Google dev Dan Lorenc, noting that it’s “crazy” that a majority of companies don’t already have that. “They [SBOMs] don’t fix the bugs, they don’t prevent bugs, they don’t stop attackers from tampering with stuff. They just give you a good baseline.” Cory Doctorow, a longtime member of the open-source community, says there are currently no incentives for companies to build secure software. When supply chain attacks happen, open-source maintainers get blamed, but the companies using the code are really the ones at fault. “We are in this zone where, not only do companies not have any affirmative duty to make sure that their software is good and that their maintainers feel supported, but volunteers who line up to warn” those companies and their customers “about defects” can be “silenced by a company if they feel that you’re damaging their public image.” Indeed, Doctorow says that it isn’t uncommon for tech companies to sue security researchers who try to reveal bugs in their products. The total lack of action by companies leaves much of the hard work of software security up to individual maintainers and open-source organizations like the Linux Foundation. To their credit, those organizations have been working hard to come up with new solutions to the security issues posed by FOSS. In addition to encouraging SBOM adoption, the OpenSSF has pursued a number of other security initiatives over the past several years. Those programs include developing free security applications, like GUAC —a free software-tracking mechanism that allows coders to hunt for problematic components in their code—and Sigstore , a cryptographic signature for verifying the validity of a developer’s software. If these efforts sound promising, it’s critical to note that they are taking place against the backdrop of rising supply chain attacks , ongoing maintainer burnout, and a general feeling that the security posture of the open source environment has not changed much since the days of log4j. Some have argued that nothing short of a system-wide overhaul will secure the Internet. Matthew Hodgson, the co-founder of the encrypted protocol Matrix, recently argued that FOSS should be a publicly funded service, one that—much like America’s real, physical infrastructure—receives ongoing federal funding and support. Of course, the likelihood that such a drastic transformation will actually happen seems marginal, which leaves those who maintain the open-source ecosystem with a Sisyphean task. Since last summer, Brian Behlendorf has moved on to another position within the Linux Foundation, passing the security torch to former Google Cloud engineer Omkhar Arasaratnam, who now serves as general manager of OpenSSF. Arasaratnam describes his job as “securing the internet,” a task he admits is “incredibly difficult.” A better descriptor might be “impossible.” Still, he admits that while there are no silver bullets, he can’t help but be hopeful because of what’s at stake. “If we get this right, we help 8 billion people,” he says."

    "article_content": "Congress reauthorized America’s warrantless wiretapping program last month after some successful fearmongering by national security hawks on Capitol Hill. But an internal FBI email, leaked to Wired on Wednesday, may accidentally reveal how the federal law enforcement agency plans to overstep the spirit of the law, while technically maintaining the letter of the law. The controversial spying program is Section 702 in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and allows the interception of foreign communications that sometimes include American citizens. The program ostensibly includes safeguards to ensure the law isn’t being used to unnecessarily spy on Americans, but it’s pretty clear from this new email that the FBI likes being able to get communications from Americans. The email obtained by Wired dated April 20 was written by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate and sent out to employees internally. “To continue to demonstrate why tools like this are essential to our mission, we need to use them, while also holding ourselves accountable for doing so properly and in compliance with legal requirements,” the email reads, according to Wired, which notes that the italicization on the word “use” was in the original email. The FBI email made things even more explicit by encouraging searches for Americans when looking through intercepted communications. “I urge everyone to continue to look for ways to appropriately use US person queries to advance the mission, with the added confidence that this new pre-approval requirement will help ensure that those queries are fully compliant with the law,” the email reads. The FBI’s response to Wired is particularly interesting, making it worth quoting at length. From Wired: Following publication, FBI spokesperson Susan McKee provided a statement from the bureau that mischaracterized WIRED’s reporting, inaccurately claiming it “alleged that that the FBI instructed its employees to violate the law or FBI policies.” The statement added that Abbate’s email “emphasized Congress’ recognition of the vital importance of FISA Section 702 to protect the American people and was sent to ensure that FBI personnel were immediately aware of, and in compliance with, the privacy enhancing changes the law has put in place.” Obviously, the FBI is going to say everyone at the agency follows the law since they quite literally are the law. But Wired spoke with Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California who notes this newly leaked email “directly contradicts earlier assertions” by the FBI when the agency was trying to get the law reauthorized. It’s all a mess. The FBI got exactly what it wanted with the reauthorization of Section 702, something that was never really in doubt, even with pressure from a handful of politicians who opposed it. To paraphrase former president Richard Nixon, it’s not illegal when the FBI does it. But what are you going to do in such a ridiculously rigged system ?"

    "article_content": "They’re small, they’re convenient, and, according to security researchers, they’re extremely hackable. The car key fob doesn’t exactly have the greatest reputation when it comes to digital security. Over the past few years, law enforcement agencies have alleged an uptick in the number of car thefts tied to hacking schemes and, more often than not, the key fob is the weak link that allows this to happen. But how, exactly, did the key fob end up being such a vulnerability? Here’s a quick rundown on why your car’s remote entry system is so damn hackable, and whether there’s anything you can do about it. Back in the day, car doors were like normal doors—you could only open them with a specific key. Then, in the 1990s, the key fob emerged. Suddenly, you could conveniently aim a piece of plastic at your car, press a button, and presto, the vehicle was unlocked. This seemingly magic process was accomplished via a short-range radio transmitter integrated into the key fob. The fob sends a signal to a receiver inside the vehicle that disarms the car’s lock system. Key fobs are part of what is technically known as the vehicle’s remote keyless system, or RKS . Different key fobs in different countries can operate at different radio frequencies. In America, pretty much all key fobs operate at a frequency of 315 MHz , though there are minor variations. If opening your car via the magic of electromagnetic waves may be convenient, it comes with a certain amount of insecurity too. Radio signals can be intercepted if they’re not protected. Initially, when key fobs were first invented, their signals had few protections but, in recent years, car manufacturers have endeavored to provide cryptographic defenses for the device. The problem is that these defenses are not necessarily ironclad. There are ways to trick them. Most modern car encryption is really just a “rolling code” system that deploys an algorithm-generated pseudo-random code within a preset range. Hackers have found ways around these protections, using creative methods and hardware to capture the necessary codes and redeploy them against cars. The scenarios in which a person could reliably hack their way into a car via a key fob compromise are...convoluted, to say the least. Indeed, while it might seem outwardly easy to intercept radio signals, the actual execution of that kind of digital attack is anything but simple. As one hapless amateur discovered when he tried to hack a car for his YouTube show , defeating a rolling code system takes a substantial effort that requires expertise and patience. Bill Budington, an encryption expert and a technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that it all depends on the type of car you’re dealing with and the kind of attack. “I haven’t heard of a lot of instances where a car was stolen outright, but it’s not out of the question,” Budington told Gizmodo. “It really just depends on the model of car and how hackable it is,” he added. The easiest attacks involve fobs that were designed without a pseudo-randomized code system. These fobs just use the same code over and over again, which means that all an attacker has to do is capture the code, duplicate it, then re-deploy it. This is a classic Man-in-the-Middle attack, known technically as a “replay attack.” Cheap, off-the-shelf products are available online that allow for this kind of interception-and-duplication hacking scheme. “They weren’t building cars with advanced attack scenarios in mind when they were building them fifteen or twenty years ago,” Budington said. The more complicated attack is known as the “relay attack.” This attack takes aim at the admittedly more secure rolling code security system in the modern car’s RKS. When it comes to the execution of the relay attack, however, there are a number of different variations. Back in 2015, white hat hacker Samy Kamkar famously created what he calls the “RollJam attack,” which works by using a simple, $32 piece of hardware to intercept and then block a key fob’s signal to its vehicle. By doing this, Kamkar demonstrated that a hacker could nab a code that could then be redeployed in a later iteration of the car’s rolling security code sequence. In this scenario, a hacker intercepts, blocks, and records the driver’s first two unlock attempts via jamming. After the hacker has the first two codes, they quickly deploy the first code, which unlocks the vehicle for the driver. The driver then gets in the vehicle and proceeds to their destination. The hacker can then follow the driver to their destination and, with the second sequenced code that they previously captured, unlock the car when the driver leaves. At the time of his debut of RollJam at that year’s DEFCON conference, Kamkar said he had successfully tested his attack on “Nissan, Cadillac, Ford, Toyota, Lotus, Volkswagen, and Chrysler vehicles, as well as Cobra and Viper alarm systems and Genie and Liftmaster garage door openers.” Kamkar’s attack was later built upon via the “Rollback” attack , which debuted at one of 2022's Blackhat conferences. Rollback streamlined certain parts of the exploit. A very similar exploit to RollJam/Rollback, the Rolling-PWN attack , was also publicized the same year. Researchers said that Rolling-PWN allowed “anyone to permanently open the car door or even start the car engine” of nearly half a dozen Honda models. In short: For hackers with the requisite know-how, breaking the RKS rolling code system is not a problem. Unfortunately, there’s not much you can do about this. Car cybersecurity sucks and until manufacturers decide that they care about these vulnerabilities, they will persist. If you’re plagued by paranoid dreams of rogue hackers stealing your ride, you might try keeping your key fob inside a Faraday Cage. There are, in fact, many such products available on Amazon . But, again, this is of limited use. A cage could protect your fob from hackers who are trying to collect signals while your fob is at rest in your house or even your pocket (yes, this is another thing that can happen ). Of course, the unfortunate truth is that if you go this route you’ll likely have to keep the fob in the cage all of the time—except when you’re using it. And it won’t keep your fob safe when you’re actually unlocking your car, which is when a RollJam type attack would occur. Frankly, people might also think you’re sort of weird if you insist on carrying your key fob around in a tinfoil-encased pouch all the time. They’ll definitely think you’re weird, in fact. Maybe it’s a small price to pay if you’re convinced people are out to steal your car, though. The choice is yours."

    "article_content": "Imagine yourself as a single cap on a keyboard. Perhaps you’re an oft-used letter like “A” or instead the lonely, remote “~” key. If you’re one of the former, you wince every time that giant hand looms over you, the hammer falling with inexorable speed toward your head. You depress, then spring back, waiting again for the next stroke to fall. Or perhaps in this A Toy Story- like fever dream you wish to be pressed, but you sit far away from the regular keys, and you simply yearn to be pressed, hoping desperately the user will accidentally smash the “Scroll Lock” key. So, okay, that was weird. But you know what, if you really want to feel like a key cap, that option is available to you thanks to the folks at Gboard. The Gboard Caps project is exactly what it sounds like. The Google Japan team created a key cap… cap. Not only that, but the hat design can type out different characters based on the direction and position of your head when you press it. And before you ask, yes, the developers said it actually works. The team claimed their cap is both “portable” and “fashionable,” and we’d be hard-pressed to disagree. If you want to see how swanky you’d be adorned with a Google Cap, the Japan team has a page that uses your webcam to virtually try it on . Tilting your head in different directions changes the characters, letting you type out full sentences, should you want to write the next great novel using your noggin in either English characters or Japanese Hiragana. “I want to carry around a keyboard that fits my hand, but my hands are full and I can’t,” reads the Gboard Japan blog. “We developed it with not only portability in mind but also functionality and form.” According to the group, users can rotate their heads from side to side, which will then dictate a different keystroke according to the angle. Oh, and yes there’s a “caps lock” module that keeps the key from falling off your head. The entire design is available on Github , though you’ll need to source all the materials yourself. If you happen to read Japanese, Google has a design document you can use to make one out of cardboard. The team said they were considering future designs such as “a reversible red and white version, a version with a built-in display, a version with a smartphone case, and a solar-powered version.” To be completely honest, it wouldn’t take long to convince me to wear one with an attached display. Gboard, which was first introduced as a virtual keyboard for Android and iOS back in 2016, has celebrated Oct. 1 (as in 10/1, since the traditional 101-key keyboard is easily the most popular layout ever created ) over the last few years with a weird keyboard design. Last year’s rendition was the extra long stick keyboard where every cap is placed in a row. The stick is 5.25 feet long starting with the traditional “QWERTY.” The Gboard team showed how you could use the stick keyboard as a handy walking stick or find those keys you accidentally kicked under the dresser. Previously, the team also turned a keyboard into a large mug for holding your drink. While that keyboard worked to keep spills off your keyboard, the team’s latest design might be their best one yet, especially for those looking for a mostly hands-free experience."

    "article_content": "Leica, one of the oldest, most venerable camera companies in the world, has debuted a new $9,500 camera that, among other things, is designed to fight the scourge of digital manipulation. The M11-P is specifically marketed to professional photojournalists, and, in addition to producing beautiful images, includes a new watermarking system that Leica says will digitally stamp each image’s metadata with what amounts to a seal of authenticity. One of the biggest problems caused by the generative AI boom is a glut of online disinformation . It has now become so easy to generate fake media content—be it deepfakes, or digitally altered or wholly artificial images—that the world is basically drowning in said material. One of the most prominent solutions that has been discussed as a fix for this problem is watermarking . Watermarking works by automatically inserting identifiable assets into the metadata of an image, which then allows it to be verified as authentic later on. “Determining the authenticity of visual content has become increasingly difficult and important in the age of digital photography,” a statement on Leica’s product announcement reads. “Now with the ability to provide this proof, we are once again strengthening trust in digital content and re-establishing Leica cameras as authoritative tools in the documentation of world events.” Leica says the M11-P produces images stamped with what it calls Content Credentials—a kind of “encrypted metadata in compliance with the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI).” CAI is a recently formed industry group made up of media companies, tech platforms, and NGOs, that says it’s devoted to an open industry standard for “content authenticity and provenance.” The CAI model uses cryptographic asset hashing to insert identifiable signatures into image metadata (i.e., a watermark), allowing for them to be verified as authentic. If CAI-processed images are digitally altered (by Photoshop or some other editing suite), the history of alterations is also recorded by the system. The Credentials can later be verified online by plugging them into an online portal associated with the CAI."

    "article_content": "The mobile class divide between the iPhone blue bubble and the Android green bubble might need regulators to settle things in the future, but Nothing has another solution coming soon. Nothing Chats is an upcoming messaging app for the Nothing Phone (2) that lets Android users drop their green bubbles for the sleek blue bubble from Apple. Developed by Sunbird, the app requires users to log in with their Apple ID or create a new account, and once set, they will be able to send messages on Nothing Chats in roughly the same fashion as in iMessage while using their Android phone. Features such as live typing indicators, full-resolution media sharing and voice notes will be available at launch with read receipts and message reactions coming later, according to a video featuring Nothing CEO Carl Pei uploaded Tuesday. There is a bit of a catch. Nothing Chats requires users to log into their Apple ID accounts onto, essentially, an Apple device via a remote connection. In the Nothing Chats FAQ , messages sent have end-to-end encryption that neither Nothing or Sunbird can access, and login credentials are not stored on Sunbird’s servers. How truly secure this will be once launched is not totally clear. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about Nothing Chats. Nothing Chats launches on the Google Play Store Friday for Nothing Phone (2) owners in the U.S., Canada, UK and EU. The app is still in its beta. The Nothing Phone (2) launched back in July and starts at $599. Pei was the co-founder of OnePlus who started up Nothing in 2021. The Nothing Phones are Android phones with innovative designs that offer a lot of phone for less than the flagship phones from Google, Samsung and Apple."

    "article_content": "Sonos is now experimenting with headphones. In fact, calling it an experiment would be an understatement, considering the company plans to directly compete with Apple and Bose in the headphone market. Rumors started to emerge of a Sonos headset last year after it acquired T2 Software, a Bluetooth audio startup. Sonos’ ambitious plan consists of a number of audio peripherals, but the two most touted products are the aforementioned $400+ pair of headphones and a $150 to $200 TV set-top box (STB). According to a Bloomberg report, the STB will apparently rival Apple and Roku and launch around the end of 2024, while the headphones will most likely be released in April. The company is also looking at putting out new amplifiers and in-ceiling speakers, a higher-end TV soundbar, new subwoofers, an update to the portable Roam speaker, and a business version of its Era 100 speaker. It’s also planning an updated voice control system and a video service. This isn’t the first time Sonos is trying its hand at headphones. It’s been trying to sneak into the headphone market since 2019 and has created a number of product iterations along the way. However, none of those ever saw the light of day, making this release a big deal. There’s not a lot of stuff we know about Sonos’ first-ever headphones yet. We know they’ll feature an over-ear design, compete against the AirPods Max, cost between $400 to $500, offer black and white color variants, sync with Sonos equipment, and offer voice control for navigating between songs. The company will also release an app allowing users to control the headphones from their smartphones. The voice commands the headphones will include will be the same as the ones on its speakers, but the second half of 2024 is going to see a more advanced dubbed Voice 2.0 version. We’ll have to wait to find out what exactly that means."

    "article_content": "How can you tell if a dinosaur is female or male? It’s one of the most basic aspects of biology and yet, for the most part, it continues to be a mystery in paleontology. We don’t yet know the sex of most extinct species, even if those in museum displays have gender-specific names like Sue the T.rex or Cliff the Triceratops . But this past October at the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontologists, one scientist offered insight into the work he and his team are doing to uncover hormones in fossil bones. Their initial results indicate that trace amounts of sex hormones may indeed survive the fossilization process. If so, this could be a game-changer, offering phenomenal insight into ancient animals and their evolution on this planet. Evan Saitta presented that work during an SVP poster session. Currently a postdoctoral paleontologist at the University of Chicago, he’s been pondering the possibility of uncovering fossil hormones since 2018, when he read a number of papers that found cholesterol in fossils, some dating as far back as 720 million years ago . Cholesterol, he noted, is “another type of steroid,” and “sex hormones are biosynthesized from cholesterol.” In other words, the body creates hormones such as estrogen and testosterone by modifying existing cholesterol molecules. Therefore, Saitta explained, “these hormones have a similar basic structure” to cholesterol. That structure is stable, which makes cholesterol more conducive to surviving millions of years of geologic pressure. This led Saitta to wonder if hormones such as estrogen and testosterone might survive as well, even if in an altered form. “Cholesterol is in every cell membrane in your body, whereas these hormones are in much lower concentrations,” he said. “They’re concentrated and produced in the gonads, which don’t fossilize. They travel through the bloodstream, which doesn’t fossilize. And so your hope is that, when an organism dies, there’s enough residual hormone left behind in the bone that you can detect it.” But first, he and his team needed to understand what they were looking for. So they put pure estrogen, in the form of estradiol, a powdered extract, through experiments designed to simulate the fossilization process. These artificial maturation experiments enabled them to imperfectly replicate the heat and pressure that occurs over millions of years. “When you heat up a system,” Saitta said in a phone interview, “the chemical reactions can happen more quickly, and so that’s the sort of trick that you’re going for: You’re using heat to not only directly simulate some of the geothermal heat when [a fossil is] buried underground, but also to account for time.” Estradiol survived the artificial maturation experiment, meaning that, in theory, it might survive fossilization. Putting it through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry—a process that separates molecules out from complex mixtures—gave them a road map: a way to compare potential estrogen “fingerprints” in bones and to understand how and when that fingerprint should appear in that process. Instead of jumping directly to fossils, however, the team tested the bones of extant animals, including a hawk and a goose. They found that same estrogen fingerprint. Saitta went a step further and tested the goose bone surrounded in clay. Would hormones leech out of the bone and into surrounding sediment? In this case, they did not, a finding with implications for future fossil research. With examples from pure estrogen and modern bones, the team moved to fossils. These were not found in formations known for exceptional preservation. They were simply various chunks of bone from different dinosaurs—known and unknown at the time of the experiments. The results were mixed. Four of them suggested trace amounts of estrogen; four had none; and one was uncertain. For Saitta, the potential hormone traces in fossils are not as important as the results from the experiments themselves. “This work is exciting and it’s proof of concept, more than anything else,” he said, because it indicates that hormones might just survive fossilization and they can be detected. “We know estrogen is stable. We know you can detect it in bone beyond just in gonad or blood,” he continued. “And we know that if you pressure cook it, either as a purified extract itself or as residual hormone within bones, you can detect it and you can detect it separate from the surrounding environment. All of that is, I think, the key result.” Jasmina Wiemann, also at the University of Chicago, was not involved in this research. She is a molecular geo-, astro-, paleobiologist and Agouron Institute Fellow at the Field Museum of Natural History. In an email to Gizmodo, she noted that “the authors tackle a question here that has not been rigorously investigated in the past.” But she also wrote that “it can be quite challenging to reliably detect traces of biomolecules that occurred originally in very high concentrations.” She points to heme, “the porphyrin compound that is responsible for the red color of blood: heme is a small and very stable molecule that occurs bound to a protein in the blood of vertebrates. Despite its abundance in vascularized bone of living vertebrates, the detection of traces of heme from fossil bone has proven very challenging and preserved quantities barely exceed detection limits. Sex hormones are distributed through the bloodstream, but occur at roughly one billionth of the concentration of heme.” She added that “trying to extract compounds that are chemically stable, but occur in very low concentrations in fluids that do not leave fossil traces, from adjacent bone matrix, opens up the following question: Given that diagenetic fluids percolate through bone during the fossilization process, what is the chance that a detectable quantity of estrogen traces would survive over millions of years?” Saitta agrees that detecting heme is challenging, but notes that “porphyrins also have an added challenge (which hormones do not): they can also derive from abundant exogenous/environmental sources such as algae in the water in which a body fossil is deposited.” And, he said, in terms of diagenetic fluids–a term that refers to water within sediments and how liquid impacts sediment over time–“this is certainly a hurdle to overcome,” noting that “these molecules are not very soluble in water. We know steroids such as cholesterol can remain in bone without total loss into the matrix over millions of years, so hormones likely should as well.” He points to the quantity of bones he and his colleagues have analyzed (“up to ~50 g in some cases”), stating that “one way to search for low-concentration molecules is to be willing to destroy big chunks of fossil!” But he maintains that “it does appear to be possible to detect estrogen in dried-out bone both before and after maturation,” pointing to the detection of estrogen in the duck and goose bone artificial maturation experiments. Holly Latta is second author on this current work and an organic chemist. She performed the experiments on all of the bones the team has worked on thus far. “Obviously, more work needs to be done to confirm the results and the full extent of what they mean,” she wrote in an email. “But the promise of these results is incredibly exciting.” One might wonder if the absence of estrogen from their results could indicate that the bone tested came from a male. Saitta explained that both females and males contain both estrogen and testosterone; the key to determining one sex over another is in the quantities contained therein. If estrogen can be detected in a fossil at all, he said, that might indicate high levels of estrogen, therefore suggesting a female. Part of their future work will also involve testing for testosterone, along with testing much larger sample sizes and testing fossils from formations that are known for better preservation. “While the question is incredibly exciting,” Wiemann agreed, “there is a lot of fundamental work to be done by both biologists, paleontologists, and geochemists: We first need to know if estrogen indeed can fossilize. And if we are successful in finding traces of estrogen, we need to understand what factors drive differences in the preserved quantities (different depositional settings, different tissues, different taxa, etc.)” But Saitta believes that the question is, “‘Can it be reliably detected at low concentration?’ All the evidence and logic points towards it being able to fossilize.” He conceded that “hormone concentrations are extremely low, but the reasonable expectation is that mass spectrometers will improve over time and detection limits will be lowered. As such, I see only future potential for the study of ancient hormones.” “These hormones,” Saitta said, “they are the driving agents of sexual development and of sexual dimorphism.” That the hormones proved to be stable in their experiments and that trace elements of these hormones might be detected in fossils with little, if any, organics expected to survive, “is all very encouraging. You’re really getting at the direct drivers of sexual development by searching for the hormones themselves.”"

    "article_content": "Into fossils? Taking a road trip across the country and looking for a side quest? Perhaps you’re just looking for an escape from modernity writ large. Well, these are the places for you. More than 320 dinosaur species have been named in the United States and most of the states have produced at least one dinosaur fossil, according to the National Parks Service. But there were also many other ancient denizens on the continent besides dinosaurs, the remains of which are well worth a visit. Without further ado, here are some amazing destinations for fossil spotting. 2 / 13 This site was just made accessible in April 2024, when the U.S. Forest Service acquired 27 acres in Ouray County, Colorado. Two of the acquired parcels contain a fossilized dinosaur trackway of 134 prints covering over 300 feet (91 meters), making it the largest continuous dinosaur trackway in the world, according to the Forest Service. The trackways were made by an individual sauropod over 150 million years ago, according to a USFS release . The trackway is known as the West Gold Hill Dinosaur Track site. 3 / 13 The northeast is not particularly renowned for its fossil beds—the majority of dinosaur fossils are out West. But Dinosaur State Park in the Connecticut Valley is an exception to that rule. Dinosaur State Park houses over 2,600 dinosaur footprints , the majority of which have been reburied to preserve them. But 1/3 of the tracks are exposed, for your viewing pleasure. 4 / 13 The Badlands have been a reservoir for paleontology for well over a century. Members of the Oglala Lakota had been finding fossilized remains well before paleontology was a formal discipline, according to the National Parks Service . The park has yielded thousands of fossil specimens from millions of years of Earth’s history. From the large mammalian brontotheres to the reptilian mosasaurs, which swam in the ancient seas that gave way to the Badlands, there’s plenty to explore. 5 / 13 Known for its Triassic fossils, Petrified Forest National Park is well worth a stop if you’re in Arizona. The world as it existed over 200 million years ago has been frozen in time for your viewing pleasure, in the form of petrified trees and fossilized plants and animals—not to mention the living desert denizens that occupy the landscape today. 6 / 13 The site of Rancho La Brea now sits smack dab in the middle of Los Angeles, but it remains one of the most important fossil sites in the country. Over 100 digs at the site have yielded millions of Pleistocene fossils, from massive mammoths to the little legs of Ice Age woodpeckers. The asphalt deposits at the Tar Pits ensnared many animals over thousands of years, which now provide a terrific repository of ancient life for scientists hoping to learn more about ancient ecosystems, their climate, and their diverse occupants. 7 / 13 The Mammoth Site was born in the mid-1970s, after construction-related excavations reviewed a (not literal) handful of mammoth skeletons in Hot Springs, South Dakota. The mammoth bones—from 60 Columbian mammoths and three woolly mammoths, so far—are overwhelmingly male and appear to have died in what was an ancient sinkhole, according to Atlas Obscura . 8 / 13 Dinosaur National Monument’s Quarry Exhibit Hall houses about 1,500 dinosaur bones of some of the most iconic dinosaur species. The remains of Allosaurus, Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Stegosaurus, and more are included among the 150-million-year-old residents of the hall. Besides the dinosaurs at the monument, you can check out several petroglyph sites made by the Fremont people that once lived in the monument’s area. 9 / 13 14-foot-wide stumps of petrified redwoods and thousands of insect and plant fossils await you in Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument . That’s right, the ancient world is more than just mammoths and dinosaurs. The little organisms matter, too, and you can check them out at the visitor center and on the fossil trails. In the summertime, you can check out the on-site yurt that serves as a fossil lab. 10 / 13 A quarry of over 12,000 bones from at least 70 different ancient animals, located 5,800 feet above sea level. What’s not to like? There are also fossilized clam beds (see above) for the shellfish enthusiasts among us. Though the quarry is currently closed for the season, it will reopen on March 31 . 11 / 13 The area near Dallas and Fort Worth was once an ancient ocean. Dinosaurs walked along its beaches, and now, the Paluxy River plays host to their fossilized footprints. These trace fossils are sometimes submerged, but on dry days they are an awesome reminder of a more ancient Earth. 12 / 13 The “Aquarium in Stone,” as the National Parks Service has dubbed it , now lies high and dry in Wyoming. Rich with hiking trails and museum exhibits (featuring over 2,000 fossils from the monument’s Green River Formation), the fossilized aquarium of the ancient seas is well worth a trip. 13 / 13"

    "article_content": "The largest primate in our family tree went extinct hundreds of thousands of years ago, and its existence has been known to humankind for less than a century. Now, a team of researchers has reviewed the ancient records and devised a more specific extinction window for our huge fallen relative, Gigantopithecus blacki , and pointed out a few possible causes for its demise. The ape went extinct between 295,000 and 215,000 years ago, according to the new study. As the climate of southeast Asia changed, G. blacki could not change its eating habits or habitat. Its geographic footprint diminished, and before long, only fossilized teeth remained. The new research is published today in Nature. “The story of G. blacki is an enigma in palaeontology—how could such a mighty creature go extinct at a time when other primates were adapting and surviving?” said lead author Yingqi Zhang, a paleontologist at the Institute for Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in a statement. “The unresolved cause of its disappearance has become the Holy Grail in this discipline.” The search for the largest primate to ever exist began in 1935, when a German paleontologist happened upon a “dragon’s tooth” in a Hong Kong apothecary. It was a molar—not of a dragon, obviously, but an extinct ape, one that is estimated to have stood nearly 10 feet (3 meters) tall and weighed up to 661 pounds (300 kilograms). Scant evidence of G. blacki remains, tucked away in caves in southeast Asia. The ape’s fossil record is comprised of four mandibles and 2,000 teeth, the recent team reports. But their study expands the fossil record, drawing on newly discovered remains excavated from caves between 2017 and 2020. Prior to that, Zhang had found six caves containing G. blacki remains over the course of a decade. Twenty-two caves were sampled for the recent paper, and six dating techniques were used to corroborate the timeline of the ape’s extinction. Besides the fossil remains, the team looked at ancient pollens, sediments, and isotopes locked away in the cave floors, to understand the changing climate G. blacki was facing. Other apes faced it, too, including one of the giant ape’s closest relatives, Pongo weidenreichi , an ancient species of orangutan. The researchers determined that, as the climate changed, G. blacki didn’t adapt like its relatives in the region. As its food sources became unavailable due to the changing climate—the forest and grass ecosystem gave way to an open forest environment— G. Blacki resorted to less nutritious foods. “ G. blacki was the ultimate specialist, compared to the more agile adapters like orangutans, and this ultimately led to its demise,” Zhang said. Though P. weidenreichi also went extinct, it did so around 60,000 years ago —much more recently than the giant apes with which it shared southern Asia. And of course, three orangutan species remain extant, although all are critically endangered . “Understanding the causes of primate extinction is crucial with the threat of a sixth mass extinction event looming over the planet,” said co-lead author Kira Westaway, a geochronologist at Macquarie University, in an email to Gizmodo. “Going back to past unresolved extinctions and determining the causes helps us understand species responses to environmental stresses. This has massive implications for our living primates such as modern orangutans and mountain gorillas.” The climate is changing, and great apes are losing habitat due to human activities—farming, mining, and logging amongst them, according to the World Wildlife Fund . The orangutan is the only great ape left in Asia, and it is being pushed to extinction by palm oil producers . It’s easy to rue to loss of G. blacki , an animal of wondrous scale, but it will be even more painful to lose species we’re familiar with—which is why a global response to climate change is so crucial.

    "article_content": "Researchers believe they’ve found the oldest known fossilized skin, hidden away in a limestone cave system in Oklahoma. The skin sample dates to the early Permian Period, between 289 million years ago and 286 million years ago. The skin belonged to an ancient reptile and is epidermis—the outer layer of skin in amniotes, a group that includes terrestrial reptiles, mammals, and birds. A study describing the skin as well as several other fossils found in the cave system is published today in Current Biology. According to the research team, the recently discovered skin—smaller than a fingernail—is the first-known skin-cast fossil from the Paleozoic Era. The other fossils included skin compressions, skin bits from the ancient reptile Captorhinus aguti , and several scales of anamniotes—animals that reproduce in water. The bands of skin from the fossilized C. aguti came from just behind the animal’s head; the team was not able to associate all the amniote skin with specific ancient creatures. The epidermis is easy to overlook, but it protects the body from the harsh external world. It is the outermost layer of skin, keeping us hydrated and shielding us from everything from bacteria to extreme temperatures. The ancient skin studied by the team (and originally recovered in the cave and donated by Bill and Julie May) appears to have served a similar purpose for its ancient reptilian host. All skin samples found in the cave were preserved thanks to some serendipitous circumstances. “Animals would have fallen into this cave system during the early Permian and been buried in very fine clay sediments that delayed the decay process,” said Ethan Mooney, a paleontologist at the University of Toronto and lead author of the paper, in a Cell release . “But the kicker is that this cave system was also an active oil seepage site during the Permian, and interactions between hydrocarbons in petroleum and tar are likely what allowed this skin to be preserved.” Under the microscope, the skin’s surface bears similarities to crocodile skin, with hinges between scales similar to those seen in extant snakes and worm lizards. In the paper, the team notes that the skin’s morphology and its superlative age indicate that “this important organ for terrestrial vertebrate life was already present at the initial stages of amniote diversification.” That is, the epidermis already existed when early amniotes began to branch out into different forms of life. Ancient reptiles have a dynamic history that can be extricated from fossils. In 2022, a team revealed a 150-million-year-old fossil from Wyoming that clarified the evolutionary timeline of rhynchocephalians, a unique group of reptiles that has one living member: the tuatara. Of course, the recently analyzed skin is about twice as old as that ancient reptile, in a sobering reminder of how ‘deep’ deep time really is.

    "article_content": "O. megalodon, my megalodon. The gargantuan shark that prowled the Miocene seas has long captured the imagination because of its stupendous 60-foot length—three times the size of the largest great white sharks. But now, a team of researchers suggests that the extinct apex predator’s body shape was slightly different than expected. The enormous O. megalodon went extinct around 3.6 million years ago. Newborn megalodons were 6 feet long and may have had an appetite for their siblings ; recent studies on the species have generally estimated the adult sharks to grow between 50 feet and 65 feet long (15-20m). The team’s work— published in Palaeontologia Electronica—suggests that O. megalodon was not as bulky as the great white shark, based on a discrepancy in two previous calculations of one megalodon individual’s length. Megalodon remains are fragmentary, and inferences about the shark are generally made from its fist-sized teeth and vertebrae. In lieu of a complete (or at the least, more articulated) fossil, paleontologists have based the animal’s dimensions on its living relative, the great white. “ Otodus megalodon was previously envisioned to be a fast-swimming ‘warm-blooded’ shark, just like the modern great white shark, and that was the primary reason why the modern great white shark was used as a model for the body form of O. megalodon, ” wrote Kenshu Shimada, a paleobiologist at DePaul University in Chicago and co-author of the study, in an email to Gizmodo. But several findings have caused that reasoning to shift: after O. megalodon was confirmed to be warm-blooded, a different research team found the modern, slow-moving basking shark was also warm-blooded—indicating that the sluggish swimmers could just as easily have warm blood. Review of O. megalodon ’s scales published last year by a team including Shimada then indicated the apex predator was, indeed, a slower swimmer , that would probably swim fast only in short bursts while hunting. Philip Sternes, a biologist at University of California at Riverside and co-author of the new paper, said in a university release that a better model for O. megalodon’s shape may be the mako shark. That checks out: the shortfin mako is the ancient shark’s closest living relative, according to the Australia Museum . An endangered species, the shortfin mako is also the fastest shark: It can hit 46 miles per hour (74 kilometers per hour) in short bursts, according to the Smithsonian Institution . “Our study suggests that we need to think ‘outside the box’ when it comes to inferring the biology of O. megalodon ,” Shimada said. (Which is a relief, because imagine the logistics of megalodon-sized box.) While O. megalodon was still an absolute unit, it was likely more slender; basically the Victor Wembanyama of the ancient ocean. Sternes added that, with its skinny, elongated build, the megalodon may not have fed as frequently as previously thought. Alas, food availability is a prime suspect for what may have killed off the ancient shark. A team including Shimada posited that great white sharks may have outcompeted their larger relatives, leaving them as the largest lamniform in the sea.

    "article_content": "You won’t be-leaf the shape of this ancient tree. A team of researchers found a 350-million-year-old fossilized tree species that looks like something out of Dr. Seuss. The fossils are some of the oldest-known trees and were discovered in what was once an ancient lake in northeastern Canada. The species is called Sanfordiacaulis densifolia and would have taken up residence under the taller members of the forest canopy. The earliest fossil trees date back to the late Devonian Period, and these—from the early Carboniferous—are just a few million years younger. It’s not clear what Sanfordiacaulis’ closest relations are on the tree of life (no pun intended), which means it’s incertae sedis— an enigmatic taxa. Dr. Seuss’ Truffula trees were probably inspired by a cypress tree that died in 2019 , but one could argue that these real-life trees were even more alien. Research describing the ancient vegetation from leaf to trunk is published today in Current Biology. “We estimate that each leaf grew at least another meter before terminating,” said Robert Gastaldo, a paleontologist at Colby College and the study’s lead author, in a Cell release . “This means that the ‘bottle brush’ had a dense canopy of leaves that extended at least 5.5 meters (or 18 feet) around a trunk that was non-woody and only 16 centimeters (or 0.5 feet) in diameter. Startling to say the least.” The ancient trees in New Brunswick were preserved when an earthquake pushed foliage on the edge of a lake into the water, pressing the trees into the lakebed. The recent paper focuses on the most complete of five tree specimens preserved in sandstone and siltstone on the ancient lake site, now a quarry. Based on the shape of the tree—with an immense canopy proportional to the rest of its size—the researchers concluded that Sanfordiacaulis optimized its growth by intercepting light from the greenery in its immediate environs. The fossils reveal that the tree could host about 250 leaves around its trunk, each stretching nearly 6 feet (1.75 meters) out from the trunk. “The history of life on land consists of plants and animals that are unlike any of those that live at the present,” Gastaldo said in a statement. “Evolutionary mechanisms operating in the deep past resulted in organisms that successfully lived over long periods of time, but their shapes, forms, growth architectures, and life histories undertook different trajectories and strategies. Rare and unusual fossils, such as the New Brunswick tree, is but one example of what colonized our planet but was an unsuccessful experiment.” More: See Nature Way Up-Close in These Award-Winning Photographs"

    "article_content": "Paleontologists found a fossilized pterosaur—a flying reptile that lived alongside the dinosaurs—fittingly on Scotland’s Isle of Skye. Dubbed C eoptera evansae, the 165-million-year-old pterosaur is the second one found in Scotland to date and it could clue researchers into how pterosaurs diversified. Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight , which they used to occupy the ecological niches later occupied by seabirds, storks, and other airborne creatures. C. evansae was actually found in 2006 on Skye’s southwestern coast, but the team then spent time excavating the fossil and CT-scanning parts of the bone that were too delicate to separate from the stone in which they were found. The team’s research describing the fossil was published this week in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology . “Pterosaur fossils have a very poor fossil record in general, as their bones are quite fragile,” said Paul Barrett, a paleontologist at London’s Natural History Museum and co-author of the study, in a museum release . “As flying animals, they’re also not spending as much time on the ground near the rivers and lakes where fossils usually form.” C. evansae is just the latest pterosaur found on Skye. In February 2022, paleontologists announced the discovery of Dearc sgiathanach , a winged reptile from the Middle Jurassic. D. sgiathanach had a roughly 8-foot-wide wingspan, making it the largest creature of its kind found from the Jurassic. That’s not to say it was the largest pterosaur, though. That title belongs to Quetzalcoatlus , a North American pterosaur that stood 12 feet (3.66 meters) tall with a 40-foot (12.2 m) wingspan, making it the largest flying animal ever known. C. evansae ’s estimated wingspan was a little over 5 feet (1.6 m), making it a scrawnier pterosaur than the other Scottish specimen. Nevertheless, C. evansae adds to a growing portfolio of ancient life in what is now Scotland alongside D. sgiathanach . Both hailing from the Jurassic, the two pterosaurs indicate that there was a diversity of flying reptiles in the area. “We now think that the darwinopterans persisted for around 25 million years alongside a rich diversity of other pterosaurs, including Dearc ,” Barrett added. “This overlap is very rarely found in the fossil record, with China and the UK currently the only places where this is known.” Analysis of the pterosaur also showed off paleontologists’ relatively new ability to digitally prepare fossils, using CT scanning to see bones that cannot be excavated. Researchers can then create 3D maps of the fossil in-situ, and even digitally reconstruct the ancient animals. The record of pterosaur fossil record from Scotland was barren for centuries, but with two pterosaurs found on Skye in as many years, we may be in for a watershed moment for understanding the ecology of the Middle Jurassic.

    "article_content": "Sorry to all fans of Tridentinosaurus antiquus , thought to be a remarkably preserved 280-million-year-old lizard. A new paper published in Paleontology posits that the early reptile fossil is in fact a forgery. The striking rock was found in the Italian alps in 1931; dark against the background, the soft tissue of all four limbs and the tail appears immaculately spared from the ravages of time. “The peculiar preservation of Tridentinosaurus had puzzled experts for decades,” said Evelyn Kustatscher, a paleontologist at the Museum of Nature South Tyrol, in a University College Cork release . “Now, it all makes sense. What was described as carbonized skin is just paint.” Womp womp, as they say. Long thought to be a fossil that could yield information about the evolution of early reptiles, it turns out what was thought to be preserved soft tissue was actually much more modern. UV imaging of the specimen indicated it was coated with a lacquer or varnish, but the researchers harbored hope that remnants of the animal’s soft tissue lay beneath. Unfortunately, there was just paint. The team believes that the painters of the fossil (whomever they were) did so to make the specimen look more impressive. That’s right: the fossil is not a complete forgery. The researchers found that the animal’s hindlimbs—the femurs—appear legitimate, though not well preserved. And the team found what appear to be osteoderms, bony skin that makes up scales, in the animal’s back. “Fossil soft tissues are rare, but when found in a fossil they can reveal important biological information, for instance, the external colouration, internal anatomy and physiology,” said Valentina Rossi, a paleontologist at University College Cork and the team leader, in the release. “The answer to all our questions was right in front of us, we had to study this fossil specimen in detail to reveal its secrets – even those that perhaps we did not want to know.” Sure, it took 93 years to get an answer to the nature of this suspiciously robust specimen. But the important thing is that the truth prevailed. More: Paleontologist Accused of Making Up Data on Dinosaur-Killing Asteroid Impact"

    "article_content": "Amber fossils are like a time capsule, preserving the three-dimensional structure of animals, plants, and other prehistoric items of interest. Every once in a while, however, paleontologists stumble upon some particularly bizarre specimens and scenes. Conventional fossils, with their faintly outlined pancaked specimens, can teach us plenty about the past, but they lack a certain pizzazz. Amber fossils, on the other hand, are filled with all sorts of excitement, exhibiting features that still appear fresh despite being millions of years old. And because many creatures became preserved in amber by inadvertently getting caught in tree resin, their final behaviors and predicaments are often on full display. Here are some of the more unusual amber fossils discovered over the years. This story was originally published on October 24, 2020. 2 / 12 Some 41 million years ago, during the Late Middle Eocene, a pair of long-legged flies ( Dolichopodidae ) were getting it on when a drop of tree resin ruined their fun . Paleontologists believe it’s the first example of “frozen behavior” in the Australian fossil record, as most amber fossils are found in the Northern Hemisphere. 3 / 12 In 2017, scientists described a new species of insect called Aethiocarenus burmanicus , which was found in 100-million-year-old Burmese amber. The Cretaceous critter exhibited features never seen before in an insect, such as a triangle-shaped head, an awkward pair of googly eyes, and glands on its neck. Though the paleontologists who studied the specimen never admitted it, they had stumbled upon one seriously butt-ugly bug. 4 / 12 Amber can also preserve micro-scale creatures, such as these bizarre mold pigs . Discovered in 2019, these tiny animals resemble tardigrades, which are sometimes referred to as water bears. The Cenozoic microinvertebrates were found in the Dominican Republic and dated at 30 million years old. The creatures were named mold pigs on account of their portly appearance and fungi-rich diet. 5 / 12 On one fateful Cretaceous day, a hapless tick managed to get itself caught in some spider silk prior to getting stuck in a sticky drop of tree sap. A seriously unfortunate day for the tick, but the discovery marked “the first time that this specific interaction between ticks and spiders has been documented in the fossil record,” according to the researchers. 6 / 12 Research from 2019 detailed a piece of amber containing dino feathers and a louse-like insect named Mesophthirus engeli . Tell-tale damage to feathers suggests the bugs were in fact parasitizing their host , not just hanging out among discarded feathers in the same plop of tree resin. This piece of amber was found in Myanmar and dates back some 100 million years. 7 / 12 This male damselfly, caught inside 100-million-year-old Burmese amber, was trying to court a female when nature had other plans. At his moment of death, the damselfly had assumed a special pose in which he could show off his exaggerated forearms and hindlegs, in what the scientists called an extreme example of sexual display . 8 / 12 Daddy longlegs, in addition to their extended appendages, are endowed in other ways as well, as this chunk of Cretaceous amber revealed back in 2016. Here’s how I described the discovery at the time: When it died, this ancient creature was clearly in a state of arousal, and possibly in the vicinity of a female. How it went from a potential union to paleontological posterity is anyone’s guess. Perhaps it fell into oozing resin amid all the sexual excitement. Alternately, the male daddy longlegs may have accidentally fallen into some tree resin as it was going about its daily business, and as it was struggling, its blood pressure rose, forcing its penis to squeeze out accidentally. This insect’s penis was so unique in terms of its shape, scientists had to create an entirely new family of arachnids, and a new species, Halitherses grimaldii . As the researchers wrote: “This is the first record of a male copulatory organ of this nature preserved in amber and is of special importance due to the age of the deposit,” which dates back some 99 million years. 9 / 12 This is one of my favorite amber fossils, both because of the dramatic scene and the exquisite level of preservation. What a moment for the resin to suddenly pour down over the pair, as the spider was about to chomp down on the parasitic wasp, which may have been poaching spider eggs at the time (oof). This piece of amber—the first to document a spider attack—was found in Myanmar, and it dates back to the Late Cretaceous, between 97 million and 110 million years ago. 10 / 12 Dating back about 44 million to 49 million years ago, this is the oldest example of a mite attached to its host . The mite is similar to those around today, leading scientists to believe it was parasitizing the ant, rather than attacking it. 11 / 12 This remarkable amber fossil was originally thought to contain the smallest dinosaur in the fossil record (a kind of hummingbird-like creature), but a reassessment of the fossil, along with newfound evidence, forced a re-think, with scientists concluding that the tiny skull likely belonged to a lizard. Still, it’s a damned cool specimen. 12 / 12"

    "article_content": "After death, we all run the risk of being forgotten. Such was the case of Garzapelta muelleri , an ancient reptile that lived over 200 million years ago and even went unidentified for 30 years after its bony remains were found. Garzapelta is an aetosaur, a group of archosaurs more closely related to the ancestors of crocs and alligators than birds. But in paleoart reconstructions (see above), the animal looks like if a crocodile were much more polite. Aetosaurs’ upturned snouts and concealed teeth make the primarily herbivorous reptiles a little more approachable (at least as an idea) than their living relatives. Research describing the Garzapelta fossil—which has been collecting dust on a shelf at Texas Tech University for the better part of 30 years—was published earlier this year in The Anatomical Record. The ancient creature is named for Garza County, Texas, where it was found, the shieldlike carapace (“pelta”) it wore, and its original discoverer, the paleontologist Bill Mueller. As far as anatomies go, Garzapelta ’s is worth recording. The large animal was armored like an ankylosaur, a bonafide dinosaur recognizable (besides the armor plating) for its clubbed tail. Those bony plates, or osteoderms, made the animal a much more formidable undertaking for Triassic carnivores. The holotype specimen—described in the recent paper—is a Garzapelta carapace that is roughly 70% complete and features most of the animal’s body. “We have elements from the back of the neck and shoulder region all the way to the tip of the tail,” said William Reyes, a researcher at the University of Texas and the study’s lead author, in a university release. “Usually, you find very limited material.” Similar to some ankylosaurs, whose bony spikes grew right out of their ribs , Garzapelta ’s sides were covered in curved spikes that gave it additional protection. But even being covered in spikes, armor, and probably weighing at least a few tons can’t change my impression of this ancient croc relative: it’s cute. They don’t make ‘em like they used to.

The new species is dubbed Ichthyotitan severnensis and may have been over 80 feet long, according to the team’s estimates. The finding means that ichthyosaurs could have grown nearly as large as blue whales, which have long reigned as the undisputed biggest animals known to science. The team described I. severnensis in a study published today in PLoS One. Though the animal’s length is an educated guess based on the size of its jawbone, if the estimates are correct then the newly described species could grow about 10 feet longer than S. sikanniensis , the next largest ichthyosaur. Ichthyosaurs were ancient, sea-dwelling reptiles that disappeared about 90 million years ago. Though they shared the planet with dinosaurs— bar the last 30-million-odd years of the latter’s tenure—ichthyosaurs belong to a different branch on the tree of life. The largest ichthyosaurs were the shastasaurids, a group that ranged in size from about 20 feet (6 meters) long to over 60 feet (20m) long— I. severnensis being the latest, most superlative example. Ichthyosaurs remains are all over Europe. In 2022, a different team of paleontologists identified three ichthyosaur fossils in the Swiss Alps , some 9,000 feet above sea level, and recent studies have revealed an ichthyosaur fossil with a fossilized embryo inside it and even on ichthyosaur with its last meal still halfway down its gullet . But only the shastasaurids reached gargantuan size—not quite as big as blue whales, the largest animals ever known, but bigger than sperm and humpback whales. There was “an interesting diversity of very big ichthyosaurs at the end of the Triassic, just before the mass extinction 201 million years ago,” Heinz Furrer, a paleontologist at the University of Zürich and co-author of the paper on the alpine ichthyosaur finds, told Gizmodo in 2022. “Together with a nearly time-equivalent find in British Columbia, they were the biggest marine reptiles that ever lived on Earth.” Last week, paleontologists from the University of Bonn published a study in PeerJ confirming that several large chunks of bone found across Europe over the last 150 years belonged to giant ichthyosaurs, rather than dinosaurs. Indeed, evidence of shastasaurids mainly pops up in their fossilized teeth and vertebrae. “The fossils were and still are so tantalizing that I like to liken them to ghosts,” said Martin Sander, lead author of the 2022 ichthyosaur paper and co-author of last week’s work, in an email to Gizmodo. “Dominating the world’s ocean for 25 million years before the end of the Triassic (202 [million years ago]) but we hardly know what they looked like!” In 2018, a team described a 205-million-year-old jawbone from the same stretch of Somerset, in England. They compared the jawbone with the same bone in Shonisaurus sikanniensis , the largest known ichthyosaur, which grew to about 70 feet long. The 2018 jawbone was a bit bigger, indicating the animal it belonged to was even more giant than S. sikanniensis. “We had hoped that one day another [jawbone] would come to light,” said Dean Lomax, a paleontologist at the University of Manchester and lead author of the paper, in a PLOS release. “This new specimen is more complete, better preserved, and shows that we now have two of these giant bones (called a surangular) that have a unique shape and structure.” In a fun bonus, the jaw bone—a surangular, to be specific—also contained several bivalve fossils and trace fossils, evidence of probable scavenging by other ancient creatures. The largest animal ever known to exist is the blue whale, which can grow to about 100 feet long (30.5 meters) and weigh about 200 tons. The blue whale still swims in Earth’s oceans today, though it is endangered. Of course, the whale is also a mammal. Though the I. severnensis size estimate is shy of the blue whale’s length, it closes the gap. It’s also way, way bigger than the largest extant marine reptile, the saltwater crocodile, which can grow to about 17 feet long —still smaller than the smallest shastasaurids. “Lomax et al decided to give the ghost a name, Ichthyotitan ,” Sander said. “I think that’s a good idea although it still remains a ghost, but it is easier to talk about a ghost with a name than a nameless one.” More: Fossils of Giant Dolphin-Like Marine Reptiles Found in Swiss Alps"

    "article_content": "A newly described fossil snake in India may be the largest that ever lived, according to a team that studied 27 vertebrae recovered from a lignite mine in India. The new species is dubbed Vasuki indicus —named for India and the mythical serpent that wraps itself around the neck of the Hindu god Shiva. Extrapolating the serpent’s length from the vertebrae, which appeared to come from a full-grown individual, the researchers calculated that the giant snake could have been about 50 feet (15.2 meters) long, about two and a half times longer than a giraffe is tall. “The most important finding of our study is the identification of an exceptionally large snake, which not only adds to the existing knowledge of madtsoiid snakes but also adds to the known diversity of snakes from the Cenozoic of India,” said Sunil Bajpai, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee and co-author of the study, in an email to Gizmodo. The team’s research is published today in Scientific Reports. The snake lived in India about 47 million years ago, when the subcontinent was still drifting over to Asia from Africa and average temperatures sat around 82.4 degree Fahrenheit (28 Celsius). It was a madtsoiid , an extinct family of snakes that mainly originated on Gondwana , an ancient supercontinent that contained South America, Africa, India, Australia, Arabia, and Antarctica. “There are a number of possible reasons for its large size, which range from favorable environment with ample food resources to lack of natural predators,” Bajpai said. “Another driving force could be the prevalence of warmer climatic conditions than at present. Since snakes are poikilotherms, their internal body temperature fluctuates with the ambient temperature of the environment. So, higher ambient temperatures would have increased the internal body temperature and metabolic rate of Vasuki, which in turn would have allowed it to grow so large.” The longest extant snake is the reticulated python ( M. reticulatus ), which regularly grows to over 20 feet (6.25 meters) long. According to London’s Natural History Museum , the longest specimen known was found in 1912 and measured just under 33 feet (10 meters). If the team’s estimates are correct, Vasuki may have been longer than Titanoboa , a gigantic boa that lived in South America about 60 million years ago. “It is worth noting that the largest body-length estimates of Vasuki appear to exceed that of Titanoboa , even though the vertebral dimensions of the Indian taxon are slightly smaller than those of Titanoboa ,” the study authors wrote. Based on the distribution of other madtsoiid snakes, the research team posits that Vasuki distributed west across southern Eurasia to Africa after India smashed into Asia. A sufficiently serpentine route for such a superlative snake. Based on its size, the researchers posit that Vasuki was a slow-moving ambush predator—similar to modern-day anacondas. “Modern snakes are not so large, possibly because the temperatures are lower at present preventing them from reaching gigantic proportions,” Bajpai said. “Loss of habitat, competition from other predators (e.g., crocodilians) and poaching may also play a role.” I like a warm summer day as much as anyone, but I guess chilly weather is a small price to pay for skipping out on the whole “giant snake overlords” thing.

    "article_content": "Pitch-black darkness. Crushing squeezes, muddy passages, icy waterfalls. Bats and spiders. Abseiling over ledges into the unknown. How far would you go for a fossil? On a two-year retrieval mission of nearly 60 hours in an underground cave, we met our limits—and went beyond. The limestone slope of Potholes Cave Reserve is found in Gunaikurnai Country, north of the township of Buchan in eastern Victoria, Australia. Here, the river valley is peppered with shadowy entrances to underground caves. Portals barely large enough to permit a willing caver open into kilometers of subterranean passages encrusted with delicate crystals twinkling in torchlight . In one of them, Nightshade Cave, the Museums Victoria Research Institute led a team of recreational cavers and Parks Victoria rangers to excavate an extraordinary fossil: a near-complete skeleton of the extinct short-faced kangaroo Simosthenurus occidentalis . In June this year, it will appear on display at Melbourne Museum. As is so often the case in palaeontology, the discovery began with engaged citizens out in nature. In 2011, a local caving group first entered Nightshade Cave through an opening previously blocked by soil. One of the group, Joshua Van Dyk, sighted an unusual animal skull. Recognising its potential significance, he reported the find to Melbourne Museum. However, Van Dyk reckoned it was irretrievable, appearing to be crushed under boulders in a narrow vertical collapse. The cave was gated shut to protect its contents and a decade passed quietly. In 2021, I took an interest in the intriguing find. Members of the Victorian Speleological Association were only too happy to assist a return to the cave. Rigging a ropeline, we abseiled down a tight 10-meter (32.8-foot) rift, emptying our lungs to pass tight points in midair. We corkscrewed into a narrow passage and wormed, single-file, through low-domed chambers hung with dripping stalactites and plastered by popcorn-like calcite formations. Descending deeper, the cave transformed into tall, narrow, clean-walled rifts, full of dark recesses. Hours passed as we circuited the passages, until a shout echoed around: found again! We scrambled to a chimney-like chute stacked with pinned boulders, to come eye to eye with an ancient. On reaching it, I felt sudden grief: the beautiful fossilised skull had in the intervening years begun to collapse. It seemed that, despite its long survival, the fossil was newly vulnerable—from little more than the altered air currents and changing humidity caused by the new cave entrance. We strengthened the exposed bones with protective resins, but exited the cave having left them in place; more time would be needed to plan their retrieval. On our return trips, I carefully brushed away fine layers of mud and we photographed and packed the newly freed fossils. The skull had a deep muzzle, with robust jaws and teeth that marked it as a short-faced (sthenurine) kangaroo. Behind it were more bones. It was a marvel to see vertebrae, shoulders and hips, limbs and a narrow ribcage: many of the bones were wholly undisturbed and still in their original positions. This was a single animal, not a random scattering of bones. It felt like a fossil holy grail. A detailed comparison to fossils in the Museums Victoria State Collection gave our skeleton its identification as Simosthenurus occidentalis . Comprising 150 preserved bones, it is the most complete fossil skeleton found in a Victorian cave to date. That it is a juvenile rather than adult kangaroo further distinguishes it from other examples of the species. Its teeth show little wear, its skull bones are still unfused, and its limb ends had not yet joined, suggesting it was still young at its time of death. From the size of its limbs , we estimate it weighed around 80 kilograms (176 pounds)—as much as an average person—but might have grown half as large again had it reached adulthood. Short-faced kangaroos appear in Australia’s fossil record from 10 to 15 million years ago, as widespread rainforests began to give way to drier habitats. They became particularly diverse during the shift toward our current arid climate in the later part of the Pleistocene Epoch, from around 500,000 years ago. But in a pulse of extinction around 45,000 years ago , they vanished across the continent, along with up to 85% of Australia’s megafauna. Radiocarbon dating by the Australian Nuclear Science & Technology Organisation dated the skeleton’s burial to 49,400 years ago. This means our S. occidentalis was among the very last of its kind. Today, the hills of eastern Gippsland host a precious population of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby , a vulnerable species. Once, they shared the country with larger kin. A key idea under investigation is whether sthenurine kangaroos walked with a striding gait, rather than hopped . The skeleton we found has a uniquely complete vertebral column, providing new insights we couldn’t get from isolated bones. With the benefit of detailed 3D models, this near-complete skeleton can also be studied from anywhere in the world. This fossil, along with others from Nightshade Cave, is now housed and cared for in perpetuity at Melbourne Museum . Through Museums Victoria Research Institute, we can preserve a link to its once home of East Gippsland, while opening a door to global research.

    "article_content": "Tyrannosaurus rex was just about as smart as modern crocodiles and other reptiles, according to a team of researchers that investigated recent claims that the Cretaceous predators may have been as smart as monkeys. In its work, the team specifically referenced a paper published last year in the Journal Comparative Neurology . Written by the neuroscientist Suzana Herculano-Houzel, the paper inferred that theropods like Tyrannosaurus had “monkey-like” numbers of neurons, “which would make these animals not only giant but also long-lived and endowed with flexible cognition.” The new team’s paper pushes back on those claims, arguing that theropod dinosaurs probably had “significantly lower neuron counts than previously proposed”; the team added that neuron count and relative brain size are “flawed” proxies for measuring ancient animals’ smarts and other aspects of the creatures’ biologies. “We argue that it’s not good practice to predict intelligence in extinct species when neuron counts reconstructed from endocasts are all we have to go on,” said Kai Caspar, a biologist at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf and the study’s lead author, in a University of Bristol release . Dino organs—including brains— don’t preserve particularly well over tens of millions of years. When it does, it tends to be stuff like dinosaur skin , not internal organs. Indeed, the oldest fossilized skin is nearly 300 million years old, making it much more ancient than T. rex. Thus, scientists turn to other lines of evidence to determine how bright the animals were. Herculano-Houzel’s paper used an existing database of neuron counts in extant sauropsids (a group that includes birds and squamates) and scaled it to dinosaurs and pterosaurs, which have been extinct for about 66 million years. “Readers should analyze the evidence and draw their own conclusions,” Herculano-Houzel told the LA Times . “That’s what science is about!” The animal kingdom has a bevy of intelligent creatures; when Gizmodo asked experts which animal might develop human-level intelligence in the future, they had some interesting—and diverse—answers . Plenty of animals (including reptiles!) use tools , and some (besides monkeys) exhibit self-awareness , even if they still fall for magic tricks . But it’s easier to study the animals around today, than to extrapolate the intelligence of an animal whose fossilized brains aren’t even around to poke and prod, much less a living creature to put through tests. “The possibility that T. rex might have been as intelligent as a baboon is fascinating and terrifying, with the potential to reinvent our view of the past,” said Darren Naish, a paleozoologist at the University of Southampton and co-author of the paper, in the same release. “But our study shows how all the data we have is against this idea. They were more like smart giant crocodiles, and that’s just as fascinating.” Theropods—and especially T. rex —attract a distinctive degree of fervor. After all, they were particularly fearsome predators and have an outsized presence in popular culture compared to other dinosaurs. Even if T. rex wasn’t as smart as modern monkeys, it’s still a very scary animal. I’d rather researchers debate the intelligence of the long-gone T. rex than try some ill-fated experiment to see how clever they are when alive...I think I’ve read that script before.

    "article_content": "The fossil shark Ptychodus was first identified 190 years ago, but in the intervening centuries of paleontological inquiry, a comprehensive look at the ancient fish has been hard to come by. Until now. In a paper published last week in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, a team of researchers describe an exceptionally well-preserved Ptychodus, fossilized from its nose to the tip of its tail. In their research, the paleontologists analyzed six near-complete Ptychodus specimens excavated from Vallecillo, Mexico, over the last decade. The specimens reveal the sharks’ skeletal components as well as their preserved body outlines. The team used the fossils to determine new information about the sharks’ anatomy and their place in the shark family tree. “This new study provides crucial information on the affinities [evolutionary relations] and the paleoecology of Ptychodus ,” said Romain Vullo, a paleontologist at the University of Rennes in France and lead author of the paper, in an email to Gizmodo. “So far, this Cretaceous shark was only known from isolated teeth, dentitions [sets of teeth], and a few skeletal elements such as vertebrae.” “The complete specimens from Mexico reveal that Ptychodus was a fast-swimming open water shark (similar in shape to the living porbeagle), which likely used its grinding dentition to feed mostly on ammonites and sea turtles,” Vullo added. In 2021, Vullo was the lead author on a paper describing Aquilolamna milarcae , a bizarre-looking Cretaceous era lamniform shark that was excavated from the same sweep of eastern Mexico. In the recent paper, the team also classified Ptychodus as a lamniform—a mackerel shark—and posit that the animal’s extinction may have occurred due to competition with mosasaurs , an extinct group of giant marine reptiles. But the reality may be more complicated, as Tyler Greenfield, a paleontologist at the University of Wyoming, explained to Gizmodo. Instead of being a mackerel shark, Greenfield suggests Ptychodus belongs to an entirely different category. “Sharks of the order Lamniformes have specific patterns of the sizes and shapes of the teeth, the hollow sections in the jaws that hold the rows of teeth, and the cartilage structures inside the vertebrae that Ptychodus does not have,” Greenfield, who is not affiliated with the new paper, wrote in an email. “Those features were overlooked by the authors of the new paper and they instead used certain characteristics of the cranium and jaws, which are not unique to lamniforms, to classify Ptychodus.” Greenfield added that, based on similarities between Ptychodus and both Squalicorax and Ptychocorax (two other species of ancient shark), the shark family including Ptychodus and the one including the latter two species ought to be placed in a separate order, Anacoraciformes, or crow sharks. “Anacoraciformes was named by other authors before me, but it has not been used as valid since then nor has it included ptychodontids until now,” Greenfield said, adding that the teeth built for crushing shelled prey would likely have evolved outside of Lamniformes. “Overall, my hypothesis seeks to build a more accurate picture of the relationships and diversity of prehistoric sharks,” Greenfield said. One might assume that such immaculately preserved fossils would settle aspects of the shark’s phylogeny, not complicate it. But regardless of how the dust settles regarding Ptychodus ’ classification, it is refreshing—and indeed, incredibly fortunate—that paleontologists have such well-preserved specimens to use in making their determinations.

    "article_content": "To the untrained eye, the ancient brittle star fossil above looks like what you’d expect of a now-especially-brittle echinoderm. But the fossil is quite rare: It captures the moment at which the brittle star was cloning itself, regenerating three of its arms as it died. The specimen was a chance find during a 2018 dig in a limestone deposit west of Nusplingen, Germany. The same fossil bed yielded ancient sponges, crinoids, and ammonite coprolites and beaks. If you look closely, you’ll see the three arms on the fossil’s right side are thinner and slightly shorter than those on its left side. To the team’s knowledge, the specimen is just the second case of a fossil with a regenerating body half, and the first in which its regeneration appears connected to the animal’s six-fold symmetry and clonal fragmentation. The newly defined species— Ophiactis Hex —dates to the Late Jurassic, about 150 million years ago. Brittle stars are not starfish ; though both typically have five arms, they constitute different classes of echinoderms, the same invertebrate group that includes sea cucumbers (brittle stars and starfish do share a common ancestor, however). Though many brittle stars are five-armed, the study authors note that O. hex “shows a regular six-fold symmetry without any signs of accidental ray addition, suggesting that the individual was hexamerous before fragmentation.” However, they note that it is not possible to say for sure that the animal was regularly six-armed from just one specimen. Based on its features, including its small body size and arm spines, the team concluded that the brittle star had an epizoic lifestyle: It lived on a host creature, perhaps sponges that grew in the same environment. The new paper appears in Royal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Whatever other conclusions might be drawn from the fossil—about brittle star evolution, or cloning in evolutionary history—what is clear is that the fossil is pretty freakin’ cool.

    "article_content": "A winemaker’s renovation project in Gobelsburg, Austria, has led to the discovery of mammoth bones dating back up to 40,000 years, providing potential new insights into Upper Paleolithic hunting practices. A seemingly routine renovation in Gobelsburg, Austria, has led to a remarkable paleontological and anthropological find. Winemaker Andreas Pernerstorfer stumbled upon huge bones in March while upgrading his wine cellar. He reported the discovery to the Federal Monuments Office, which redirected him to the Austrian Archaeological Institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW), according to a press release . Since the beginning of May, a team of archaeologists has been investigating and uncovering a significant layer of mammoth bones lying on top of each other. The bones are thought to be between 30,000 and 40,000 years old, making it the most significant find of its kind in over a century. ÖAW says similar sites in Austria and neighboring countries were mostly excavated over 100 years ago, and as a result, are forever lost to modern research techniques. ÖAW archaeologist Hannah Parow-Souchon, who is leading the excavation, highlighted the rarity of such a dense layer of bones, saying it’s “the first time that we have been able to examine something like this in Austria using modern means—a unique opportunity for research.” The researchers are now documenting the site with 3D mapping technology, according to the History Blog. The discovery raises many questions about Upper Paleolithic hunting practices. “We know that people hunted mammoths, but we still know very little about how they did it,” said Parow-Souchon. The site could either be where the animals died naturally or where people set a trap for them, the archaeologists speculate. Remarkably, bones from at least three different mammoths have been found at the site. This discovery aligns with a nearby site where flint artifacts, jewelry, fossils, and charcoal were found 150 years ago, suggesting both sites are related and from the same timeframe. Once the excavation is complete, the finds will be handed over to the Natural History Museum in Vienna for restoration. Hopefully, Pernerstorfer can avoid finding more big bones, finish his renovations, and enjoy some nice wine. More : Enormous 18th-Century Ice House Re-Discovered Under London Street"

    "article_content": "An Ice Age bird that weighed twice as much as an ostrich was adapted for the water, say a team of researchers who recently studied fossils from creature, which went extinct about 45,000 years ago. Based on bones of Genyornis newtoni found in South Australia’s Lake Callabonna, the animal weighed about 500 pounds (230 kilograms), making it five times as heavy as the fearsome southern cassowary. The recent trove of remains, including a nearly foot-long skull, was found in 2019. The only other known skull of Genyornis was found in 1913, and it was heavily damaged. 128 years later, the new fossils—and new technology—allowed a research team to make more detailed conclusions about the life and times of this giant bird. Their research is published today in Historical Biology. Lake Callabonna is “a bit of a megafauna necropolis,” said Jacob Blokland, a paleontologist at Flinders University and a co-author of the paper, in an email to Gizmodo. “This site has been on record since the late 1800s, but has likely been part of indigenous knowledge for far far longer.” “At this time Genyornis was thought to be a ‘struthious bird’, more related to cassowaries and emus, so subsequent reconstructions were influenced by such,” Blokland added. The team’s research has shaken up those conclusions. The bird’s upper jaw was tall like a parrot’s but shaped like a goose’s (hence its ‘giga-goose’ nickname, as dubbed in a Taylor & Francis release ). It had a large braincase and a casque, an enlargement of the bone on the top of its head. Though the animal was compared to large birds due to its size, the recent work finds the animal was morphologically similar to modern waterfowl like the South American screamers . “The new skull material for this Genyornis has revealed a goose-like bill and several specialist features of the skull that are related to the bird submerging its skull in the water. This bird must have foraged in the water at least some of the time, perhaps eating soft aquatic weeds or new plant shoots. It also has hindlimb adaptations for traveling across hard ground, and might have travelled from lake to lake, eating fruits and the like along the way.” Genyornis went extinct about 45,000 years ago, meaning it shared Earth with anatomically modern humans and even Neanderthals (though the latter were not in Australia). There’s no archaeological or anthropological evidence that humans and Genyornis interacted, though they did inhabit the same area at the same time. “We cannot for certain say why Genyornis went extinct because it’s likely a complex interaction of multiple variables,” said Phoebe McInerney, a paleontologist at Flinders University in a Australia and the study’s lead author, in an email to Gizmodo. “However, with the skull showing these birds to have adaptations for being in and around water, this suggests that they lived and relied on semi-aquatic environments.” “During the time Genyornis was alive, the inland lakes of South Australia were experiencing drought phases and were slowly transitioning to the salty and dry state they are in today,” McInerney added. “This would have likely contributed to Genyornis becoming locally extinct in this region.” While the cause of its disappearance remains uncertain, the bird’s morphology and its ecological niche are now much clearer. More fossils may continue to develop paleontologists’ understanding of this gigantic goose-like forager. More: Fossil Reveals ‘Wonderchicken,’ the Earliest Known Modern Bird"

    "article_content": "Scientists have discovered a new, very cool-looking dinosaur. The intricately horned beast is a relative of the famous Triceratops and has been named Lokiceratops rangiformis . It’s thought to have roamed around the western half of North America over 78 million years ago, back when the continent was split into several large island masses. The discovery and naming of L. rangiformis was made by a large group of researchers from the U.S., Canada, UK, Denmark, and Panama. The fossils used to determine its identity were excavated from the badlands of northern Montana, not too far from Canada. Back then, the area was thought to have primarily been swamps and floodplains. And L. rangiformis is thought to have made its home along the eastern shores of Laramidia—an island continent during the Late Cretaceous period that existed as a result of the Western Interior Seaway splitting what we now call North America into two. The dinosaur’s first name refers to the Norse God Loki, known for his horned attire, while the second is a nod to caribou, present-day animals that tend to have asymmetric antlers. Put the two together and L. rangiformis literally means: “Loki’s horned face that looks like a caribou.” L. rangiformis is part of a diverse group of dinosaurs known as ceratopsids, which are thought to have first emerged around 92 million years ago. Ceratopsids were successful as a whole, with members living all the way up until the end of the dinosaur age 66 million years ago (when, you know...). But scientists believe that L. rangiformis belonged to a much more narrow niche of these dinosaurs. The team’s discovery was detailed in a paper published Thursday in the journal PeerJ , while the Natural History Museum of Utah and other affiliated institutions are unveiling the dinosaur to the public this week. The team has also made available beautiful reconstructions of these dinosaurs and three other ceratopsian species that lived alongside it. “This new dinosaur pushes the envelope on bizarre ceratopsian headgear, sporting the largest frill horns ever seen in a ceratopsian,” said co-lead author Joseph Sertich, a paleontologist with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and Colorado State University, in a statement released by the University of Utah, which manages the museum. L. rangiformis is the fourth such ceratopsid and fifth horned dinosaur overall to be identified in the area, which has led paleontologists to reassess the evolutionary branch of these animals. The isolated nature of living in Laramidia may have driven L. rangiformis and other ceratopsids to evolve in drastic ways. Fearsome as the horns might appear to us today, the researchers believe that they were more like ornaments, used to entice females into mating. “These skull ornaments are one of the keys to unlocking horned dinosaur diversity and demonstrate that evolutionary selection for showy displays contributed to the dizzying richness of Cretaceous ecosystems,” said Sertich."

    "article_content": "Artificial intelligence is everywhere these days, but the fundamentals of how this influential new technology work can be difficult to wrap your head around. Two of the most important fields in AI development are “machine learning” and its sub-field, “deep learning,” although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, leading to a certain amount of confusion. Here’s a quick explanation of what these two important disciplines are, and how they’re contributing to the evolution of automation. Proponents of artificial intelligence say they hope to someday create a machine that can “think” for itself. The human brain is a magnificent instrument, capable of making computations that far outstrip the capacity of any currently existing machine . However, software engineers involved in AI development hope to eventually make a machine that can not only do everything a human can do, intellectually, but can also surpass it. Currently, the applications of AI in business and government largely amount to predictive algorithms , the kind that suggest your next song on Spotify or try to sell you a similar product to the one you bought on Amazon last week . However, AI evangelists believe that the technology will, eventually, be able to reason and make decisions that are much more complicated. This is where ML and DL come in. Machine learning (or ML) is a broad category of artificial intelligence that refers to the process by which software programs are “taught” how to make predictions or “decisions.” One IBM engineer, Jeff Crume, explains machine learning as a “very sophisticated form of statistical analysis.” According to Crume, this analysis allows machines to make “predictions or decisions based on data.” The more information that is fed “into the system, the more it’s able to give us accurate predictions,” he says. Unlike general programming where a machine is engineered to complete a very specific task , machine learning revolves around training an algorithm to identify patterns in data by itself. As previously stated, machine learning encompasses a broad variety of activities. Deep learning is machine learning. It is one of those previously mentioned sub-categories of machine learning that, like other forms of ML, focuses on teaching AI to “think.” Unlike some other forms of machine learning, DL seeks to allow algorithms to do much of their work. DL is fueled by mathematical models known as artificial neural networks (ANNs). These networks seek to emulate the processes that naturally occur within the human brain—things like decision-making and pattern identification. One of the biggest differences between deep learning and other forms of machine learning is the level of “supervision” that a machine is provided. In less complicated forms of ML, the computer is likely engaged in supervised learning —a process whereby a human helps the machine recognize patterns in labeled, structured data, and thereby improve its ability to carry out predictive analysis. Machine learning relies on huge amounts of “training data.” Such data is often compiled by humans via data labeling (many of those humans are not paid very well ). Through this process, a training dataset is built, which can then be fed into the AI algorithm and used to teach it to identify patterns. For instance, if a company was training an algorithm to recognize a specific brand of car in photos , it would feed the algorithm huge tranches of photos of that car model that had been manually labeled by human staff. A “testing dataset” is also created to measure the accuracy of the machine’s predictive powers, once it has been trained. When it comes to DL, meanwhile, a machine engages in a process called “unsupervised learning .” Unsupervised learning involves a machine using its neural network to identify patterns in what is called unstructured or “raw” data —which is data that hasn’t yet been labeled or organized into a database. Companies can use automated algorithms to sift through swaths of unorganized data and thereby avoid large amounts of human labor. ANNs are made up of what are called “nodes.” According to MIT , one ANN can have “thousands or even millions” of nodes. These nodes can be a little bit complicated but the shorthand explanation is that they—like the nodes in the human brain—relay and process information. In a neural network, nodes are arranged in an organized form that is referred to as “layers.” Thus, “deep” learning networks involve multiple layers of nodes. Information moves through the network and interacts with its various environs, which contributes to the machine’s decision-making process when subjected to a human prompt. Another key concept in ANNs is the “weight,” which one commentator compares to the synapses in a human brain. Weights, which are just numerical values, are distributed throughout an AI’s neural network and help determine the ultimate outcome of that AI system’s final output. Weights are informational inputs that help calibrate a neural network so that it can make decisions. MIT’s deep dive on neural networks explains it thusly: To each of its incoming connections, a node will assign a number known as a “weight.” When the network is active, the node receives a different data item — a different number — over each of its connections and multiplies it by the associated weight. It then adds the resulting products together, yielding a single number. If that number is below a threshold value, the node passes no data to the next layer. If the number exceeds the threshold value, the node “fires,” which in today’s neural nets generally means sending the number — the sum of the weighted inputs — along all its outgoing connections. In short: neural networks are structured to help an algorithm come to its own conclusions about data that has been fed to it. Based on its programming, the algorithm can identify helpful connections in large tranches of data, helping humans to draw their own conclusions based on its analysis. Machine and deep learning help train machines to carry out predictive and interpretive activities that were previously only the domain of humans. This can have a lot of upsides but the obvious downside is that these machines can (and, let’s be honest, will) inevitably be used for nefarious, not just helpful, stuff—things like government and private surveillance systems, and the continued automation of military and defense activity. But, they’re also, obviously, useful for consumer suggestions or coding and, at their best, medical and health research. Like any other tool, whether artificial intelligence has a good or bad impact on the world largely depends on who is using it."

    "article_content": "Neuralink, the Elon Musk-funded neuroscience startup, has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to implant its next patient with its experimental brain chip. This next operation will seek to fix certain issues that occurred following its first implantation operation. Neuralink previously implanted its experimental brain-computer interface chip in a paraplegic man, Noland Arbaugh, in an operation that was publicly announced this past January. Arbaugh’s identity was revealed during a livestream interview in March, during which the patient demonstrated some of the abilities the chip had given him, including the chance to play computer chess with his mind. It was recently revealed, however, that Arbaugh’s chip had malfunctioned and, for a period of time, experienced data leakage. The company has now received federal approval to continue implanting patients with its chip, with the promise that it will work out the kinks that caused problems with Arbaugh’s chip, the Wall Street Journal originally reported . Arbaugh’s chip malfunctioned because some of the tiny wires attached to the chip came loose and stopped channeling signals from his brain to the company’s servers. In its next operation, Neuralink plans to embed these tiny wires deeper into the next patient’s brain. A source told the newspaper that the company wants to implant as many as 10 additional people with its chip by the end of this year. Arbaugh recently opened up about his experience with the company in a series of press interviews. During a conversation with Bloomberg , Arbaugh explained the disappointment he felt when the chip began malfunctioning: “I started losing control of the cursor. I thought they’d made some changes and that was the reason...But then they told me that the threads were getting pulled out of my brain. At first, they didn’t know how serious it would be or a ton about it...It was really hard to hear. I thought I’d gotten to use it for maybe a month, and then my journey was coming to an end. I thought they would just keep collecting some data but that they were really going to move on to the next person. I cried a little bit.” However, Arbaugh says that updates to the chip’s software have allowed him to regain many of the abilities that he previously had and that he is still very supportive of Neuralink and what it’s done for him. To implant Neuralink’s chip, a human surgeon must cut a small hole into the patient’s skull, after which a 7-foot-tall robot dubbed “R1\" sutures the implant’s electrified wires directly into the brain. This hardware then rests in the portion of the patient’s skull that was removed, right below the scalp, while its tiny wires carry data back and forth between the brain and the startup’s servers. The company previously tested its chips on animals, sometimes to disastrous effect. A large number of the company’s animal test subjects had to be euthanized and some died quite horribly, according to a lawsuit from a physicians group . Gizmodo reached out to Neuralink for more details about its plans for the future and will update this story if it responds."

    "article_content": "Rejoice New Yorkers. The Portal is back. The large webcam-like contraption that looks like the stargate from Stargate , and livestreams constantly between the cities of New York and Dublin has been captivating the hearts and minds of people across the transatlantic. Well, maybe “captivating” is a bit strong. “Mildly amusing” or “pleasantly diverting” might be more apt descriptors. The project, which was created by a Lithuanian artist, Benediktas Gylys, with help from a small team, has reportedly drawn tens of thousands of visitors since it went up about a week ago. Popular as it is, however, the digital-physical interface was briefly deactivated last week, after a number of incidents in which people got just a little too rowdy with the weird art installation. In one instance, an OnlyFans creator lifted up her shirt and flashed a gawking crowd of Dubliners . There have also apparently been instances of “mooning,” cursing, and people sharing garish content with onlookers via their phones—stuff like videos of 9/11 and porn. Amidst all the shenanigans, the Dublin City Council announced last week that it would be temporarily shutting down the interface until a solution to the “inappropriate” behavior could be conjured. Now, less than a week later, the portal is back, and New Yorkers and Dubliners are free, once again, to stare at each other endlessly through the goofy art installation’s futuristic surface. However, there are some new time limitations on when people can use the portal, the Dublin City Council has announced . “The Portal will have specific hours of operation for the coming weeks with the livestream running daily from 6:00 AM to 4:00 PM in New York City and 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM in Dublin,” the council said, in a newly published statement. Portals.org, the organization behind the project, has also instituted new safeguards to make sure nobody steps on or obscures the camera attached to it. A newly implemented “proximity-based solution” will now blur the portal’s surface if anyone attempts to obscure the camera, the Dublin City Council said. My guess? The shenanigans that initially got the portal deactivated will continue. It’s only human nature to want to take something like this and screw with it. The creators of the project should give up on trying to moderate what people do and just accept that some percentage of the people who happen across the project are going to use it to titillate, annoy, and/or otherwise fuck with the people standing on the other side of it. The “hall monitor” approach is doomed to fail. Embrace the debauchery and weirdness now."

    "article_content": "It’s very possible we’ll know more about UFOs soon. Due to a stipulation inside the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act , the federal government is now required to share any and all internal reports on the subject of unidentified flying objects with the National Archives, which will then (eventually) share those reports with the public. The law in question will create an ‘‘Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Records Collection” that will ostensibly include any and all historical records that exist about the UFO subject. According to the National Archives, the new law requires that , by October 20, 2024, “each federal agency review, identify, and organize each Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) record in its custody for disclosure to the public and transmission to the National Archives.” Those records are defined, quite broadly, as any and all copies of “Government, Government-provided, or Government-funded records relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena, technologies of unknown origin, and non-human intelligence (or equivalent subjects by any other name with the specific and sole exclusion of temporarily non-attributed objects).” Relevantly, agencies must also turn over a host of metadata about each document, including the date that it was created, the agency and/or office that created it, and the security classification it falls under, among other data points. Does this mean that the truth that was out there will soon be on display in the halls of our nation’s historical preservation agency? Well, maybe. Probably not. Actually, it seems almost certain that whatever is about to come out will be slightly disappointing to the UFO community’s most fervent true believers. I have previously written about the labyrinthian topic of UFOs, and how, despite ongoing expectations of “disclosure,” the government has never revealed much about those mysterious lights in the sky—and there may not be a whole lot to know. It’s possible that this legislative push for transparency could force the government’s hand, though, as some have noted , it’s not clear what mechanisms will be available to force particularly secretive government agencies to comply with the new regulation. God knows the national security state knows how to keep a secret."

    "article_content": "Despite the fact that they’re created by humans, large language models are still quite mysterious. The high-octane algorithms that power our current artificial intelligence boom have a way of doing things that aren’t outwardly explicable to the people observing them. This is why AI has largely been dubbed a “black box,” a phenomenon that isn’t easily comprehended. Newly published research from Anthropic, one of the top companies in the AI industry, attempts to shed some light on the more confounding aspects of AI’s algorithmic behavior. On Tuesday, Anthropic published a research paper designed to explain why its AI chatbot, Claude, chooses to generate content about certain subjects over others. AI systems are set up in a rough approximation of the human brain—layered neural networks that intake and process information and then make “decisions” or predictions based on that information. Such systems are “trained” on large subsets of data, which allows them to make algorithmic connections. When AI systems output data based on their training, however, human observers don’t always know how the algorithm arrived at that output. This mystery has given rise to the field of AI “interpretation ,” where researchers attempt to trace the path of the machine’s decision-making so they can understand its output. In the field of AI interpretation, a “feature” refers to a pattern of activated “neurons” within a neural net—effectively a concept that the algorithm may refer back to. The more “features” within a neural net that researchers can understand, the more they can understand how certain inputs trigger the net to affect certain outputs. In a memo on its findings, Anthropic researchers explain how they used a process known as “dictionary learning” to decipher what parts of Claude’s neural network mapped to specific concepts. Using this method, researchers say they were able to “begin to understand model behavior by seeing which features respond to a particular input, thus giving us insight into the model’s ‘reasoning’ for how it arrived at a given response.” In an interview with Anthropic’s research team conducted by Wired’s Steven Levy , staffers explained what it was like to decipher how Claude’s “brain” works. Once they had figured out how to decrypt one feature, it led to others: One feature that stuck out to them was associated with the Golden Gate Bridge. They mapped out the set of neurons that, when fired together, indicated that Claude was “thinking” about the massive structure that links San Francisco to Marin County. What’s more, when similar sets of neurons fired, they evoked subjects that were Golden Gate Bridge-adjacent: Alcatraz, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and the Hitchcock movie Vertigo , which was set in San Francisco. All told the team identified millions of features—a sort of Rosetta Stone to decode Claude’s neural net. It should be noted that Anthropic, like other for-profit companies, could have certain, business-related motivations for writing and publishing its research in the way that it has. That said, the team’s paper is public , which means that you can go read it for yourself and make your own conclusions about their findings and methodologies."

    "article_content": "Celebrities and billionaires have long complained that it’s way too easy for random people on the internet to monitor how much fuel they waste as they flit through the skies via their private jets. Well, it appears that our government’s legislators have heard these complaints and, unlike when the rest of us whine about stuff, actually done something. An amendment in the Federal Aviation Administration re-authorization bill that was passed last week will allow private aircraft owners to anonymize their registration information. President Joe Biden signed the FAA bill into law on May 16th, after it passed in the Senate 88-4 and the House 387 to 26. Until now, jet tracking has been made possible because private plane owners are forced to register aircraft ownership information with the FAA civil registry. This registry has been public until now, allowing for proprietary data points to be combined with open radar mapping to understand where and when certain planes were traveling. It’s through this public information that online enthusiasts have been able to track the jet activity of America’s 1 percent. The Warzone originally reported that the new FAA reauthorization bill, which was introduced last June, will effectively make it impossible (or, at the very least, very, very difficult) to track the jet activity of the well-to-do. The law will allow private aircraft owners to request that the government hide the personally identifying information associated with their planes. That’s a bummer, since in an age of environmental concerns , it’s been helpful to know which members of America’s gilded class are spewing the most jet fuel into the atmosphere. It’s not as if America’s rich and famous haven’t been lobbying for this to happen, either. Elon Musk famously threatened to sue Jack Sweeney, an undergraduate at the University of Central Florida, after the student made a Twitter account that tracked the billionaire’s private jet activity. After Musk bought Twitter in 2022, he shadowbanned Sweeney before fully banning him from the platform. Sweeney has since been allowed back on X . Taylor Swift, meanwhile, has been dogged by complaints about her incessant air travel, also largely thanks to Sweeney’s flight monitoring efforts. Sweeney recently compiled a video of Swift’s 2023 plane trips, the likes of which appeared to show that the pop star had flown 178,000 miles last year—roughly the equivalent of seven trips around the Earth. According to Sweeney, her jets emitted 1,200 tons of CO2, or 83 times the amount of the average American. A lawyer for Swift served Sweeney with a cease-and-desist order in February. Swift’s air travel habits have proven particularly troublesome for her, tarnishing a public image that has otherwise been tightly protected and controlled. A popular conspiracy theory has postulated that the pop star has intentionally seeded news stories—such as her attendance of a New York Jets game involving her beau Travis Kelce—purely in an effort to bury the keywords “Taylor Swift” and “jets” in Google’s search index. This same theory would also seem applicable to a viral infotainment story that recently made the rounds in which Kelce talked about “jet lag” and Swift uttered: “Jet lag is a choice.” Of course, it’s worth pointing out that, unlike someone like Musk, Swift actually had a pretty good reason to travel a lot last year: she was on tour . That said, it’s still a lot of CO2. Like, a lot a lot. I am ostensibly in favor of data privacy regulations, though it’s somewhat ridiculous (if predictable) that billionaires get this sort of data privacy amendment, while regular Americans get surveillance capitalism as usual."

    "article_content": "It’s become exceedingly difficult to get your dog on a commercial flight, which is why a new, luxurious, albeit quite expensive, chartered air service for pets may be quite appealing to some pooch owners. BARK, which is a company that primarily sells dog food and toys, has officially launched an air travel service for dogs, dubbed BARK Air . The company announced the service last month and is scheduled to launch its first flight Thursday, CBS reports . For a hefty price, pet owners can now book a ticket with their pet to one of several different destinations. The company operates its service through Talon Air, a private jet chartering company, and says that it takes the “white glove experience typical of a human’s first-class experience” and redirects “all that pampering to pooches.” “When we started BARK in 2011, we were on a mission to disrupt the dog space and create products designed for dogs and their humans,” said Matt Meeker, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer at BARK, in a recent press release . “We are excited to take the insights we’ve learned over the years to create an experience that is truly dog-first, which is drastically different from just accepting dogs – from the ground to the skies.” To advertise the supposed benefits of this service, BARK Air’s website features a truly hilarious video that feels like a mockup between an SNL skit and a David Lynch short. In it, we see images from a BARK-chartered flight: in one scene, a friendly, smiling stewardess serves a confused-looking dog a tennis shoe on a silver platter; in another scene, a dog sips sparkling water from a crystal chalice; in yet another scene, a dog gets its hair blow-dried by a professional hair stylist. Whether BARK flights truly involve that much pampering is unclear at this point. I’m sure we’ll find out soon. Unfortunately, the prices for this elite pet service will likely prove prohibitively expensive for most people. Currently, a one-way ticket for a dog-and-human combo has a pay floor of something like $6,000. The service also appears to have a pretty limited selection of locations to choose. You can select one of four destinations: London, Los Angeles, New York, or Paris. So, yeah, that’s not great. Suffice it to say, it’d be really nice if BARK’s prices came down and it diversified its list of destinations since it’s become exceedingly difficult to get your dog on a commercial plane in recent years. The pandemic spurred numerous airlines—including United and Delta—to temporarily halt their pet programs , and, since then, restrictions on animals have gotten exceedingly frustrating. We definitely need a cheap and easy pet travel option, although it’s unclear if BARK is it."

    "article_content": "Google recently rolled out AI-generated answers at the top of web searches in a controversial move that’s been widely panned. In fact, social media is filled with examples of completely idiotic answers that are now prominent in Google’s AI results. And some of them are pretty funny. One bizarre search circulating on social media involves figuring out a way to keep your cheese from sliding off your pizza . Most of the suggestions in the AI replies are normal, like telling the user to let the pizza cool down before eating it. But the top tip is very weird, as you can see below. The funniest part is that, if you think about it for even a second, adding glue would almost certainly not help the cheese stay on the pizza. But this answer was probably scraped from Reddit in what was presumably a joke comment made by user “fucksmith” 11 years ago. AI can definitely plagiarize, we’ll give it that. Another search that recently got attention on social media involves some presidential trivia that will surely be news to any historian. If you ask Google’s AI-powered search which U.S. president went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, it will answer that 13 presidents have done just that. The answer from Google’s AI will even claim those 13 presidents attained 59 different degrees in the course of their studies. And if you take a look at the years they supposedly attended the university, the vast majority are long after those presidents died. Did the nation’s 17th president, Andrew Johnson, earn 14 degrees between the years 1947 and 2012, despite dying in 1875? Unless there’s some kind of special zombie technology we’re not aware of, that seems very unlikely. For the record, the U.S. has never elected a president from Wisconsin, nor one who ever attended the UW-Madison. The Google AI appears to be scraping its answer from a light-hearted 2016 blog post written by the Alumni Association about various people who’ve graduated from Madison and share the name of a president. Another pattern that many users have noticed is Google’s AI thinks dogs are capable of extraordinary feats—like playing professional sports. When asked if a dog has ever played in the NHL, the summary cited a YouTube video, and spat out the following answer: In another instance, we branched out from sports and asked the search engine whether a dog had ever owned a hotel. The platform’s response was: To be clear, when asked whether a dog had ever owned a hotel, Google answered in the affirmative. It then cited two examples of hotel owners owning dogs and pointed to a 30-foot-tall statue of a beagle, as evidence. Other things we “learned” while interfacing with Google’s AI Summaries include that dogs can breakdance (they can’t) and that they often throw out the ceremonial first pitch at baseball games, including a dog who pitched at a Florida Marlins game (in reality, the dog fetched the ball after it was thrown). For its part, Google is defending the bad information as the result of people asking “uncommon” questions. But that raises seems like a very odd defense, if we’re being honest. Are you only supposed to ask Google the most banal and common questions to get reliable answers? “The examples we’ve seen are generally very uncommon queries, and aren’t representative of most people’s experiences,” a Google spokesperson told Gizmodo over email. “The vast majority of AI Overviews provide high quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web. We conducted extensive testing before launching this new experience, and will use these isolated examples as we continue to refine our systems overall.” Why are these responses happening? Simply put, these AI tools all got rolled out way before they should’ve been and every major tech firm is in an arms race to capture audience attention. AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT , Google’s Gemini , and now Google’s AI Search can all seem impressive because they’re mimicking normal human language. But the machines work as predictive text models, essentially functioning as a fancy autocomplete feature. They’ve all hoovered up enormous amounts of data and can rapidly put words together that sound convincing, perhaps even profound on occasion. But the machine doesn’t know what it’s saying. It has no ability to reason or apply logic like a human, one of the many reasons AI boosters are so excited about the prospect of artificial general intelligence (AGI). And that’s why Google might tell you to put glue on your pizza. It’s not even stupid. It’s not capable of being stupid. The people who design these systems call these hallucinations because that sounds much cooler than what’s actually happening. When humans lose touch with reality, they hallucinate. But your favorite AI chatbot isn’t hallucinating because it wasn’t capable of reasoning or logic in the first place. It’s just spewing out word vomit that’s less convincing than the language that impressed us all when we first experimented with tools like ChatGPT during its rollout in November 2022. And every tech company on the planet is chasing that initial high with their own half-baked products. But no one had enough time to accurately evaluate these tools after the initial dazzling display of ChatGPT and the hype has been relentless. The problem, of course, is that if you ask AI a question you don’t know the answer to, you have no way of trusting the answer without doing a bunch of extra fact-checking. And that defeats the purpose of why you were asking these supposedly smart machines in the first place. You wanted to get a reliable answer. Contacted for comment on all this, a Google Spokesperson told Gizmodo: The examples we’ve seen are generally very uncommon queries, and aren’t representative of most people’s experiences. The vast majority of AI Overviews provide high-quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web. We conducted extensive testing before launching this new experience and will use these isolated examples as we continue to refine our systems overall. That said, in the quest to test the AI system’s intelligence, we did authentically learn some new things. For instance, at one point, we asked Google whether a dog had ever flown a plane, expecting that the answer would be “no.” Lo and behold, Google’s AI summary provided a well-sourced answer. Yes, actually, dogs have flown planes before, and no, that is not an algorithmic hallucination: What’s been your experience with Google’s AI rollout in Search? Have you noticed anything odd or downright dangerous in the responses you’ve been getting? Let us know in the comments, and be sure to include any screenshots if you have them. These tools look like they’re here to stay, whether we like it or not."

    "article_content": "For years, Apple has tried to make privacy a core part of its brand . The keyword here is “tried,” since multiple investigations (including one from Gizmodo ) have shown that the company doesn’t always live up to its lofty privacy promises. As part of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference , Apple rolled out several new features that aim to offer enhanced digital protections for MacOS, iOS, and iPadOS users. One feature that is sure to be popular is a new widget that allows you to “lock” and/or hide mobile apps. Locking an app closes it off to outside inspection, and the only way to unlock it is via a person’s face ID. This feature also lets users hide apps, by concealing them within a hidden folder. Hidden apps can also be locked, making them basically impenetrable to the outside observer. This feature seems potentially useful but also sorta funny since it seems so intentionally designed to let users get away with shady stuff. Want to cheat on your wife? Hide Tinder using App Lock! Want to sell drugs but also maintain an air of respectability on your mobile screen? Try App Lock! It’s also worth noting that Android phones have already offered identical feature for years. The more technically impressive privacy feature that Apple rolled out Monday is related to its newly announced artificial intelligence system. Apple debuted Apple Intelligence (or AI) on Monday, a new generative AI suite that draws off the data on a user’s phone, tablet, or computer to offer automated assistance. However, the company has acknowledged the invasive potential of this technology, given that it relies on the totality of a user’s mobile digital activities to inform its automation. “You should not have to hand over all the details of your life to be warehoused and analyzed in someone’s AI cloud,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, during his presentation on the new system. Federighi claims that Apple’s new AI models offer “powerful privacy” by processing data “on-device,” meaning that it isn’t shared with Apple but, instead, is kept circulating on the user’s phone or computer. “A cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on-device processing, and many of the models that power it run entirely on device,” the company says . For more complicated, energy-intensive models that require more processing power, Apple says it offers something called Private Cloud Compute, which is a system that interacts with Apple’s cloud but does not store user data and protects data via cryptographic defenses. Impressively, Apple has said that it wants “independent experts” to inspect this new feature and ensure that it is providing the protections that they say it does. Since there’s a lot that’s still unknown about Private Cloud Compute and the other privacy features that Apple just debuted, outside inspection seems like a great idea."

    "article_content": "Japan has formed a task force to investigate UFOs after the country was dubbed a “hotspot” for strange aerial sightings by a Pentagon report published last year. CBS reports that the group in question, which is known officially as the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Clarification League for Security-Oriented National Security, recently began its work. It was announced back in May , and is composed of numerous high-ranking parliamentary officials, including former Japanese defense officials. The group doesn’t seem terribly preoccupied with finding evidence of aliens, however. CBS reports that officials tied to the group have said UFOs may, in fact, be “surveillance drones or weapons.” One prominent member of the group, Yoshiharu Asakawa, said that while UFOs have typically been viewed as “an occult matter,” there was the possibility that they were, in fact, “cutting-edge secret weapons or spying drones in disguise” that could “pose a significant threat to our nation’s security,” CBS reports. Japan was identified as a hub for unexplained aerial activity in a report issued last year by the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), a little-known office of the U.S. Defense Department. Since then, the country has become increasingly interested in investigating the phenomenon. Japan’s efforts mirror similar efforts made by the U.S. and other Western countries in recent years. Last summer, the U.S. Congress notably held a public hearing on UFOs, during which multiple former government officials made claims of a government cover-up. A newly passed law, meanwhile will force the U.S. National Archives to collect any and all government documents related to UFOs and publish them for public inspection. I wish the Japanese luck, though it’s worth noting that the UFO topic has been around for ages and people have been trying to get to the bottom of it for just as long. It’s hard to believe that anyone’s going to make any serious headway now."

    "article_content": "If you own a Pixel , make sure it’s up to date right now. Google just quietly announced patches for as many as 50 different software vulnerabilities in its Pixel line, many of which are listed as being “critical” or “high” in severity. The company said that there are indications that at least one of the bugs “may be under limited, targeted exploitation.” The software flaws are in various different software and firmware components of the phone. The high-severity vulnerability that is thought to have seen exploitation is listed as CVE-2024-32896, which is said to be a privilege elevation flaw—meaning it could allow a hacker to penetrate deeper into a device’s system. Forbes writes that while the issues raised by the bugs are “unlikely to open the door to a remote attack on their own,” they “could potentially be leveraged in a chain attack, linked with other exploits to destabilize or exfiltrate sensitive data and credentials.” Information about the full list of bugs can be read on Android’s Pixel update bulletin webpage . “All supported Google devices will receive an update to the 2024-06-05 patch level. We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices,” the company said. Gizmodo reached out to Google for more details about the vulnerabilities and will update this story if it responds. Some bugs are obviously worse than others, although this many bugs on the same device make it critical that users make sure that their software is up to date and protected. A list of supported Pixel devices can be found on Google’s website. To install the patches for your Pixel, make sure to go to Settings > Security & Privacy > System & Updates > Security Update , and then hit Install . After that, restart your phone, which will ensure that the updates are complete."

    "title": "Apple’s AI Cloud System Makes Big Privacy Promises, but Can It Keep Them?",

    "article_content": "Apple’s new Apple Intelligence system is designed to infuse generative AI into the core of iOS. The system offers users a host of new services , including text and image generation as well as organizational and scheduling features. Yet while the system provides impressive new capabilities, it also brings complications. For one thing, the AI system relies on a huge amount of iPhone users’ data, presenting potential privacy risks. At the same time, the AI system’s substantial need for increased computational power means that Apple will have to rely increasingly on its cloud system to fulfill users’ requests. Apple has historically offered iPhone customers unparalleled privacy; it’s a big part of the company’s brand , after all. Part of those privacy assurances has been the option to choose when mobile data is stored locally and when it’s stored in the cloud. While an increased reliance on the cloud might ring some privacy alarm bells, Apple has anticipated these concerns and created a startling new system that it calls its Private Cloud Compute, or PCC . This is really a cloud security system designed to keep users’ data away from prying eyes while it’s being used to help fulfill AI-related requests. On paper, Apple’s new privacy system sounds really impressive. The company claims to have created “the most advanced security architecture ever deployed for cloud AI compute at scale.” But what looks like a massive achievement on paper could ultimately cause broader issues for user privacy down the road. And it’s unclear, at least at this juncture, whether Apple will be able to live up to its lofty promises. In many ways, cloud systems are just giant databases. If a bad actor gets into that system/database, they can look at the data contained within. However, Apple’s Private Cloud Compute (PCC) brings a number of unique safeguards that are designed to prevent that kind of access. Apple says it has implemented its security system at both the software and hardware levels. The company created custom servers that will house the new cloud system, and those servers go through a rigorous process of screening during manufacturing to ensure they are secure. “We inventory and perform high-resolution imaging of the components of the PCC node,” the company claims. The servers are also being outfitted with physical security mechanisms such as a tamper-proof seal. iPhone users’ devices can only connect to servers that have been certified as part of the protected system, and those connections are end-to-end encrypted, meaning that the data being transmitted is pretty much untouchable while in transit. Once the data reaches Apple’s servers, there are more protections to ensure that it stays private. Apple says its cloud is leveraging stateless computing to create a system where user data isn’t retained past the point at which it is used to fulfill an AI service request. So, according to Apple, your data won’t have a significant lifespan in its system. The data will travel from your phone to the cloud, interact with Apple’s high-octane AI algorithms—thus fulfilling whatever random question or request you’ve submitted (“draw me a picture of the Eiffel Tower on Mars”)—and then the data (again, according to Apple) will be deleted. Apple has instituted an array of other security and privacy protections that can be read about in more detail on the company’s blog . These defenses, while diverse, all seem designed to do one thing: prevent any breach of the company’s new cloud system. Companies make big cybersecurity promises all the time and it’s usually impossible to verify whether they’re telling the truth or not. FTX, the failed crypto exchange, once claimed it kept users’ digital assets in air-gapped servers. Later investigation showed that was pure bullshit . But Apple is different, of course. To prove to outside observers that it’s really securing its cloud, the company says it will launch something called a “transparency log” that involves full production software images (basically copies of the code being used by the system). It plans to publish these logs regularly so that outside researchers can verify that the cloud is operating just as Apple says. Apple’s new privacy system has notably polarized the tech community. While the sizable effort and unparalleled transparency that characterize the project have impressed many, some are wary of the broader impacts it may have on mobile privacy in general. Most notably—aka loudly—Elon Musk immediately began proclaiming that Apple had betrayed its customers. Simon Willison, a web developer and programmer, told Gizmodo that the “scale of ambition” of the new cloud system impressed him. “They are addressing multiple extremely hard problems in the field of privacy engineering, all at once,” he said. “The most impressive part I think is the auditability—the bit where they will publish images for review in a transparency log which devices can use to ensure they are only talking to a server running software that has been made public. Apple employs some of the best privacy engineers in the business, but even by their standards this is a formidable piece of work.” But not everybody is so enthused. Matthew Green, a cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins University, expressed skepticism about Apple’s new system and the promises that went along with it. “I don’t love it,” said Green with a sigh. “My big concern is that it’s going to centralize a lot more user data in a data center, whereas right now most of that is on people’s actual phones.” Historically, Apple has made local data storage a mainstay of its mobile design, because cloud systems are known for their privacy deficiencies. “Cloud servers are not secure, so Apple has always had this approach,” Green said. “The problem is that, with all this AI stuff that’s going on, Apple’s internal chips are not powerful enough to do the stuff that they want it to do. So they need to send the data to servers and they’re trying to build these super protected servers that nobody can hack into.” He understands why Apple is making this move, but doesn’t necessarily agree with it, since it means a higher reliance on the cloud. Green says Apple also hasn’t made it clear whether it will explain to users what data remains local and what data will be shared with the cloud. This means that users may not know what data is being exported from their phones. At the same time, Apple hasn’t made it clear whether iPhone users will be able to opt out of the new PCC system. If users are forced to share a certain percentage of their data with Apple’s cloud, it may signal less autonomy for the average user, not more. Gizmodo reached out to Apple for clarification on both of these points and will update this story if the company responds. To Green, Apple’s new PCC system signals a shift in the phone industry to a more cloud-reliant posture. This could lead to a less secure privacy environment overall, he says. “I have very mixed feelings about it,” Green said. “I think enough companies are going to be deploying very sophisticated AI [to the point] where no company is going to want to be left behind. I think consumers will probably punish companies that don’t have great AI features.”"

    "article_content": "If you have really basic questions about your new AirPods , this guide will help you with everything from connecting them to cleaning them. It also includes some tips for improving sound and customizing controls—that will make the most out of your new Apple earbuds. 2 / 9 To pair your AirPods with your iPhone for the first time, open the charging case with your AirPods inside and hold it next to your iPhone. You’ll see a pairing animation pop up on your iPhone. Tap Connect. If you’re signed in to iCloud on a device and paired your AirPods with it once, your AirPods will automatically pair with all of your other devices that are signed in to the same iCloud with the same Apple ID. So, this isn’t something you’re going to have to do for each of your Apple devices. 3 / 9 A quick way to do this is by checking the LED on the charging case. Green indicates fully charged, and amber means less than one full charge remains. If your AirPods are in the charging case and the lid is open, the light shows the battery status of your AirPods. When your AirPods aren’t in your case, the light shows the status of your case. You can also check the battery status of your AirPods on your iPhone. Open the lid of your charging case with your AirPods inside and hold the case close to your iPhone. The battery status of your AirPods will show up on your phone in a few seconds. 4 / 9 You can see where exactly your AirPods (any model) are when you lose them, and if you own the AirPods Pro 2nd Gen, you can also locate their charging case. Just go to the Find My app on your iPhone and choose your AirPods from the list of connected devices . For situations where you lose a single bud (which happens far too often), you can separately click on left or right—whichever bud you lost. If you’re an AirPods Pro 2 owner, you can click on the charging case to locate that. Your Find My app can help you in two ways. It will locate your AirPods on a map, which would be helpful if they’re far from where you are. The app also offers a Play Sound option under the map that you can tap to make your buds or case ring out loud. This helps when you’re within hearing distance of them and can follow the sound. 5 / 9 If you go into Settings > Accessibility > Audio & Visual > Headphone Accommodations , you can tweak your music according to your preferences. Start by turning on the toggle switch for Headphone Accommodations, then tap Custom Audio Setup. You will first see the option to add your personal audiogram test results. These can be uploaded via the Camera, Photos, or Files app. If you’re not interested, hit Don’t Use Audiogram on the Add an Audiogram screen. Doing that will prompt you to go to the next step of the process. Here, you’ll listen to music samples and pick the one you like best. You’ll be asked to repeat the test with different samples. This part determines what frequencies you like emphasized and the level of detail you want in your music. Once you’re done, you can pick an automatic setting from the options. These allow you to tune your audio for a specific quality (balanced tone, vocal range, or brightness) and pick how much (slight, moderate, or strong) you want to boost the soft sounds in your songs. 6 / 9 You don’t have to stick to your AirPods’ out-of-the-box touch settings. When pressed, you can change what they do by going into S ettings > Bluetooth Settings and tapping the little info icon next to your AirPods. Start by tapping Left and Right and choosing what action they will activate. Your two options are Noise Control and Siri. Then, navigate the Call Controls list to choose how to mute/unmute and end calls. You can pick from Press Once (single tap) or Press twice (double tap). The options here are pretty limited, but it’s still a helpful feature. 7 / 9 If your AirPods are acting up, and you’ve already tried turning them off and on again, you can reset them. This works for all generations of AirPods and AirPods Pro. Put the AirPods in their charging case, close the lid, and wait for 30 seconds. Then, open the lid and press and hold the setup/pairing button on the back of the case for around 15 seconds. The status light on the front of your case should flash amber and then turn white. This is how you’ll know you were successful at resetting. 8 / 9 To clean the charging case, use a soft, dry cloth. If you want, you can slightly dampen it with isopropyl alcohol. Be careful around the charging port, and ensure that it does not get any liquid inside it. Also, make sure it’s fully dry before you use it. If you see build-up inside the port, use a soft-bristled, dry brush to brush it off gently. To clean the ear tips of your AirPods, pull them off from the buds and rinse them in clean water. Ensure the water doesn’t have soap or a household cleaner mixed in it. Then, dry them using a clean, lint-free cloth. Be careful to dry them before you attach them to your AirPods. If you wish to specifically clean the mic and speaker meshes, use a dry cotton swab. Two general things to keep in mind while cleaning your AirPods or the charging case are to 1) never run them under water and 2) never use sharp or abrasive materials to clean them. 9 / 9"

    "article_content": "I didn’t realize that Microsoft had pushed out the update that brought advertising to the Windows 11 Start menu until I started to read the news. I’ve had recommendations turned off this entire time. It turns out the same option hides the “curated” Microsoft Store apps currently populating on systems running the KB5036980 update. There are a few other components to this particular software update, but they’re minor. Widgets in the taskbar and on the lock screen have been improved and are no longer pixelated and fuzzy. Animated icons have also been added to the mix. I come from a time when Windows wasn’t inundated with advertising and suggestions. It feels like it was a long time ago because Microsoft’s been toying with advertising in the Start menu since Windows 10. I want to believe the company has caught on that plenty of users are on my wavelength. It put the details for turning off the Recommended section of the Start menu on the software update page, even bolding it. Go to Settings > Personalization > Start , or use the Start menu search bar to open the settings panel. Then, select the option to toggle off Show recommendations for tips, shortcuts, new apps, and more . This will turn off any extra content and curated app suggestions. You might also consider selecting the layout option for More Pins so there are more slots for quickly pinning the apps you want to access. As with everything in life, there are trade-offs to turning off the recommendations. The Start menu will function more like an app shelf—the equivalent to a bookshelf if you will—than an application drawer. You’ll need to curate apps you want to be pinned there, or it will render the overlay window useless beyond the search bar. Sadly, you can’t reclaim that part of the Start menu unless you try futzing with a third-party app like ExplorerPatcher , StartAllBack , or Start11 . Those are some apps I’ve seen curated and recommended in varying forums. The only one I’ve used is Stardock’s Start11, though I haven’t dabbled with it since I updated to Windows 11. Perhaps I should reconsider what a third-party Start menu could offer since Microsoft seems hellbent on serving those ads."

    "article_content": "I have always used Google Maps but never cared enough to look beyond the basic features. It wasn’t until today that I made an effort to explore the app and ended up going down a rabbit hole of all the cool things it’s capable of. You might already know some of these, but you might have missed a handful of interesting hidden features. Some of these are specific to car owners, some to folks who require accessible spaces, but most of the things on this list are features everyone could use to save time and energy. 2 / 9 Google Maps has a dedicated feature that shows you transit routes that are accessible via wheelchair. All you have to do is put your destination on the app, tap Directions, click on the transit icon, and then tap Options on the top right corner of the map. Under Route options, click on Wheelchair accessible and go back to the map . You’ll now see different transit routes based on accessibility. The Route options tab also offers other helpful stuff. You can choose from Best route, Fewest transfers, and Least walking based on your top priority. 3 / 9 You can go back in time on Google Maps to see what a place, street, or area was like years ago. Put the place you want to check out on the map and tap the Street View icon on the bottom-left of your screen. Once a street map of that place shows up, click anywhere on your screen and tap See more dates at the bottom. Pick any date and go as far back as you want. You can pan on your screen in any direction to take a good look at the area from every angle. 4 / 9 Google Maps will tell you what the parking scene is at the place you’re going to. Just put your destination on the map, click on the car icon, and you’ll see a P icon on the bar at the bottom. The icon will have either Limited, Medium, or Easy next to it. Easy or even Medium should be fine. But if it says Limited, you might want to plan in advance or pick another commute option. 5 / 9 Have you ever forgotten where you’ve parked? It’s happened to the best of us. Google Maps gets it, and they specifically have a feature for that. When you’ve parked, t ap your blue location circle on the map, and click on Save parking. Your location will be saved to a Saved parking list. To retrieve it later, tap the Search field at the top and click on Saved parking. 6 / 9 We often plan in advance by putting our destination on the map and seeing how long the commute is going to be. But it isn’t always possible to factor peak hours into consideration. I mean, I tell myself it’s going to be a lot busier at 6 PM, but I didn’t know there’s a fairly accurate tool for it. Put your destination on the map, and tap Directions. Click on Leave now and pick a time you want. You can use either the Leave tool to see when you’re going to reach if you leave at a specific time or the Arrive tool to see what time you need to leave if you wish to arrive at a certain time. 7 / 9 Having too much fun at a party but don’t want to miss the last train/bus back home either? This is the tool you’re going to use for that. Google Maps lets you look at when the last ride back home is. Put your destination in the Search bar on the map, tap Directions, and click on the transit icon. Then go to Leave now, and click Last. Click on the date for that day, and tap Done. You’ll see the latest possible transit options for that day. 8 / 9 Just like wheelchair-accessible routes, Google Maps also shows you fuel-efficient routes. It’s a setting that you’d need to turn on just once, and all your future routes will have a fuel efficiency filter applied to them. Head over to Settings on Google Maps, tap Navigation, and scroll down to Prefer fuel-efficient routes. Turn the toggle switch on. Then scroll down to Engine type and pick your engine out of Gas, Diesel, Electric, Hybrid. Google Maps will pick a fuel-efficient route for you based on your engine type. 9 / 9"

It’s not the smallest, it’s not the most powerful, but damn is it appealing. More than two years after the Deck’s original release , we now know the full extent of the console’s capabilities. After getting to know your Deck inside and out, it could easily become your favorite gaming device, bar none. I know it’s become that for me. The Deck is running a Linux distro that centers itself on Steam in particular, so it makes getting a few other game clients like Epic Games Store a bit more tricky. If you’re looking for other Windows-based gaming handhelds, there’s the still-popular ROG Ally or the perfunctory but still workable Lenovo Legion Go . Though, to be honest, until Microsoft finally releases a scaled-down version of its OS for this form factor, it might be better to stick with the still-buggy SteamOS. But you don’t have to feel stuck to Steam with your Deck. While we’ve done guides for consoles like the PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X , and Nintendo Switch , the Steam Deck is effectively a Linux-based PC running a special UI called SteamOS. If you can get it to run on a PC, you can pretty much get it working on a Steam Deck. Now, that comes with a fair bit of hassle as well. Your average user is more used to simply downloading the Netflix app to access their shows but not having to download a separate app to access cloud services through what’s ostensibly just a device for playing your Steam library on the go. But that open ecosystem has allowed for the Steam Deck, and by extension, its other handheld console contemporaries, to become one of the best platforms for game emulation, streaming from your PC or even another console. With two years under its belt and a refresh, thanks to the Steam Deck OLED, we’ve now seen far more of what the Deck is capable of, and it’s only going to get better as time goes on. A lot of the more complicated applications on the Steam Deck require you to access Desktop Mode. It’s actually very simple. Hit the Steam button on the Steam Deck, go down to Power, then choose Desktop Mode . This will bring you to a desktop that will look familiar to anybody who’s used a version of Linux before, but if you have any experience with Windows, it shouldn’t prove too difficult to unpack. The Steam Deck uses KDE Plasma, an open-source Linux distro, and it’s pretty simple to wrap your head around, so if you’re a complete newbie to this sort of environment, don’t sweat it. We’re here to get the most out of your deck, and soon enough, you’ll be running emulators and running non-Steam content with the rest of the “hardcore” users. This might be one of the least-known tricks you can do with your Steam Deck if you don’t want to go through the hassle of signing into Spotify or Apple Music through your deck. When you go into Desktop Mode, click the System Settings icon in the bottom right, search for Bluetooth, and then pair your phone with the Steam Deck. You may need to hang out on both devices’ Bluetooth screens to ensure they’re hooked up, but this should be a relatively painless process. Once that’s done, your Steam Deck should now play any of the audio coming from your phone. If it’s not currently working, you may need to set the default audio settings on your phone to make the Steam Deck the default speaker. Otherwise, you’ll be able to control your music and the in-game audio independently, or else hook your deck to a dock and use it as a small, if not terribly great, speaker if you want some ambient audio in a pinch. Want to change your Steam Deck’s brightness on the fly without clicking through any menus? Surprise, surprise, there’s a quick button shortcut for that. Hit the Steam button and move the left joystick up or down. There’s a bunch more, and some of them can be pretty handy. When you’re in Game Mode, hold the Steam button down for a second, and you’ll see the full list of shortcuts available. Some of these are extra useful, such as Steam + B to force quit a game. If you ever need to bring up the on-Deck keyboard, simply hold down the Steam + X, and you’ll be able to type away. If you’re already used to hitting F12 to screenshot on your regular Steam client, you should also know there’s an easy way of screenshotting on your deck as well. Hold the Steam button and hit the R1 bumper; the screenshots will show up in your albums under the Media tab for you to peruse. As for screen recording, it’s currently not incorporated directly into Steam Deck itself, even though other major systems like the PS5 and Xbox have features that let users record footage even after they’ve already done it. Maybe that’s too much for the small Deck to handle, but it’s a grave omission for today’s expectations for an all-in-one gaming device. Some folks have found success with a program called Decky Loader and another app called Decky Recorder. It’s a less-than-ideal situation, but if you’re desperate to record natively on your deck, that might be the best route. The freeware Decky Loader app for Steam Deck offers a heap of extra capabilities you don’t have based in the Deck’s Game Mode. All you have to do is download the file in Desktop Mode from any browser, then open it up in your files and hit Execute . This will take you to an installation screen where all you have to do is follow the prompts, and then you should be all set. Once you go back to Game Mode, hit the button on the Deck with the three dots, then scroll down to the Decky menu. Hit the button on the top right that looks like a market stall, and you’ll be brought to a new UI where you can easily download a host of neat customization plugins you can install. There’s a plugin that makes it easier to include custom animations on your deck and replace Steam UI sound effects. There’s another plugin to access your RetroAchievements from EmuDeck that’s also plenty of fun if you want to turn your Deck into an emulation beast. Select which plugins work best for you, then hit Install. We recommend some plugins like vibrantDeck to adjust color settings, Discord Status to share your status with friends on Discord, or perhaps Animation Changer if you want to truly customize what plays when you’re browsing your Deck’s menus. The Steam Deck might not be the most powerful gaming handheld out there, but it also might be the easiest to use for streaming from your other gaming devices, whether it’s a PC or a console. Enabling remote play from your PC means you can get better graphics output than what the Steam Deck can natively handle, so if you’re playing at home and your computer’s on, you can enjoy your gaming experience right from the couch. Going through Steam is–obviously–going to be your easiest option here. First, on your PC, make sure the streaming setting is enabled by going to your Steam app, hitting the Steam button up top, and then going to Settings . Under the Remote Play section, make sure Remote Play is enabled and Enable Advanced Host Options is also toggled on. Make sure Change desktop resolution to match streaming client is also clicked on. Then, on your Steam Deck, you’ll need to click on the game you want to stream, hit the arrow next to the play button, and then select the device you want to stream from. Hit Stream, and it should launch the game on the computer while streaming to your Deck. If you’re one of those folks who has their games split between multiple clients, this is your best option for getting these to work on a Steam Deck. Epic Games Store currently doesn’t support Linux, so if you want everything in one place, it’s far easier to use the Heroic Launcher. The app is essentially a third-party multimodal launcher that you can log into your Epic Games, GOG, and Amazon to access some of your titles. We should note that you don’t need Heroic or any other separate launcher to add non-Steam games to the Steam Deck, but we found it a bit easier overall. You’ll probably want to have a keyboard and mouse plugged in to make this process smooth. First, go to the Discover app on the KDE Plasma taskbar. Then, search for Heroic Launcher, download it, and hit the launch button at the top. Once in, choose Log in along the left side column and sign into your accounts. To make things easier, you’ll want to be able to access these non-Steam games from your main account. So, while you’re in Desktop Mode, open up the Steam client and look up on the top row where it says Games . Click that, then hit Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library. Scroll until you see the Heroic Games Launcher. Click that, then hit Add Selected Programs . You should now have access to some of your non-Steam games, though you might encounter other runtime problems. First, you will be asked to switch to a version of the proton that requires you to install Visual C++ libraries. In that case, you’ll need to download them and extract them into whatever folder through desktop mode. You’ll want to switch the game .exe to “vcredist2015_2017_2019_2022_x64.exe,” then run it, install it, then go back to the game in Heroic, return the game to its normal .exe, and play it again (remember to offer props to the Redditors who discovered this fix). Now that we’re pretty well-versed in Steam Deck’s desktop mode, we can start thinking about running emulators. For this, we’ll want to first look at EmuDeck . This is truly an amazing program that can do pretty much everything you would want it to. It’s essentially one big platform capable of running all the biggest emulators out there. They have their own dedicated video tutorial for downloading it, which runs you through the basics of getting the program on your device. Suffice it to say that you’ll want to be in Desktop Mode before downloading EmuDeck and copying it over to your desktop from your downloads folder. Click on the file, hit Execute, and follow the instructions. You can do a quick install, which will give you all the major emulators on the platform, or do a custom install, where you can choose and select specific button layouts, save states, aspect ratios, and more. Once you’re installed the program and put your ROMs into the correct folder for the system you’re trying to emulate, you should be able to access EmuDeck from your regular Game Mode UI under Collections. The next step is to find some ROMs to emulate, but since that’s a far more tricky legal subject, we’ll leave it up to you to find those. If you need a bit more help, check out our guides on PC game emulation and iOS game emulation . Do you like EmuDeck? Good, cause it gets even better. You don’t have to go through the rigamarole of going into a browser to watch your Netflix. Instead, you can have the app right at your fingertips from when you first boot up the console. Go into Browser Mode, then hop into EmuDeck after you’ve installed it. On the left-hand column, slide down until you see Cloud Services. Click on that, and then select Manage Cloud Services and hit OK. From here, select all the streaming services that apply to you. The list includes the gamut of cloud gaming and streaming services. Paramount+ still doesn’t work with Linux, and you might be restricted from watching 4K content on Netflix. It’s not like that’s really going to matter if you’re watching on the small Deck screen, but keep it in mind. Once you hit OK , you’ll get a pop-up telling you to run Steam ROM Manager. Quit out of this screen and EmuDeck, then head over to your SteamROMManager app (if it’s not on your desktop, search for it after you click on the Steam Deck icon on the bottom left). Once in the app, go to Add Games, then hit Parse . This will show you your ROMS and front-end emulators currently installed with Steam. Search for Cloud Services under the Category drop-down menu if the list is too much. After you find the right streaming services, you can hit Add to Steam . Go back into Game Mode, and under Collections, you should find your streaming apps. The UI isn’t perfect since it requires you to use the trackpads or sticks to move a mouse cursor, but it’s perfectly workable, and you should now have easy access to your shows when you open up your Deck. Your eyes are important, and you should help them by scheduling your Night Mode on your deck. Under Settings and Display , there’s an option to schedule a Night Mode for whenever you end up plugging away at your Deck after dark. Scroll down the options, and you can even expand it to set a custom tint for your deck at night, going so far as to mess with the hue and saturation. It’s great the Deck offers this amount of customization at base, though you may also want to look into a few plugins in Decky Loader that could make your experience in Game Mode a bit more nuanced. If you’re a PS5 player, you really, really don’t need a PlayStation Portal if you already have a Steam Deck or really any other handheld console. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X can indeed stream to your Steam Deck, though you’ll need a bit of extra software. Again, this can get pretty involved, so strap in. First, go into Desktop Mode and use the Discover bar to search for Chiaki , or more specifically, Chiaki4Deck, an open-source software to connect to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 remote play. You might read online about other guides telling you to put in lines to the “Kommand” console, but with Chiaki4Deck you can also use this link while on the browser of your Deck, which should help you access your PSN account through Chiaki by following the instructions. This will run the script for you, and you will be prompted to enter the login credentials necessary to access the PS5 remote play. You’ll also want to make sure your PS5 has all its Remote Link settings enabled. Go to Settings , System , then Remote Play . Ensure all but the remote start with Spotify options are turned on, and you should be ready. You’ll need your PS5 on while you start this process, as you’ll need a special pin from the system to link your Deck to your PlayStation. After this is set, running Chiaki may take a few tries to get it working correctly. Once this is all settled, the Steam Deck should work as a streaming device as long as you’re connected to the same network. You can set up Chiaki to launch from Game Mode by going into Steam on Browser Mode, then hitting Games , Add non-Steam Game, and selecting Chiaki. Ever wonder what the hell all those Steam Points are used for? No? Unfortunately, you can’t use them to buy games, but if you’re like me and haven’t used any in years, you’ll have enough to customize your Steam account with a host of unique avatars and backgrounds. But for Deck users in particular, there’s a special shop where you can download a host of custom startup animations. You might not know about this because the Points Shop is strangely difficult to access. You first need to go up to your user icon in the top corner of the page, then go to View Profile and hit the button to Edit Profile. Scroll down on the left until you see the Points Shop . You can also find it from Settings, under Customization, and at the bottom where it says Find More Startup Movies . It’s also under Keyboard, where it says Find More Keyboard Themes . From there, you can see a whole host of different items on sale that you can use to buy points. These include profiles, backgrounds, animated stickers, badges, and more. In particular, for Steam Deck, you’ll find special keyboard colors and custom animations you’ll see on startup. The Startup Movies section includes some cool gems inspired by games like Hades , Portal , or Dead Cells. There are more that are simply fun, like Deckfetti or Handmade. It’s a small thing, but many folks out there are not used to the A button being below the B button. The Nintendo Switch has it–well–switched, so some users would rather not have to get their thumbs used to a different control setup. You’ll find this option by hitting the Steam button, going down to Settings then looking under Controller . It’s a simple switch, but remember to change it back. You’ll have to use the ‘B’ button instead to select the toggle. By default, anybody who wants to use your Steam Deck needs to turn it on; then they’re good to go. But one of the first updates to come to the deck added an optional PIN system you can set in case you don’t want your cousins playing with your Deck. Hit the Steam button, then go to Settings . Under Security , you can create a lock screen when you wake up the system or when showing the login screen. It’s surprising not to see it on by default, which is why you’ve probably missed it all this time."

    "article_content": "Keeping track of medications is vital in most cases, but it can be hard to do without alarms and an extra nudge to make it a habit. I’ve personally had difficulty staying on schedule since I started taking daily medications decades ago. But these last few years, as more smartphones began to have the ability built-in, I finally found a groove. Most of that groove settled in when I shifted taking pills to first thing in the morning. The water and pills are both there for me to take as directed. But then come the smartphone helpers when I get downstairs. I walk to my office and mark down my medication in Samsung Health on my Pixel 8 and Apple Health , which I have set up on an iPhone 15 Pro Max review unit. That’s when the day can officially get started. Samsung Health, in particular, offers a blaring alarm and lets you snooze for fifteen minutes at a time. It’s helpful when I have an off-schedule morning and need to take my pills a little later. If you have the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 paired with it, it’ll buzz the wrist, too. Apple’s Health app’s medication reminder doesn’t chase you quite as aggressively to take your pill, but it is excellent at helping you figure out what you can mix on those days you need an Advil or Tylenol to get by. You could use a third-party app to track your medication. But nothing beats integrated functionality. With Apple Health, there’s even Siri integration. It’s too bad Google Fit and Fitbit have yet to offer medication tracking and reminders. Apple has integrated the ability to track your medications into the Health app bundled on your iPhone. It’s one of the more user-friendly ways to track your pills. It’ll even tell you whether recreational drugs interfere with your daily prescription, though Apple emphasizes on its support page that it is “not a substitute for professional medical judgment.” In Apple Health, tap Browse at the bottom right and then tap Medications . Tap to add a medication, and then later, come to this same page to add a new prescription when it comes through. You can either identify the medication by name or use the camera. Then, follow the instructions to choose your dosage and set a schedule. If you are like me and you are likely to forget to take your pills, be sure to turn on Follow-Up Reminders in the notification settings. There’s also a button called Critical Alerts , which will push through any focus mode to remind you to take your meds. Google Fit, a universal app shipped on most Android devices, is often the default health offering. The app doesn’t yet support medication reminders, and users yearn for the feature in the Google support forums. Until then, there’s always the Samsung Health app. I began storing my data in this app when I switched to the Samsung wearable ecosystem for wellness tracking. I’ve kept it going because I like the breadth of features offered on Samsung Health compared to Google Fit or Fitbit , which pairs with the Pixel Watch . The only caveat is that you must log on with a Samsung account to sync data, which can be a chore if you’re not on a Samsung device. Samsung Health only started offering medication reminders late last year , but the feature is already pretty robust. It even lets you add “as needed” medication to indicate the days you take something for an acute ailment. Notifications can be set up for supplements. Like the Apple Health app, setup for medication reminders in Samsung Health is straightforward from the onboarding process. Just search for your medication, brand name or generic. Then, input how you take the drug, the dosage, and when the notification should pulse through. The schedule is the key to Samsung Health’s medication reminders. Once you set up that alarm, there’s no going back. At the same time every day, the Samsung Health app will pop up and take over your screen—no matter what you’re doing—to ask if you’ve taken your meds. You can swipe up the option that says you’ve taken it or select the option to snooze. Samsung Health will then circle back every 15 minutes. But if you snooze it too much, eventually, the reminder stops taking over your screen and camps out in your notification shade. I prefer this because then I can mark it as taken when I eventually get to it without launching an app. Medication reminders should be easy to mark off; this is the easiest for me. What are some ways you track your pills?"

    "article_content": "Android’s best new feature in years is Circle to Search . So it’s no wonder iPhone users are happy to learn there’s a way to replicate it. On X, formerly known as Twitter, Minsang Choi, the design manager for Google Lens, offered faithful Google users on the iPhone a tip for a Circle-to-Search-like feature. It’s not the exact mechanism on Android, where you hold down the Home button to take a snapshot of your screen and highlight what you want the search engine to fetch. However, it invokes Google Lens, which works like Circle to Search on the Android devices that support it . If you follow the instructions at 9to5Google , it’s pretty straightforward to set up. You’ll need the Google app on your iPhone and the Shortcuts app front and center. Then, click on this link on your iPhone to grab the shortcut. Once that’s in Shortcuts, you will want to head back into the iOS Settings app and set up the Accessibility setting. Under Accessibility , scroll to the Physical and Motor section and tap the Touch option. On the next page, scroll down and select Back Tap from the Touch menu at the bottom of the screen. Here, you can assign the Shortcut to a double or triple tap. I would suggest the latter since it’s easier to distinguish between three taps for a feature than two. On the last screen, scroll to the Shortcuts section and select the option to Search your screenshot . When it’s all configured, you should be able to triple-tap on the back of your device on any screen to activate the Shortcut. I tried it out on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with a video on TikTok, text on DuckDuckGo, and Stories on Instagram. TikTok let me select what I wanted to search for before it went off to return results. However, on Instagram and DuckDuckGo, the Shortcut immediately searched for whatever the main image was on screen without my being able to select it. The Apple Shortcut is not as fluid as using Circle to Search. Sometimes, you’ll have to return to the screen to reselect the elements you wanted Google to find. This can be incredibly tedious if you’re trying to select a specific line of text at a time. At least on Android, Circle to Search is more integrated, so you can interact with the screen without being precise. You can’t do that with the iPhone just yet. Note that this isn’t an end-all, be-all replacement for Circle to Search on iOS. But until Google actually brings it to the iPhone, there’s always this roundabout way to get easy access to the search engine you were going to query anyway."

    "article_content": "Google I/O 2024 is nearly here. If you’re a proud Green Bubble or curious about what’s next from the ecosystem, you’ll want to set aside some time for next week’s annual developer’s conference. It’s happening May 14-15, with a live-streamed keynote on May 14, 2024, at 10:00 A.M. PT / 1.:00 P.M. ET . This year, Google is hosting two days of sessions that will occur on-site at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View for in-person attendees. Then, Google will stream the sessions later in the week. In the last few years, the company hosted a hybrid model of the conference. But this year, it seems it’s returning to form in a smaller capacity. Most sessions will be catered to the developers on the ground at the conference and those attending virtually. But those sessions are also where you can learn more about what Google has planned for its search engine, mobile operating system, and, most importantly, AI. This one’s the easiest to do, and you don’t have to register for Google I/O if you want a summary of the announcements. You can watch the Google I/O 2024 keynote live on the main event page or directly on YouTube . If you plan on tuning in to any sessions after they become available, you must register for Google I/O to be reminded when they’re available. Registering for the online portion of the conference is free. Then, check back on Thursday, May 16 , when the in-person content is uploaded to the web. It will be available beginning at 8 A.M. PT/11 A.M. ET. What do we expect from the search giant at this year’s developer conference? We hope to hear more about Gemini’s goings-on and how Google will integrate it into its products. We also hope to hear more about what’s on the horizon for Pixel hardware beyond the brand-new Pixel 8a that was just announced. Read more about what’s on the docket for Google I/O 2024 ."

    "article_content": "The latest iPad Airs and iPad Pros breathed fresh life into Apple’s tablets just as they seemed to be getting stale. Love them or hate them , the new Pros and Airs are pretty damn powerful, with the M4-powered tablet being practically just as capable as the most recent baseline MacBooks , but with the extra benefit of a beautiful OLED touchscreen. Now’s the time to get even more intimate with all your iPad is capable of. If you are thinking of buying one of the new iPads , we have a beginner’s guide for you . If you want to know how to get the most out of the new Apple Pencil Pro, we have a separate review for that . But what if you’re truly trying to get the most out of your tablet? There are a few cool features and options that will make your app-based experience a little bit easier or, at the very least, a bit more interesting. For better or worse, iPadOS is its own unique specimen sitting in the center of Apple’s self-contained software terrarium. It exists somewhere between iPhone and Mac, though in its effort to be a jack of all trades, it loses out on some of the ease of iPhones and the versatility of Macs. You’ll notice the power of the new iPads when you run games or intensive apps but not so much during regular day-to-day usage. However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t a whole lot of interesting things you can still do with the Apple tablet, much of which has to do with the benefits of the latest version of iPadOS, 17.5. The new chip has more AI processing power under the hood, but there’s not much functionality to use that, at least not yet. We’re very interested in seeing what Apple has in store for WWDC , where we’ll likely catch the first hint of iPadOS 18. 2 / 11 First off, yes, this is a rather obvious thing for anybody used to their mobile phone, but the iPad has been rather restrictive about its home screen and which widgets you can put on it. Since iPadOS 17 arrived, you can hold down on the lock screen to customize the background of the lock screen and the home screen. Of course, you can change the wallpaper, but you can also add a selection of widgets to the lock screen, change the font and color of the date and time, and even set whether you prefer the preset dark or light mode with the two buttons on the bottom right. The preset wallpapers are all pretty nice, though the Astronomy versions are my personal favorite. You can swap between the Earth, the Moon, or any of the other planets in our solar system. If it reminds you of iOS, that’s kinda the point. It also lets you customize widgets on your Home Screen. These widgets are interactable, meaning if you click on some of them, you can mark reminders or turn on lights without having to open individual apps. You can find all the available widgets by holding down on the home screen and then pressing the plus button on the top right of the screen once it comes up. Yes, I know, it’s all really basic, but to get the most out of your new iPad, it’s important to start with the simple things. 3 / 11 If you don’t know about Spotlight on iOS or iPadOS, then this one’s for you. Simply swiping down from the center of the screen brings up a search bar that makes it far easier to find the app you’re looking for without digging around too much. If you type in a website, you can also quickly bring up Safari or your other installed browsers to go to that webpage. For those who haven’t used an iPad in iPadOS 17.5, there’s actually been several improvements that allow you to accomplish tasks like quickly turning off Bluetooth without having to access the specific Bluetooth settings menu. But what if you want to access search from anywhere without first going exiting an app? Hey, there’s a simple setting that can help you out. 4 / 11 You can use some of the basic Accessibility options to access actions like Spotlight Search with a few customized gestures. First, go into Settings , then Touch . Click on the Assistive Touch and toggle it on. This creates a small icon on the iPad Screen that looks like a circle inside a square. Next, scroll down to the Custom Actions panel; you can set a custom action for when you long press or double tap. I personally set my Spotlight to open on a double tap on my screen, but you can set it to do something as simple as take a screenshot or bring up Siri. You can also create your own gesture using the Create New Gesture function as well. Now, if you double press the Assistive Touch button, you can access specific functions like Spotlight or your camera without bringing up the app. This can be very helpful for some folks, though I’m sure some others might not like how much it clutters up the screen. While there’s no basic calculator on iPad, funnily enough, Spotlight does also have a built-in calculator for solving simple math equations. 5 / 11 So you don’t actually need a Magic Keyboard to use a trackpad-like motion to select text on iPadOS. When you have the virtual keyboard up on the screen, if you use two fingers or tap and hold the spacebar, the keyboard will turn blank, and you can then move your finger back and forth across the screen to shift the cursor to any part of the on-screen text. Is that not useful enough for you? You can also do it even when selecting emojis from the special emoji menu on iPadOS. On the bottom of the emoji bar is the small “space” key. Hold that, and you’ll have the same ability to move the cursor anywhere on the text box. 6 / 11 If you weren’t around for iPads back when Apple released its Stage Manager mode on iPadOS 16, you probably had no idea there was more than one mode for multitasking on iPad. If you go into settings and search for Multitasking & Gestures, you see right at the top there are several modes and options for managing your apps. By default, it sits on Split View & Slide Over. This mode allows you to have two apps side by side when you press on the three dots at the top of each app. You can have one additional app available in a floating menu. This works, but Stage Manager is the superior option for most people who are used to a desktop experience. Here, you’ll use those same three dots to add a number of apps together at once, and you can move them around or rescale them to a few preset forms. On the left, you’ll see a row of other open apps or app groups, and pressing them swaps out the current set. This mode is also best for when you’re connected to an external display, but be warned, it still isn’t anywhere near perfect for multitasking. 7 / 11 Navigating between apps on an iPad can occasionally be a chore. However, if this is your first time using an Apple-brand tablet, you should familiarize yourself with some of the most common swiping gestures. The first one I want you to remember is the four-finger swipe. This will switch you over to the next currently active app or app group, depending on whether you’re using Stage Manager or Split View. The next gesture I would suggest learning is the three-finger swipe left. This lets you undo your last action or written text. It’s especially helpful if you’re not using a Magic Keyboard and you’re trying to quickly undo it when you accidentally delete a whole ream of text. If you use three fingers and move it to the right, you’ll redo the action you undid. You might want to learn a few other handy gestures, but if you don’t want any of the productivity or four-finger gestures, you can toggle them off in the Multitasking & Gestures menu mentioned before. 8 / 11 For whatever reason, you may need to disable the touch sensitivity on a part of the screen. Well, surprisingly, the iPad’s Guided Access lets you do that. First, you’ll need to go into the Accessibility menu under settings and toggle on Guided Access. Note that sometimes the iPad won’t allow you to use Guided Access until you restart it. This happened my first time trying it, but it was working fine once I restarted the tablet. Now, when you triple-click the power button when in an app, you should see a separate Guided Access menu on top of your app. Here, you can go down to Options and select which functions you don’t wish to work. You can set a timer for how long this lasts. If you ever need to disable it, you need to hit the power button three times once more and click End . 9 / 11 Here’s one for folks who don’t need the keyboard to take up their iPad screen. Pinch down on the keyboard to shrink it, then expand your fingers to make it big again. If you hate gesture controls, there’s another way to do it. When you bring up the keyboard, hold down on the button on the bottom right with the small icon and the arrow underneath it. You’ll see a small button that says Floating . Hit that, and your keyboard will now look pretty much exactly like it does on iOS. You can drag it around anywhere on the screen, and when you want it to become big again, drag it to the bottom portion of the iPad. 10 / 11 The iPad’s camera is incredibly adept at detecting when there’s text in its field of view, basically making it incredibly easy to digitally record anything from business cards or, in my case, the details of the recent Lego Star Wars TIE Interceptor . The document scanning feature itself is very good at detecting if you’re looking at a piece of paper, allowing you to scan multiple pages in a row and then quickly edit and save them. What’s more, on the latest iPad Pro, the document scanning feature has gotten even better at recognizing forms or receipts. It also removes shadows with a so-called “adaptive flash” and then stitches together multiple photos to get the best scan. I tried this out on a set of documents under some pretty dim light settings, and it was indeed pretty damn good at picking out the right light level and orientation for the documents. 11 / 11"

    "article_content": "In this economy, we could all use extra help. I am a coupon queen, saving money wherever I can and recuperating dollars and cents/sense as I make purchases. I’m already initiated into Google Play Points and redeeming them for cash and credit. This week, Google announced more ways to get free money. You will have to spend your time, however. Google Play Points has been a cashback perk for Android users since its debut in 2019. Play Points can be earned by purchasing in-app items, movies, books, and subscriptions. There are four spending tiers, and the higher your tier —the more you consecutively spend on the platform—the better the weekly rewards. You can redeem your Play Points for various things. I’ve traded them up for movie rentals in the Play Store and in-game currency for games like Pokémon Go and Hello Kitty Friends . I’m currently sitting on 1,830 points, roughly $15 in Play Store credit. If you’re on Android, using Android apps, and subscribing to services through the Google Play module, you should be signed up for Google Play Points. All you have to do is open the Google Play Store app, tap your profile icon, and then tap Play Points. Once you join , you’ll enroll in the program in perpetuity. From there, it’s up to you to spend, spend, spend. As you spend more on your device, your Play Points level will rise depending on how often you throw out a dollar. Your perks increase, too. For instance, folks in the Gold level, where I’m ranked, get 1.2 points per dollar and access to Gold weekly prizes. There is a Platinum and Diamond tier to aspire to, where the points per dollar increase ever-so-slightly. Plus, you get premium access to Google Play Store customer support. You can chat with a helper before anyone else does! Beginning June 17, Play Store Points earners in the U.S. can earn extra points by playing games. The first game is Diamond Valley , a mini-game featuring treasure hunting. You’ll be able to win prizes like Pixel devices and acquire extra points with each play session. Earners in the Gold, Platinum, and Diamond tiers will also have access to new mobile games before their release. It’s all part of an incentive to get you to spend more inside Google’s Android ecosystem."

    "article_content": "Games are expensive, and for some, it’s far too expensive to be a regular hobby. That makes shopping for deals that much more of a necessity. I’m here to offer a few tried and tested ways to find good deals on games, including legitimate ways to find games to play for free. Game streaming is a fair enough deal for some folks with a strong internet connection, but to get access to games directly from your computer you’ll have to do a bit more digging. And no, sorry, I’m not talking about pirating. I’m here to simply offer you a few hints where you can, and should, keep your eye open for a free game drop. Plus you may already have subscriptions to other services like Netflix or Amazon that also offer the chance to pick up free games either for download or through streaming. At this point, we should note that accessing many of these games is not the same thing as “owning” them. If you have a massive Steam library or a Game Pass account, you don’t own any of those properties but simply have a license to use the games on that service. With a lot of these platforms like Epic Games Store or Amazon’s Luna, accessing their free games is tied to that particular service. We’re truly in an age of media non-ownership . There are a few outliers such as GOG, which also occasionally shares games for free on a limited-time basis, but they’re the exception to the rule. Considering that lack of ownership, I’d argue it’s in all our best interest to try and procure as many games for free or cheap as possible. If you’re ever in a place where you’re on a shoestring budget but you still have the hardware to game, there are a few places to find what you’re looking for. If you still haven’t heard of Epic Games Store’s free weekly games , just know that it’s legitimately one of the best ways to get some pretty quality titles for, yes, free. Sure you have to go through the Epic Games Launcher, but there’s a reason Epic has been so adamant about trying to establish competition for Steam. Is it worth having two launchers on your desktop? Yes, of course it is. It’s not just games either. Currently, Epic is offering a deal for 1 month of free Discord Nitro. Sure, they can’t all be winners, but there’s no reason to not add games to your library whenever you get the chance. The hard part is remembering each week to check on which games are available. Currently, Epic Games Store is offering the fun, engrossing, though very repetitive Dragon Age Inquisition: Definitive Edition . You can actually set Epic Games to notify you about free games by going into the desktop app, clicking on your profile, and hitting Settings . Make sure Show News and Special Offers are on. This can be very annoying with popups, so you also might try the EpicFreeGames Discord bot to set up these quick notifications. On Steam Deck , there’s a program called Decky Loader that allows you to install easily-accessible Deck plugins. One of those is Free Games, which alerts you to free titles on the Epic Games Store. For those who want something a little less in your face, check out the section on subreddits below for easy ways to alert yourself on new deals. If you, your friend, or your family pays the $140 a year for Prime or the $9 for Prime Video, then take advantage of that because you can get a gaggle of fairly good games for free just by linking your accounts . This used to be more to do with your Amazon account linked to the Twitch gaming app, though now that Prime Gaming exists you’ll need to go through that service. Currently, you can claim The Forgotten City, an excellent mystery adventure and exploration game with some truly great writing behind it. If you never played it, you can also try out Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition or hop online for some knightly mayhem with Chivalry 2. Amazon does occasionally add more games there, so it’s good to keep an eye out for any new titles or deals. You’ll also have access to some perks like free in-game cosmetics or items. Games are constantly being shifted on and off the service, so I’d recommend checking back every once in a while to find out which new games are available. Other free games are streaming only through Luna. The service is indeed included with Prime, though you might not get as much mileage out of it compared to some other services like Game Pass. For some reason, that includes Fallout: New Vegas (easily one of the best Fallout games you can play if you enjoyed the TV show). You can also play Batman: Arkham City, Resident Evil 2 or Metro Exodus , both of which deserve your attention if you still haven’t tried them. I try to bring up the bevy of Netflix games available to subscribers every now and then, not only because it’s a great deal if you already have a subscription, but because there are new games that come online practically every month. Most recently, Netflix added Braid, Anniversary Edition for those who want to reminisce about the origins of indie darlings on Xbox Arcade. Other games from this month include Sonic Mania Plus, Katana Zero, and Paper Trail. All those might deserve a looksie, but I personally would point you to the free version of Hades or the re-released original three 3D Grand Theft Auto titles. Eventually, we might be able to play these games through a web browser or through the app on our TVs, but that’s currently still in beta and it’s restricted to a bare few of Netflix’s gaming slate. We should also note that you’re required to sign in to Netflix for any title you download, and some of them require an internet connection to play. That’s a very annoying bit of DRM attached to what’s otherwise a fair deal. If you haven’t checked out the r/GameDealsFree subreddit, you should. A handy bot trolls the threads of some of the more popular game deal subs and alerts you to certain deals. While r/GameDeals is another great resource for finding sales on shops like Steam, you may still pay out of pocket for some of them. You also might have some luck with r/FreeGameFindings , though I would suggest you try to avoid anything that seems shady or asks you to subscribe to some service or Twitch channel. There’s also the r/FreeGameFindings sub where you’ll find folks posting some free deals on existing games DLC or, occasionally, a free deal gem. Reddit might be the best place to find games with limited-time free offers on services like Steam, as those rarely make it to the store’s front page. It’s old-hat at this point, but the Humble Bundle is still a place to go for good deals. The organization bundles various types of games together under certain themes and uses a pay-what-you-want model to give to charity. No, it’s not completely free, but you can often get several pretty good games for as low as $3. Often, you’ll need to pay a bit more to get recent or more popular titles. Gone are the days when you could choose to pay $.01 for a bunch of games. The site has hard limits on what you’re allowed to pay for games and what kind of cut it takes in kind. It’s a bummer, but heck, if all you’re looking for is a good deal with the chance to give to charity, there are few sites that are better."

    "article_content": "Game streaming is big , and it just keeps getting bigger. If you’re desperate to play some games without the necessity of downloading them to your PC or console, you can get them easily with an Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus subscription. The biggest game console makers without a name that rhymes with “ spinflendo ” each have their own services allowing you to play games directly from your console or else any PC with a strong enough internet connection. Your mileage may vary depending on whether you’re a PlayStation mainliner or a ride-or-die Xbox fan. Game Pass has been going strong for years , and its cloud-based service has managed to include some notable first-party and third-party titles. PlayStation cloud-based services only arrived late last year , and it’s somewhat hampered by a lack of current or other big-name titles that make paying the nearly $20 totally worth it. We should also note that Xbox allows you to stream games through a browser, making it possible to stream its titles on a tablet, phone, or handheld like a Steam Deck. On the flip side, PlayStation has yet to create a webpage to allow for streaming outside its official app. Sorry, the PlayStation Porta l doesn’t count as true everywhere streaming. At the very least, these services are evolving. According to a Wall Street Journal report , just this week, Microsoft finally confirmed it would bring the next Call of Duty title, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, to Game Pass right from the get-go this October. More news might be coming during the company’s big game showcase on June 9. At the same time, PlayStation is routinely adding more games to try to entice more customers to PlayStation Plus Premium. It recently added the cowboy simulator Red Dead Redemption 2 and the social stealth game Deceive Inc. Just know that many of these games aren’t available for streaming, for now. Accessing the games is rather easy whether you’re doing so on your console or your PC. Accessing the games themselves is very easy on Game Pass on Xbox Series X or Series S. With your subscription enabled on the main menu, go up to the top icons and click on the Game Pass icon. You can hit Show All to see all the available games and select the one you wish to play on the cloud. It should have a small cloud icon on it rather than a down arrow, which denotes it’s only available to play directly from the console. Otherwise, you can scroll down until you see Game Pass membership benefits . Click where it says Cloud gaming, and you’ll bring up the full list of games you can play on the cloud. For Game Pass on PC, the setup is very similar. The Xbox app should be automatically installed with every copy of Windows 11, but if it’s missing, you’ll want to grab it from the Microsoft Store. Once that’s all set and you’re signed in, you need to head to the Cloud Gaming tab on the Xbox app. You can scroll through the entire list or search for the specific cloud-based game you wish to play. Alternatively, you can sign in to the Xbox cloud gaming website to access all the same titles from anything from a phone to a tablet. Game Pass Ultimate is easily one of the best services for game streaming, and most of it comes down to its very wide game selection featuring current and plenty of past titles. You can find several modern and recent games like Senua’s Saga : Hellblade II or last year’s Starfield alongside popular indie titles like Palworld or even the stellar though largely ignored Another Crab’s Treasure. There are modern sleeper hits like Pentiment and original Xbox classics like Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge. It’s $17 a month for Game Pass Ultimate, though Xbox does promote a 14-day trial for $1 that automatically brings you to the full price if you forget to cancel. There are more than 400 titles available on the platform for streaming. You can find the total list of games on Xbox’s website . The $18-a-month PlayStation Plus Premium subscription nets you access to the service’s cloud gaming feature. With it enabled, you need to navigate on the main menu’s icons all the way to the left, where you can select your PlayStation Plus account. You’ll see a range of options from Latest to Games. If you select Games, you should come across all the current titles available to either download or stream. However, you won’t immediately be able to tell which ones are streaming enabled just by their icon. Instead, if you roll over to Benefits and go down to where you have the option for Cloud Streaming, you can then hit View Games to see the total selection of available streaming games. Streaming on PC is similar to streaming on a console, though it involves the special PlayStation Plus app. You have to download it from Sony’s site . The app itself is very bare bones and still buggy (it took me several attempts to sign in to my PlayStation account). You’ll need a compatible controller, and if you want to listen to audio, you’ll need to have the right output connected to the PC and not your controller. The game selection on PlayStation Plus isn’t all it could be. Sure, you can play the awesome samurai epic Ghost of Tsushima or the modern classic Dredge. Still, there are relatively few more recent or more expensive titles like Demon’s Souls and Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart . There are far fewer recent games save for the excellent Metroidvania Animal Well or other classic games like 2Xtreme and Worms Pinball ."

    "article_content": "YouTube appears to be stepping up its long war on ad blockers this week. The creator of SponsorBlock, a crowdsourced ad blocker, posted a tweet on Wednesday claiming YouTube is experimenting with server-side ad injection. This would inject ads directly into a video’s stream, and render many ad blockers useless. “YouTube is improving its performance and reliability in serving both organic and ad video content,” said a Google spokesperson in an emailed statement to Gizmodo, when asked if it was injecting server-side ads. “This update may result in suboptimal viewing experiences for viewers with ad blockers installed. Ad blockers violate YouTube’s Terms of Service, and we’ve been urging viewers for some time to support their favorite creators and allow ads on YouTube or try YouTube Premium for an ad-free experience.” The introduction of server-side ads only seems to be affecting a few users for now, but it appears to be YouTube’s latest hit in its long war on ad blockers . As Bleeping Computer explains, YouTube has traditionally performed client-side ad injection, where the ads and video came to your desktop or mobile app separately. Then your video player is programmed to inject ads throughout. Traditional ad blockers identify this programming and navigate around it. Some affected users took to the r/youtube subreddit to complain about the new feature. One Redditor claimed they received 90 seconds of unskippable ads before every video. Others went on X to share their grievances , noting that the server-side ads disable playback controls when playing. With server-side ads, the ads are injected into a video before it comes to your desktop or mobile app. That breaks most ad blockers and could make it difficult to watch YouTube videos if you have one installed. SponsorBlock later noted that that it set up a server to detect when server-side ads were occurring, and rejecting submissions to prevent its database from being corrupted. Google maintains that these ad blockers hurt the YouTube ecosystem, claiming that a majority of ad revenue goes to paying out creators. However, it’s also a major way YouTube itself makes revenue. Previously, Google tormented users with ad blockers by making videos unplayable and showing a never-ending loading screen. Another time, it delivered users an immovable prompt to disable the adblocker."

    "article_content": "We all know that Elon Musk likes procreation. He has 11 kids, after all . The tech billionaire currently has twins with an executive at Neuralink, two children with his on-again-off-again girlfriend Grimes, and a gaggle of children with his ex-wife, Justine Wilson. The billionaire was also accused of asking a former SpaceX employee if she would “have his babies.” The guy is pretty liberal with his sperm, to say the least. But Musk isn’t just concerned about his own breeding habits. He also wants the rest of the world to think about how they can up their household headcount, too. He proved this, once again, during a conversation with the Cato Institute on Wednesday, the prominent libertarian think tank founded by Charles Koch. The conversation, which was meant to discuss “liberty” (the libertarian codeword for “free markets”) in Argentina, dovetailed, at one point, into a conversation about plummeting global birthrates and why the current “baby bust” could signal a catastrophic outcome for the human race writ large. “I do worry about certain existential risks, like the low birth rate, which is accelerating in most countries,” Musk said. “This is one of those things that I think is underrated as an issue—which is that if there’s no humans, there’s no humanity. You have to make them somehow. I think we should be very concerned about the accelerating implosion of the birthrate.” Musk continued: “This is a super big deal. Basically, nothing else matters if there are no humans. As an initial premise, you must first have humans for there to be civilization—unless we’re going to leave it all to the robots...I don’t have a great solution to it but it must be solved somehow or humanity will dwindle to nothing.” During his pro-procreation diatribe, Musk also took the opportunity to take a swipe at the environmentalist movement, which is an admittedly weird move for a guy who runs an electric car company. “I do think that one sort of bad thing about the environmentalist movement is that—in the extreme form of the environmentalist movement—people start to view humans as a plague on the surface of the Earth, as a fundamentally bad thing, with the implication that if all humans disappear somehow Earth would be better off,” Musk said. “This is the Extinctionist movement. I think you can really, at a fundamental level, think of things as a fight between the Expansionist and Extinctionist philosophies. And that’s what really matters.” “If humans go extinct or civilization collapses, whatever policies we may have are irrelevant,” he continued. “So, first and foremost, we must have an Expansionist philosophy for civilization and for consciousness. We must seek to go beyond what we’ve done in the past to increase the number of humans.” “So the final message is go forth and procreate,” the Cato Institute interviewer said. “Yes,” Musk said, grinning. Musk isn’t totally wrong that dropping birthrates is a legitimate concern for many countries, though commentators have generally disagreed about the severity of the problem as well as what to do about it. The jury is also still out on what exactly is causing droves of young people all over the world to opt out of family life. Some people have blamed feminism , the growth of “anti-family” cultures, and the “radical” “Left.” Others, like Musk, blame a pervasive, pessimistic worldview that dissuades people from having kids. It could also be that, due to years of runaway costs for things like housing, education, and childcare, it’s become prohibitively expensive for most middle-class people to actually have children. An article in Vogue last year asked if having kids had become a “luxury item,” one that only upper-income brackets could comfortably afford. Given that one study clocks the total cost of raising a kid from diapers to a high-school diploma to be about $300,000 in the U.S. (this is not even to mention the increasingly costly 4-year college degree that has become a necessity for white-collar jobs), you can see why the median American might be somewhat priced out of something like that. That said, it’s typically lower-income communities that have the highest birth rates . So the situation is complicated."

    "article_content": "Over a dozen Wells Fargo employees were fired last month for trying to fool their bosses into thinking they were working when they were not, as first reported by Bloomberg Thursday. It seems they were unsuccessful. A regulatory filing with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) says the bank investigated the staff’s “simulation of keyboard activity” and let some folks go who were creating the “impression of active work.” While the filing doesn’t specify further, it appears to be referring to “mouse jigglers” that took off during the pandemic. These devices sit on your mouse or trackpad and periodically move it an inch, to simulate an active status on your work computer. You can find them on Amazon for $20 to $30 , but if you’re not careful, it could also cost you your job. “Wells Fargo holds employees to the highest standards and does not tolerate unethical behavior,” a company spokesperson said in a statement to Bloomberg. Most of these employees were relatively recent hires, but one had worked with the bank for more than seven years, according to The Financial Times . It’s unclear exactly how Wells Fargo caught these employees. Technology writer and lawyer Paul Skallas writes that it’s important to plug your mouse jiggler into a separate electrical socket. Skallas notes that plugging one into the USB on your laptop can let your company know you are using one. These firings come just a few weeks after FINRA reinstated rules that require close supervision of employees’ working setups. The rule , which was paused during the pandemic, mandates that banks treat their employees’ homes as “non-branch locations” that are subject to the same inspections and requirements as an office. Wells Fargo currently adopts a hybrid flexible work model that requires employees to be in office three days a week, according to Bloomberg. But it seems employees were home twice a week jiggling their mice while doing something else. In the years since the pandemic, several companies have issued stricter in-office policies to limit the time employees spend slacking off at home. There’s a pervasive idea that remote work is not as effective as in-person work, especially in finance. Despite the use of mouse jigglers, there’s relatively little evidence that employees actually get less work done at home. A study from the University of Pittsburgh recently found that return-to-office mandates did little to improve productivity."

    "article_content": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has opened yet another investigation into Boeing, this one centered around concerns that counterfeit titanium may have been installed in some of the aviation giant’s planes. Boeing reportedly admitted to the federal agency that some components in their planes were sold to their supplier using fake documentation that attested to the authenticity of the metal, according to the New York Times Friday. Spirit AeroSystems, which supplies a number of critical components to Boeing, including fuselages, is also currently investigating the matter. The issue of the authenticity of the metal in the planes’ components raises potential “structural integrity” issues, the Times notes. The newspaper breaks down the potential extent of the problem thusly: The planes that included components made with the material were built between 2019 and 2023, among them some Boeing 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner airliners as well as Airbus A220 jets, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. It is not clear how many of those planes are in service or which airlines own them... ...The titanium in question has been used in a variety of aircraft parts, according to Spirit officials. For the 787 Dreamliner, that includes the passenger entry door, cargo doors and a component that connects the engines to the plane’s airframe. For the 737 Max and the A220, the affected parts include a heat shield that protects a component, which connects a jet’s engine to the frame, from extreme heat. Boeing isn’t the only company that is afflicted with the problem. The Times reports that European airplane maker Airbus is also dealing with the issue. Gizmodo reached out to Boeing and the FAA for comment and will update this story if they respond. In a statement shared with the Times, the FAA says that the airplane maker had made a “voluntary disclosure” that involved the “procurement of material through a distributor who may have falsified or provided incorrect records. Boeing issued a bulletin outlining ways suppliers should remain alert to the potential of falsified records.” “This industrywide issue affects some shipments of titanium received by a limited set of suppliers, and tests performed to date have indicated that the correct titanium alloy was used,” Boeing told the newspaper. “To ensure compliance, we are removing any affected parts on airplanes prior to delivery. Our analysis shows the in-service fleet can continue to fly safely.” This issue goes onto the growing list of Boeing’s problems. The company is under investigation by a slew of federal agencies and has been the subject of a cascade of whistleblower complaints, as well as a Congressional hearing . Much of the trouble for the company began in January when an Alaska Airlines flight involving a Boeing 737 Max 9 lost a part of its fuselage mid-flight. Since then, increased scrutiny on the plane maker’s production standards has spurred concerns that the company has sometimes prioritized profit over safety."

Not only do these wonderful little pests swarm you, suck your blood, and leave unattractive splotches all over your skin, but they’re also known to transport many of the viruses that routinely kill loads of people. Now, some local governments are deploying drones to help fight the insect scourge. Broward County, Florida recently began using one of the automated devices to “spray for mosquitoes in hard-to-reach places,” according to a report from the South Florida Sun Sentinel on Wednesday. Local governments routinely spray mosquito breeding grounds to kill the larvae that could ultimately grow into dangerous, disease-carrying bugs. Until recently, teams had to be sent out to Florida’s marshy environs where Aedes mosquitoes (also known as “Yellow fever mosquitoes”) laid their eggs. Now, Broward officials can send out drones to get the job done without any need for human suffering, the Sentinel reports: Until now, crews could spend days covering a single territory that’s inaccessible by truck, wading in mud, armed with a machete to get past bushy trees. “These poor guys who have to go in there,” lamented Anh Ton, director of Broward’s Highway & Bridge Maintenance Division, a division of the county’s Public Works Department, which oversees its Mosquito Control Division . Now, the drone is traveling to where the breed of mosquitoes...lay their eggs. Using drones to fight mosquitoes is not an unprecedented trend. Back in 2013, Florida tested the use of drones to find pools of water where mosquitoes could spawn in large numbers. These drones, however, are getting right into the battle with the insects, and other counties across the U.S. are doing the same. In California, Orange and Santa Clara counties, among others, recently began doing a similar tactic with drones . Prior to drone use, local governments tended to rely on larger aircraft, like planes and helicopters to drop pesticides on the insects, the Associated Press has reported ."

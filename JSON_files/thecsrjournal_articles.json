    "article_content": "पेशे से ट्रक ड्राइवर अविनाश कुमार नाशिक से मुंबई हर दिन सब्जियां लेकर आते है। बड़ी ही सावधानी से पिछले 10 सालों से अविनाश ट्रक चलाने का काम करते है। अविनाश भगवान का शुक्रिया अदा करते है कि अब तक उनसे ऐसी कोई दुर्घटना नहीं घटी हो जिससे किसी का नुकसान हुआ हो लेकिन जब The CSR Journal ने नए कानून ‘हिट एंड रन’ की बात की तो अविनाश कहने लगे कि नया हिट एंड रन कानून (New Hit and Run Law in India) हम सभी ड्राइवर्स (Bus and Truck Drivers Strike) के लिए ऐसा बन गया है कि आगे कुआं पीछे खाई। अविनाश भी नए कानून का विरोध कर रहे हैं। ड्राइवर और भीड़ दोनों को अपनी नागरिक सामाजिक जिम्मेदारी निभानी चाहिए नए कानून का विरोध करने वाले ड्राइवर (Truck Driver Strike) का कहना है कि अगर दुर्घटना के बाद वे मौके से फरार होते हैं तो उन्हें 10 साल की सजा हो जाएगी। अगर वे मौके पर ही रुक जाते हैं तो भीड़ उन पर हमला करके पीट पीट कर मार देगी। ड्राइवरों के लिए आगे कुआं और पीछे खाई वाली स्थिति हो गई। यह बात सही भी है कि कई बार उग्र भीड़ हिंसक रूप ले लेती है और मामला मॉब लिंचिंग का रूप ले लेता है। ( Road Safety ) ऐसे परिस्तिथियों में सिटीजन सोशल रिस्पांसिबिलिटी निभाने की जरुरत दोनों यानी ड्राइवर और भीड़ को है। Citizen Social Responsibility का परिचय देते हुए ड्राइवर को हर हाल में सावधानी पूर्वक गाड़ी चलानी चाहिए और अगर किसी कारणवश दुर्घटना (Road Accident) होती भी है तो उसे पीड़ित को अस्पताल पहुंचाना चाहिए और भीड़ को भी कानून हाथ में लिए बिना ड्राइवर के साथ मारपीट नहीं करनी चाहिए। Hit And Run New Law – क्या है नया ‘हिट एंड रन’ कानून, देशभर में ड्राइवर क्यों कर रहे इसके खिलाफ प्रदर्शन केंद्र सरकार ने हाल ही में संसद में नया हिट एंड रन विधेयक पास किया है। इस बिल को राष्ट्रपति द्रौपदी मुर्मू की मंजूरी भी मिल चुकी है। अब यह भारतीय न्याय संहिता के तहत नया कानून बन चुका है। हालांकि, इस नए कानून में जो प्रावधान जोड़े गए हैं, उन प्रावधानों का देशभर में विरोध हो रहा है। हिट एंड रन केस में अगर ड्राइवर एक्सीडेंट के बाद फरार हो जाता है और हादसे में किसी की मौत हो जाती है तो ड्राइवर को दस साल की कैद की सजा का प्रावधान है। सजा के साथ जुर्माना भी भरने का प्रावधान है। नए कानून में ड्राइवर के खिलाफ सख्त कार्रवाई वाले प्रावधान को लेकर Drivers विरोध कर रहे। जानिए क्या होता है हिट एंड रन What is new Hit and Run Law and why Truck and Bus Rrivers protesting? हिट एंड रन का सीधा मतलब होता है कि दुर्घटना के बाद ड्राइवर का गाड़ी के साथ मौके से भाग जाना। अगर किसी गाड़ी से किसी को टक्कर लग गई और घायल की मदद करने के बजाय ड्राइवर गाड़ी लेकर फरार हो जाता है तो ऐसे केस हिट एंड रन में गिने जाते हैं। हिट एंड रन के पुराने कानून के मुताबिक ऐसे मामलों में ड्राइवर को जमानत भी मिल जाती थी और अधिकतम दो साल की सजा का प्रावधान था। हम आपको बता दें कि दुर्घटना (Road Accident) में घायल व्यक्ति को अगर एक्सीडेंट करने वाला समय (Golden Hour in Accident) पर अस्पताल पहुंचा देता है तो उसकी जान बच जाती है। हालांकि, एक्सीडेंट के बाद मौके से भागने के केस को हिट एंड रन कहा जाता है। ऐसी ही केस में सख्ती का प्रावधान किया गया है। नए कानून में क्या है जिसकी वजह से ड्राइवर गुस्से में है भारतीय न्याय संहिता में हिट एंड रन कानून में जो नए प्रावधान हैं, उसके मुताबिक अगर गाड़ी ड्राइवर हादसे के बाद पुलिस को सूचना दिए बिना फरार होता है तो उसे 10 साल की सजा होगी। इसके साथ ही भारी जुर्माना भी वसूला जाएगा। इस कड़े प्रावधान का देशभर के ट्रक, ट्रेलर, बस, पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट और टैक्सी ड्राइवर विरोध कर रहे हैं। देश के कई शहरों में, कई राज्यों में इस नए कानून के विरोध में प्रदर्शन हो रहे हैं और हाइवे जाम किए जा रहे हैं। दुर्घटना के आंकड़े बताते हैं कि हिट एंड रन के मामलों में हर साल देश में 50 हजार लोगों की मौत हो जाती है। मौतों के इन आंकड़ों को देखते हुए ड्राइवरों पर सख्ती करते हुए नए कानून में सख्त प्रावधान जोड़े गए हैं। बहरहाल अगर ड्राइवर और भीड़ दोनों Citizen Social Responsibility का परिचय देते हैं तो नया कानून कारगर साबित होगा।"

    "article_content": "ये कहानी है ऐसे आईएएस अफसर की जिसे पढ़ाने के लिए मां ने देसी शराब बेचा। ये कहानी ऐसे आईएएस अफसर की है जिसके घर की आर्थिक हालात ऐसी थी कि दो वक़्त की रोटी भी सही से नसीब नहीं हो पाता था। लेकिन मेहनत और लगन से किस्मत बदला जा सकता है और ये कारनामा कर दिखाया डॉ राजेंद्र भरुड़ ने। डॉ राजेंद्र भारुड़ ( IAS Rajendra Bharud) का बचपन बेहद गरीबी में गुजरा। उनके परिवार की आर्थिक स्थिति बेहद खराब थी और उनके पिता का निधन हो गया, जब वे मां के गर्भ में थे। जैसे-तैसे उनकी मां और दादी ने एक झोपड़ी में रहकर शराब बेचने का काम किया और जीवन व्यापन करने लगे। आईएएस राजेंद्र भारुड़ ने झोपड़ी में रहकर की पढ़ाई जब राजेंद्र तीन चार महीने के थे, तब उनके रोने पर कुछ कस्टमर उन्हें शराब की कुछ बूंदे चटा देते थे जिसके बाद वे सो जाते थे। जब वे थोड़े बड़े हुए तो उन्हें कस्टमर के लिए पास की दुकान से स्नैक्स लाने पड़ते थे। लेकिन उनका मन हमेशा से पढ़ाई में रहा (IAS Aspirant)। एक दिन जब राजेंद्र से एक ग्राहक ने स्नैक्स लाने के लिए कहा, तो उन्होंने कहा कि वह पढ़ाई कर रहे हैं। इस पर उस व्यक्ति ने कहा कि तुम भील समाज में पैदा हुए हो, तुम भी शराब ही बेचोगे। भील का बेटा क्या कलेक्टर बनेगा। एक ताने ने बदल दी आईएएस राजेंद्र भारुड़ की जिंदगी यह ताना सुनकर राजेंद्र और उनकी मां खूब रोई थीं। धीरे-धीरे राजेंद्र बड़े हुए तो उन्होंने अपनी किस्मत बदलने का फैसला किया। इंटरमीडिएट के बाद उन्होंने मेडिकल का एंट्रेंस एग्जाम क्लियर कर लिया और एमबीबीएस की डिग्री हासिल कर ली। इसके बाद उन्होंने यूपीएससी की तैयारी थी और लगातार दो बार परीक्षा क्रैक कर आईएएस बनने का सपना पूरा कर लिया। चुनौतीपूर्ण रहा IAS Rajendra Bharud का जीवन, फिर भी सफलता की बुलंदियों को छुआ राजेंद्र ने बचपन से कठिन चुनौतियों का सामना किया। इसके बावजूद वे पढ़ाई को लेकर गंभीर रहें और आगे बढ़ते रहे। उनका जन्म महाराष्ट्र के आदिवासी भील समुदाय में हुआ था, जहां के तमाम लोगों की परिस्थितियां बेहद खराब होती हैं। लेकिन राजेंद्र ने शुरू से ही अपनी किस्मत को बदलने की ठान ली थी, जिसके लिए उन्होंने कड़ी मेहनत की। डॉक्टरी की पढ़ाई के दौरान ही उन्होंने सिविल सेवा की तैयारी की और आईएएस अफसर बन गए। आज वे महाराष्ट्र के आदिवासी संशोधन व प्रशिक्षण संस्था के प्रमुख है। डॉ राजेंद्र भारुड़ की कहानी हमें संघर्षों के बावजूद कोशिश करने की सलाह देती है। वे आज समाज के लिए मिसाल बन चुके हैं। कोरोना काल में आईएएस राजेंद्र भारुड़ की हुई थी जमकर तारीफ डॉक्टर होने के नाते राजेंद्र भारुड़ ने कोरोना के परिणाम को पहले ही भाप लिया था। कोरोना की दूसरी लहर आने से पहले ही राजेंद्र भारुड़ ने नंदुरबार जिले को ऑक्सीजन युक्त बना दिया था। कोरोना को पहला वेव खत्म हो गया था। जनजीवन पटरी पर लौटने लगा था। प्रशासन भी राहत की सांस लेने लगा था, मगर फरवरी से अचानक महाराष्ट्र से देश में कोरोना की दूसरी लहर शुरू हुई, ऑक्सीजन के अभाव में लोगों की मौतें होने लगी। लेकिन सितंबर 2020 में ही नंदुरबार जिला प्रशासन के प्रयासों से जिले में 600 लीटर प्रति मिनट उत्पादन वाला पहला ऑक्सीजन प्लांट स्थापित किया जा चुका था। इस काम के लिए राजेंद्र भारुड़ की खूब तारीफे हुई थी।"

This is a step taken by the ECI to ensure a level-playing field in the Lok Sabha elections. With the announcement of the Loksabha Elections 2024 and the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) entering into force, the ECI has directed the government to stop sending the WhatsApp messages highlighting the government’s initiatives for citizens’ welfare during the MCC period. The WhatsApp message sought feedback and suggestions from citizens related to government schemes and policies. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has offered an explanation to the ECI saying the letters were sent out before MCC period, but due to system architecture and network limitations it is possible that some letters have a delayed delivery. The ECI in its letter on Thursday has replied saying is has received several complaints that such messages are still being delivered on citizens’ phones. The Election Commission of India (ECI) says In a letter addressed to the Government of India dated 21st March 2024, the ECI mentions, “The Commission has received complaints from various quarters that such messages are still being delivered on citizens’ phones.

Your participation is critical as we, together as one Family, work towards fulfilling our aspiration of a Viksit Bharat. You are therefore requested to kindly share Feedback and Suggestions on your vision of Viksit Bharat’. There is a PDF attachment with the text message which talks about Government schemes like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Ayushman Bharat, Matru Vandana Yojana and initiatives like implementation of GST, abrogation of Article 370, Triple Talaq law, nari Shakti Vandan Act and steps taken to combat terrorism and left-wing extremism in the last 10 years.

We are running this collaboration during the Jewish holiday of Hannukah, when we light candles for eight nights. By bringing a bit of light into people’s lives, we hope to banish the darkness that COVID-19 has brought. Each of us should strive to be a small light, and together we can bring great light.” Under this collaboration, homeless families were provided weekly health checkups, medicines and sanitisation kits. Daily wage earners such as factory workers, construction workers, labourers and street vendors were given masks and sanitizers. In Delhi, dry ration kits containing rice, flour, pulses, oil and sugar were distributed among underprivileged women. Also, women who had lost their livelihoods in the garment industry during the pandemic received sewing machines to enable them to restart their work. Sanitary napkins were distributed among girls coming from economically weaker sections of the society. Women entrepreneurs returning to cities in search of work were given skill development training and personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. Women in rural areas of West Bengal were trained in poultry farming to enable them to generate income. Online classes were conducted for deaf children and youth, whose families cannot afford their education. Disclaimer: This media release is auto-generated.

    "article_content": "India celebrates National Startup Day to recognise the contributions of startup community in Indian economy. Deepinder Goyal Founder & CEO of Zomato once aptly said, “Everybody has to contribute towards building and sustaining a strong culture” and that is exactly what India is doing right now. Started in the year 2022 by the Government of India, January 16 is celebrated as National Startup Day to catalyse the startup culture, a dynamic force that has propelled the nation onto the global stage of entrepreneurship. As we reflect on the achievements, statistics, and pivotal events, it’s essential to spotlight the growing influence of eco-startups in India, which are not only reshaping the economy but also contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally conscious world. The Rise of Indian Startups National Startup Day provides an opportune moment to acknowledge the transformative growth of startups in India. With an unwavering entrepreneurial spirit, India stands tall as the third-largest startup ecosystem globally, boasting over 50,000 recognised startups by the end of 2020, according to NASSCOM. “Only the paranoid survive.” – Andy Grove, former CEO of Intel Investment Inflow: In the spirit of National Startup Day, it’s heartening to note that the Indian startup ecosystem witnessed an impressive investment inflow, surpassing $10 billion in 2021, as reported by Venture Intelligence. Unicorn Boom: The unicorn boom continues to flourish, with India contributing over 50 unicorns to the global landscape, reflecting the resilience and innovation within the startup culture. Sectoral Diversity: Today, Indian startups showcase a diversification across sectors, with a particular focus on eco-friendly initiatives. Sectors such as cleantech, agritech, and sustainable energy solutions are gaining prominence. Government Initiatives: Acknowledging the significance of eco-conscious endeavours, government initiatives like “Startup India” are playing a crucial role in supporting and promoting startups focused on environmental sustainability. Eco-Innovation in Focus A significant part of the startup ecosystem are the environmentally conscious innovations. Let’s shine a spotlight on the remarkable contributions of eco-startups in India. These enterprises are not only addressing environmental challenges but are actively creating solutions that help the world become a better place. “If you are working for a good cause, there is a divine force backing you.” – Madhurita Gupta, MyVets Charitable Trust Renewable Energy Pioneers: Eco-startups in India are at the forefront of revolutionising the energy sector. Companies like ReNew Power and Greenko are pioneering renewable energy solutions, contributing to the global shift towards cleaner and sustainable power sources. Agro-Innovators: Startups in agritech, such as CropIn and Ninjacart, are leveraging technology to enhance agricultural practices, promoting sustainable farming methods and reducing environmental impact. Waste Management Innovations: Cleantech startups like Kabadiwalla Connect and Blue Planet Environmental Solutions are leading the way in effective waste management solutions, promoting circular economies and reducing landfill burden. Key Events Shaping the Eco-Startup Landscape Everyone loves to talk about the startup boom, but very few focus on the strategic importance that the sector has been giving for it to be a contributing catalyst in the Indian Economy. From dedicating days in the calendar to celebrate this boom to enabling and encouraging more and more events around it, here are the key factors contributing to the growth of startup in India. “Many countries recover from crises. If India faces a bubble, it will be good and build resilience.” – Ritesh Agarwal, Oyo Rooms Eco-Conferences and Summits: Events like the Sustainability Conclave and GreenTech Expo provide platforms for eco-startups to showcase innovations, share insights, and collaborate with stakeholders. National Green Challenge: In alignment with National Startup Day, initiatives such as the National Green Challenge encourage startups to present eco-friendly solutions, fostering a spirit of innovation towards a sustainable future. As we celebrate National Startup Day, it’s evident that the trajectory of India’s startup culture is not just about economic growth but also about contributing meaningfully to global challenges. Eco-startups in India are at the forefront of this movement, actively shaping a future where innovation and sustainability go hand in hand. Today, we not only applaud the achievements but also look forward to a future where startups continue to drive positive change and make the world a better place for generations to come."

    "article_content": "Infosys is a global consulting and IT services company. It is a leader in next generation digital services and consulting across the world. The purpose of the company is, “To amplify human potential and create next opportunity for people, business and communities.” As the technologies change businesses across the globe, Infosys works to aid its clients navigate the transformation. Infosys has been an early proponent of responsible business practices. The company has therefore incorporated its ESG goals into the entirety of its operations. In the financial year 2023-24, the company spent a total of Rs. 577 Cr. on CSR across the world of which Rs. 455.67 Cr. was spent on various CSR projects in India. 1. CSR Philosophy of Infosys Infosys fulfils its social and environmental responsibilities by focusing on meeting the needs and expectations of the communities around which it operates. The company carries out its CSR in a way that goes beyond philanthropy by encouraging holistic community development and community welfare through institution building and streamlining sustainable development. 2. CSR Policy Infosys CSR Policy intends to: – Strive for economic development that positively impacts the society at large with a minimal resource footprint. – Embrace responsibility for the Company’s actions and encourage a positive impact through its activities on hunger, poverty, malnutrition, environment, communities, stakeholders and society. 2.1. CSR Committee According to the guidelines of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, the Company has constituted a Board-level CSR Committee to monitor the implementation of the Corporate Social Responsibility Policy of the Company from time to time. The Infosys Corporate Social Responsibility Committee comprises of: 1. Govind Iyer (Chairperson) 2. Chitra Nayak 3. Michael Gibbs The CSR committee performs the following functions: – Identify the areas of CSR activities, – Recommend the amount of expenditure for the CSR activities, – Implement and monitor the CSR Policy from time to time, – Formulate an annual CSR action plan and recommend it to the board, – Monitor company’s CSR activities from time to time, – Coordinate with Infosys Foundation or other implementing agencies for execution of CSR initiatives, – Review the impact assessment reports issued by independent agencies, – Review CSR reporting/disclosures as required, and – Review the issuing of certificate required to utilise CSR funds earmarked for specific projects. 3. Healthcare The Infosys Foundation has consistently placed healthcare as a top priority. With the aim of providing affordable, equitable, and high-quality healthcare to individuals regardless of their urban or rural residence, the Foundation has actively strived to enhance infrastructure, deliver cutting-edge medical equipment, promote awareness, strengthen public health initiatives, and facilitate timely research across various medical domains. 3.1 AIIMS Partnership In 2015-16, the collaboration between Infosys Foundation and AIIMS began with the establishment of a chair professorship in oncology aimed at supporting faculty scientists and students in pursuing research in this field. Subsequently, the Foundation expanded its chair professorships to include obstetrics and gynaecology. In 2019-20, the Foundation took the initiative to construct an 800-bed Dharamshala at the AIIMS Jhajjar campus, specifically within the premises of the National Cancer Institute. In 2021, AIIMS introduced a new MCH Block on the hospital premises in New Delhi. This block encompasses 455 beds dedicated to the inpatient care of obstetrics, gynaecology, and pediatric patients. It includes 72 Intensive Care Unit beds, 17 Operation Theatre beds, and two beds exclusively for In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). AIIMS approached the Foundation for support in swiftly operationalizing the block by providing essential, high-end medical equipment across departments such as obstetrics, gynaecology, paediatrics, pediatric surgery, anesthesiology, and radiology. The Foundation’s grant also facilitated the establishment of a specialized state-of-the-art genetic lab and computerized enterprise imaging data management system within the block. Through the Foundation’s grant, a wide range of equipment, including ultrasound machines, incubators, ventilators, dialysis machines, monitors, OT tables, and laboratory equipment, was procured. The MCH block is expected to be fully operational by the end of June 2023, with most services already functioning. The outpatient services are fully operational, while inpatient and OT services are partially available. In addition to the requirements for the MCH Block, AIIMS also approached the Foundation for support in implementing an integrated Enterprise RIS (Radiology Information System), VNA (Vendor Neutral Archive), and PACS (Picture Archiving and Communications System). Previously, the radiology imaging databases in the various hospitals and centres of AIIMS New Delhi were separate and independent systems. However, with the implementation of RIS VNA PACS, the entire radiology imaging system will be unified. This integration will replace departmental data silos with central healthcare enterprise databases, enabling the capture of data from any source and in any format. The simplified storage and access of imaging data will have a significant positive impact on patient care, as well as research and teaching efforts. Each year, a substantial number of individuals seek care at the MCH block, with approximately 570,000 outpatients and around 27,000 inpatients expected to benefit annually from the Foundation’s grant. The full impact of the imaging data management system will become more evident once it is fully implemented later this year. The Infosys Foundation takes pride in contributing to the establishment of public healthcare facilities at AIIMS, facilitating the delivery of critical and specialized care to patients. The lasting impact of this project will benefit generations to come as they witness and benefit from these advancements in healthcare. 3.2 Type 2 Diabetes Reversal Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a prevalent form of diabetes worldwide, necessitating medication and insulin therapy to manage blood sugar levels. However, what if we could halt the progression of diabetes without relying on medication or bariatric surgery? Research suggests that T2D patients can restore healthy blood sugar levels through lifestyle changes, dietary adjustments, and healthy weight loss. As part of its commitment to addressing the escalating burden of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) in India, Infosys Foundation aims to support T2D patients in enhancing their quality of life and mitigating the complications associated with the condition. The Foundation has partnered with the Association for Diabetes and Obesity Reversal (ADORE) to empower T2D patients to adopt healthy lifestyles and make dietary modifications that enable them to achieve and sustain normal blood sugar levels without medication. To realize this goal, Infosys Foundation has facilitated the establishment of two Diabetes Reversal Counseling Centers in Pune and Nagpur in November 2022 and December 2022, respectively. In August 2022, the Infosys Foundation Diabetes Care Program was launched in collaboration with ADORE. The project is scheduled to be completed by July 2025. As part of the Infosys Foundation Diabetes Care Program, ADORE successfully organized free HbA1c testing camps in Pune and Nagpur. These camps identified over 100 individuals with diabetes and 350 individuals with pre-diabetes. As of March 4, 2023, a total of 568 registered Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) patients have enrolled in the lifestyle modification program. 3.3 Upgradation of Infrastructure In fiscal year 2023, the Infosys Foundation extended its support to the Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences in Bengaluru. The Foundation’s assistance involved the provision of diagnostic and medical care equipment, enhancing the hospital’s capacity to meet the growing demand for care, including COVID and long COVID-related treatments. Specifically, the Foundation supplied the hospital with a cardiac CT (Computed Tomography) unit and a flat-panel cardiac cath lab. In 2021, the Foundation also undertook the construction of a 350-bed hospital block dedicated to the institute. With the addition of this block, the Jayadeva hospital’s total capacity for cardiac care expanded to 2,000 beds. In the year 2022 alone, the hospital successfully treated 68,902 inpatients. The medical team performed a total of 4,586 open heart surgeries, 28,555 coronary angiograms, and 54,371 cath lab procedures. These statistics highlight the crucial role played by the CT unit and cath lab, which are integral to the operations of the Jayadeva hospital. As patient numbers continue to rise, the acquisition of new equipment has become a necessity for the hospital. The cardiac CT unit plays a crucial role in the early detection of heart diseases and congenital conditions, particularly in children. On the other hand, the flat-panel cardiac cath lab facilitates essential procedures such as coronary angiograms, angioplasty, stenting, device closure, and pacemaker implantation. The implementation of these new units is expected to benefit a minimum of 9,600 patients annually, enabling enhanced diagnostic capabilities and improved treatment outcomes at the Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences. 4. Women Empowerment The welfare of women in the country has been a consistent focus for Infosys Foundation, which has undertaken numerous projects dedicated to women empowerment. This year, the Foundation has embarked on ambitious initiatives in this domain that are poised to revolutionize the opportunities available to women, enabling them to showcase their talents and capabilities within their communities and the nation as a whole. These projects represent significant game-changers in the pursuit of gender equality and women’s empowerment. 4.1 Infosys-GoSports Foundation Girls for Gold program The Girls for Gold program has a clear objective of creating an exclusive and high-performance excellence plan specifically tailored for junior and emerging female athletes. This will be achieved by facilitating access to world-class sporting expertise, establishing sports science centers, and providing support to academies across various sports. The program’s grant will cover a four-year period from November 2022 to October 2026. The allocated funds will be utilized for the following purposes: – Identifying top-notch academies and exceptional coaches in India, spanning at least six sports such as badminton, table tennis, weightlifting, boxing, athletics, and shooting. – Identifying and supporting the next generation of talented female athletes aged between 13 and 19 years. – Providing athlete scholarships, supporting coaches, and assisting academies to enhance athlete performance recognition. – Establishing a comprehensive sports science center that encompasses essential facilities like a recovery center, high-performance labs, and bio-mechanic laboratories. – Fostering education, research, advocacy, and outreach activities. – Undertaking selections, renewals, and due diligence processes. – Monitoring progress, implementing reporting mechanisms, and leveraging technology for effective program management. – Ensuring smooth operation and implementation of the program. The primary goal of this program is to develop a robust community of female athletes who consistently achieve international success, establish sustainable careers, and serve as role models for future generations of girls. Moreover, the program aims to cultivate a pipeline of capable leaders in the field of sports. It will also contribute to the establishment of professionally-run, world-class academies that prioritize systematic approaches and leverage technology to nurture a wide array of female sporting talents for the nation. 4.2 Infosys Foundation-Avanti Fellows Girls STEM Education Program With the backing of Infosys Foundation, Avanti Fellows launched the Girls STEM Education Program, aiming to offer free engineering and medical test preparation assistance to female students. In fiscal year 2023, the organization placed its focus on educating girls in various regions, including Delhi, Kerala, Telangana, Maharashtra, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Tripura, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Sikkim, and Nagaland. To equip the students with the necessary skills, the program provided them with 6-12 hours of intensive test preparation classes on a weekly basis, conducted outside regular school hours. The Avanti team diligently conducted weekly assessments, spanning 1-3 hours, to gauge the students’ learning levels and track their progress. These evaluations were comprehensive and diagnostic in nature, generating valuable data points that were utilized to customize the guidance and support needed for each student. Alongside the test preparation classes, the students were provided with JEE/NEET online learning resources, class recordings, mock tests, and orientation sessions. These resources aimed to maximize the utilization of Avanti’s technology platform, enabling students to access online sessions and weekly assessment tests effectively. Through these sessions and tests, students were equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to manifest their academic aspirations and pursue their desired careers. 4.3 Gender Equity Through Education Infosys Foundation is deeply committed to the empowerment of women and girls through educational initiatives and skill development programs. The collaborative effort between Infosys Foundation and CITTA Education Foundation India aims to provide quality education to students hailing from villages and hamlets in Sam, Salkha, and Kanoi regions of Rajasthan. Specifically, this program targets the students of Rajkumari Ratnavati Girls School in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan. The overarching goal is to educate and empower these girls, enabling them to become well-informed, courageous, competent, and empathetic global citizens. CITTA Education Foundation India, a non-profit organization, focuses on supporting underprivileged, economically-challenged, and marginalized communities residing in geographically remote areas of Rajasthan. Rajkumari Ratnavati Girls School is duly registered with the Board of Secondary Education Rajasthan (RBSC). This one-year program, commencing in March 2023, adopts an innovative and engaging approach to learning by integrating digital and activity-based methodologies. The program aims to foster conceptual clarity in foundational subjects, ensuring that the learning process is not only effective but also enjoyable for the students. By creating a vibrant and interactive learning environment, the program endeavors to instill a love for learning and engage the students actively in their educational journey. The joint venture between Infosys and CITTA Education Foundation India aims to enhance educational opportunities for girls in the region, with a strong focus on promoting gender equality, bridging the gender gap in education, and empowering girls to become self-reliant. The project endeavors to create a safe, supportive, positive, and inclusive learning environment for the girls, while equipping them with the necessary tools and resources to develop social and emotional skills. In addition to academic pursuits, the project emphasizes the importance of extracurricular activities, such as sports and handicrafts, to foster holistic development and enable the exploration of talents and interests. An essential aspect of the initiative involves promoting community involvement and engaging parents and community members in supporting girls’ education. To ensure the project’s effectiveness, a comprehensive survey conducted in collaboration with the district administration of Jaisalmer assessed the wealth index of over 400 families residing within a 20-kilometer radius. The survey findings informed the selection process, enabling the project to reach students from vulnerable and financially disadvantaged backgrounds. The program encompasses both academic and 21st-century skills training, enabling the girls to discover their inner strengths and focus on holistic development beyond mere academic success. The initiative will benefit 140 students across various grade levels, from classes 1 to 5. In addition to providing quality education, the girls will receive essential learning materials, uniforms, midday meals, and a convenient pick-up and drop-off facility. The classes are designed to be highly encouraging and interactive, with the aim of improving enrollment rates and promoting student retention. To leverage the benefits of technology in education, the project team will establish a digital library within the school premises. This initiative will introduce technology-enhanced learning, making the classroom environment more engaging for the students and familiarizing them with digital tools. The digital library will offer a range of resources, including e-books, educational videos, and digital games, to supplement traditional learning methods. By integrating digital literacy into the curriculum, the students will develop the essential skills needed for success in the 21st century. 5. Environmental Sustainability In recent times, the Infosys Foundation has intensified its efforts towards environmental initiatives, aiming to restore equilibrium that has been disrupted by pollution, mismanagement and depletion of natural resources, exacerbated climate change, and human-induced damage. 5.1 Restoring an Architectural and Green Heritage Infosys Foundation recognizes its responsibility towards future generations and believes in the restoration of heritage sites and water bodies. In the past, the Foundation has partnered with various organizations to restore significant heritage sites. This time, in collaboration with the Society for Advancement of Human Endeavor (SAHE) based in Telangana, the Foundation has undertaken a monumental task. One such site in focus is the Lingampet stepwell, known as Naganna Baavi. Historically, stepwells were constructed across India by royalty to provide water to the people and serve as shelters for travelers. However, with the advent of piped water and drilled wells, many of these magnificent structures were abandoned and fell into disrepair, becoming neglected and even serving as dumping grounds. Over the years, Naganna Baavi had suffered from neglect, leading to the growth of vegetation and trees within its premises. This deterioration weakened the structure of the five-level stepwell, each level being at least 20 feet high. The accumulation of silt and waste obstructed the aquifers, making it challenging to access the stepwell. Additionally, the intrusion of 30-year-old trees into the masonry and the lack of demarcation posed further challenges. Recognizing the value of the structure and its potential to enhance the lives of the local community, SAHE was invited by the Kamareddy Collectorate to restore Naganna Baavi. SAHE undertook the documentation of the project and appointed architects for the restoration, while Infosys Foundation provided vital support and funding. Dedicated volunteers from Infosys monitored the progress and supplied the necessary tools for this enormous undertaking. The restoration of Naganna Baavi holds numerous benefits. It will reactivate the aquifers and improve groundwater resources, directly benefiting approximately 20,000 locals in the area and revitalizing an entire ecosystem. With a capacity to hold over 18 lakh litres of water, the revival of the stepwell will also support the agricultural needs of farmers in the region. Furthermore, it aims to raise awareness among residents about the significance of water resources and promote their sustainable utilization. 5.2 Sustainable Transport Namma Metro, the metro rail transport system of Bengaluru, has become an integral and indispensable part of the city’s daily life. With its extensive 70-kilometer network, it serves a remarkable daily ridership of 380,000 people. Each day, these individuals contribute to reducing air pollution and carbon emissions, making a positive impact on the environment. It is a source of great pride for Infosys Foundation to be a significant partner of Namma Metro, actively involved in the construction of the Infosys Foundation Electronic City Station, an essential element of Phase 2 of the metro rail project. The decision of Infosys Foundation to support this metro rail project is rooted in its steadfast commitment to promoting environmental sustainability. By providing a seamless and time-efficient commute, the metro project has liberated countless travellers who were previously trapped in perpetual traffic congestion. The Infosys Foundation Electronic City Station serves as a vital transportation hub for thousands of professionals commuting to the bustling IT centre of Bengaluru. While the project faced delays due to the unfortunate COVID-19 pandemic after the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Foundation and BMRCL in 2018-19, work has now resumed and is nearing completion, showcasing the dedication and resilience of all involved parties. 6. Art and Culture The Museum of Art & Photography (MAP) in Bengaluru, established by the Art & Photography Foundation, is at the forefront of leveraging technology to bring arts and culture to the heart of society. Infosys Foundation, a firm believer in promoting art and preserving it for future generations, stands as a proud partner of MAP in this endeavor. The collaboration between Infosys Foundation and MAP began in 2020 when the Foundation became one of the founding patrons, providing crucial support and becoming a valued donor. This support primarily focused on the construction of the museum building in Bengaluru and the technological development of the digital museum, an encyclopedia, interactive website experiences, software visualizations, and exhibitions. On February 18, 2023, the museum opened its doors to the public. The Infosys Foundation Gallery hosts art exhibitions showcasing the finest works of renowned and emerging artists. Each exhibition spans three months and offers free access to unique and exquisite artworks. This art gallery serves as a platform to support artists and ensure that art enthusiasts can revel in the beauty of exceptional creations. Taking art beyond the confines of museums and galleries, the ongoing partnership project, initiated in September 2022 and scheduled for completion in August 2025, focuses on innovative museum experiences. With the Foundation’s support, MAP is creating wall-based three-dimensional (3D) holographic projectors, a digital platform to catalog the MAP collection, and state-of-the-art IT infrastructure for the new museum. Additionally, a user-friendly and captivating website is being developed, providing visitors with a virtual museum experience complete with comprehensive details of the collection, digital exhibitions, ongoing and upcoming events, blogs, articles, video series, and educational initiatives. Another significant aspect of the project is the creation of the MAP Academy Encyclopedia of Art (MAEA), an extensive and inclusive online resource featuring historical research on art from South Asia. This encyclopedia is freely accessible to all, promoting knowledge and understanding of the region’s artistic heritage. Furthermore, the project emphasizes comprehensive content creation, particularly for digital platforms. From exploring artificial intelligence and holographic technology to utilizing 3D representations, photogrammetry, virtual reality, and touch screens, the team continually seeks ways to enhance public engagement and enrich art experiences. Conclusion Infosys Foundation through its CSR projects has worked towards helping society and achieving sustainable development. It leverages its high tech background and implements projects which are tracked on a real-time basis and hence create lasting impact in the community."

    "article_content": "Government of India’s National Tele-Mental Health Programme has achieved a significant milestone, with the number of calls it has received since its launch in October 2022 seeking mental health support. The programme has received over 1 million (10 lakh) calls on its Tele-MANAS toll-free number, and is receiving an average of 3,500 calls per day, as per an announcement made by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The Tele MANAS toll-free helpline numbers 14416 or 1-800-891-4416 connects callers seeking support with mental health professionals from across India. “By linking existing mental health resources and establishing a comprehensive digital network, Tele-MANAS has become an essential platform for addressing the nation’s mental health needs,” as per a statement released by the ministry. Launched on World Mental Health Day The National Tele Mental Health Programme of India was inaugurated on the occasion of the World Mental Health Day on 10th October 2022. The purpose was to create a digital mental health ecosystem that will provide a boost to the existing mental healthcare services. This was conceptualised after an urgent need was felt for a digital mental health network in the wake of COVID-19. With 51 functioning Tele MANAS cells across the country, the service caters to over 3,500 calls daily in multiple languages. The platform not only connects mental health professionals with help seekers, the latter also get call-backs following up about the support that they have received. Number of callers growing The Tele-MANAS helpline has witnessed a steady increase in the number of callers, growing from around 12,000 in December 2022 to over 90,000 in May 2024. More number of people opening up on mental health issues and coming out to seek support reflects the growing awareness around mental health in India. The most common mental health concerns which have been reported include sadness, sleep disturbance, stress and anxiety, as revealed by the government. A sudden increase in calls related to exam stress can be witnessed during the exam season, to which counsellors offer supportive counselling and self-help strategies. The government is also making efforts to reach more students, especially adolescents in various educational institutes."

    "article_content": "In the day and age where children can name more celebrities and series over fruits and trees, it is not just a necessity but an imperative for us to educate ourselves about the environment and its functionality. So today we pick wetlands, not just because today, 2nd February is observed as World Wetlands Day but also because our nation is finally taking the long pending efforts to conserve its wetlands. Wetlands are more than Mangroves Mangroves have been much talked about and discussed for them to be very famous amongst everyone, but they are merely a part of an ecosystem called wetlands. The most saturated part of land, in which water is the primary factor controlling the environment of human, plant and animal lives are all wetlands. From lakes to mangroves to even man-made salt pans, wetlands are unique ecosystems that serve as a vital link between land and water. They play a crucial role in maintaining a balance in nature by providing a habitat for diverse plant and animal species. Additionally, wetlands act as natural sponges, absorbing excess rainwater and preventing flooding in surrounding areas. These areas also act as water purifiers, ensuring the water we use is clean and safe. Even though wetlands cover only 6% of earth, they inhabit around 40% of plants and animals. India’s Kidneys in Danger Wetlands, often referred to as the Earth’s kidneys, are facing a severe threat in India according to WWF India (World Wide Fund for Nature-India). Despite their crucial ecological role, many wetlands in the country are endangered due to human activities, urbanisation, and climate change. Encroachment, pollution from industrial and domestic sources, and unsustainable land-use practices have significantly degraded these vital ecosystems. Wetlands play a pivotal role in maintaining water balance by storing and regulating water flow. The loss of wetlands exacerbates water scarcity issues in various regions. Climate change further intensifies the challenges, with rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns affecting the health and resilience of wetland ecosystems. Threatened Wetlands in India Chilika Lake, Odisha: Asia’s largest brackish water lake faces threats from agricultural runoff, overfishing, and industrial pollution, endangering its biodiversity and the livelihoods of local communities. Dal Lake, Jammu and Kashmir: Urbanisation and improper waste management have led to the deterioration of Dal Lake, impacting its water quality and ecosystem health. Asan Conservation Reserve, Uttarakhand: This wetland is under threat due to habitat destruction and encroachment, posing a risk to the unique biodiversity it supports. What is India Doing? India was a part of the Ramsar Convention, held in Iran’s Ramsar city back in the early 70s. They set the framework for conservation of wetlands and India in a desperate effort to conserve its wetlands is listing it in the Ramsar List. With 80 wetlands already recognised in this list the latest 5 have been added just few days before the World Wetlands Day celebrations slated to happen at Madhya Pradesh, Indore’s Sirpur Lake. The five newly listed wetlands are – Ankasamudra Bird Conservation Reserve, Aghanashini Estuary, Magadi Kere Conservation Reserve from Karnataka and Karaivetti Bird Sanctuary and Longwood Shola Reserve Forest from Tamil Nadu. Out of the 80 listed wetlands in India, the maximum sites come from the state of Tamil Nadu (16 sites), followed by Uttar Pradesh (10 sites). The Ramsar Convention recognises the ecological importance of different wetland types and emphasises their value in terms of biodiversity, water resources, and overall environmental health. Therefore, both broader wetland ecosystems and specific components like marshes and swamps are considered within the scope of the Ramsar Convention. The goal is to protect and sustainably manage these diverse wetland environments for the benefit of present and future generations. The endangerment of wetlands in India is a pressing environmental issue that requires immediate attention and action. The loss of these vital ecosystems not only affects biodiversity but also contributes to water scarcity and climate change challenges. Through concerted efforts, it is possible to reverse the damage and ensure the sustainability of India’s wetlands for future generations."

    "article_content": "From individual choices to corporate initiatives – unraveling the challenges and solutions in India’s e-waste landscape. Can you imagine a day without technology? Keeping our phantom limb phones aside, switching off the television and wifi, no tabs, laptops or smart watches. These are just the addictive extensions of our entertainment requirements, but technology includes everything from our kitchen appliances to our technologically powered homes and even modern health care. So the simplest answer to that question is – NO! Technology is everywhere, in every aspect of our lives and doing a lot more for us than we can ever give credit for. But with the constant advancement, comes the constant need to upgrade our devices. While there is no guilt in upgrading our gadgets as per our needs, there are a few questions, we as citizens of this world, must ask ourselves. Do I really need this upgrade or can I still continue to use my old device? Am I willing to “repair” and “donate” my old gadgets? If it is beyond repair then do I “know how” to responsibly dispose of them? According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), India generates approximately 62 million tons (MT) of electronic waste in a year, making it the third largest e-waste producer globally. The report further indicates a concerning annual growth rate of 21%, signalling a pressing need for effective waste management strategies. Spotlight on boAt While there are some steps we can take on an individual level to reduce the hazards of e-waste, it is important to understand the need for corporations to take bold steps as well. Imagine Marketing Ltd’s boAt has become a go-to brand for most Indians looking for affordable gadgets. But along with that and the marketing of their gadgets being “made in India”, they are also focusing on responsible disposal of their e-waste. In partnership with Namo eWaste Management Ltd, boAt runs a recycling programme, urging its consumers to dispose of all their unwanted gadgets at their designated e-waste collection centres. Operating since 2014 Namo eWaste Management offers comprehensive, complete and responsible recycling services to various brands and in the year 2023 itself they have managed to recycle approximately 7 million kgs of electronic waste in India. Why Responsible Disposal An important facet of the e-waste issue in India is the prevalent involvement of the informal sector in its management. Many rag-pickers, often working in hazardous conditions, engage in manual dismantling and extraction of valuable materials from discarded electronics. This informal recycling poses health and environmental risks, as improper disposal methods can lead to the release of harmful substances. E-waste contains toxic substances such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, posing severe risks to both the environment and human health. Improper disposal methods, including burning or dumping electronic waste in landfills, can result in soil and water contamination. Additionally, exposure to these hazardous materials during the recycling process can lead to respiratory and other health issues among workers. Adopting Circular Economy Recognising the urgency of the e-waste problem, the Indian government has implemented the E-Waste Management Rules, 2016, aimed at regulating the handling, recycling, and disposal of electronic waste. However, effective enforcement and awareness are crucial for the success of these regulations. When precious metals like cobalt, lithium, palladium, copper and gold are extracted responsibly from old electronic devices, they can be re-used in the manufacture of new ones. India has a prevalent pattern of linear economy, where products are made and disposed of. Adopting a circular economy means producing and then responsibly recycling the products after their life cycle completion. The collaboration of boAt with Namo eWaste Management Ltd is a small step towards adopting a circular economy. As India continues its technological journey, it must simultaneously address the growing issue of e-waste. Sustainable practices, responsible consumption, and robust waste management infrastructure are essential to mitigate the environmental and health impacts associated with the disposal of electronic devices. It is imperative for individuals, industries, and policymakers to collaborate in finding innovative solutions to ensure that technological progress does not come at the cost of our environment."

    "article_content": "On World Consumer Right Day we delve into three case studies to understand the workings of consumer rights and redressal in India. Every year on March 15th, the world celebrates World Consumer Rights Day, a day dedicated to raising awareness about consumer rights and advocating for fair practices in the marketplace. In India, this day holds significant importance as it serves as a reminder of the essential rights bestowed upon every consumer and the ongoing efforts to protect and uphold these rights. The Essence of World Consumer Day World Consumer Rights Day traces its origins back to March 15, 1962, when President John F. Kennedy first addressed the issue of consumer rights. Since then, this day has been observed globally to emphasise the importance of consumer protection and welfare. In India, where a diverse population engages in various economic activities, the significance of World Consumer Day cannot be overstated. It serves as a platform to educate consumers about their rights, promote responsible consumption, and highlight the need for fair trade practices. Consumer Rights in India Consumer rights in India are safeguarded by the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which replaced the earlier Consumer Protection Act of 1986. These rights include: Right to Safety: Consumers have the right to be protected against the marketing of goods and services that are hazardous to health or life. Right to Information: Consumers have the right to be informed about the quality, quantity, potency, purity, standard, and price of goods or services. Right to Choose: Consumers have the right to choose from a variety of goods and services at competitive prices. Right to be Heard: Consumers have the right to be heard and to seek redressal for grievances regarding the purchase of goods or services. Right to Redressal: Consumers have the right to seek redressal against unfair trade practices or restrictive trade practices. Right to Consumer Education: Consumers have the right to be educated about their rights and responsibilities as consumers. Consumer Protection Mechanisms in India The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, strengthened the legal framework for consumer protection in India. It established the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) to promote, protect, and enforce consumer rights. The Act also introduced the concept of product liability, holding manufacturers, sellers, and service providers accountable for defective products or deficient services. In addition to legislative measures, consumer forums at the district, state, and national levels provide a platform for consumers to seek redressal for their grievances. These forums offer a speedy and cost-effective mechanism for resolving consumer disputes. Let’s understand the essence of consumer rights in India through three compelling case studies. Case Study 1: Bournvita vs Revant Himatsingka Influencer Revant Himatsingka also known as FoodPharmer took to social media to highlight the high sugar content in health drink Bournvita. Explained through the brand’s tagline, “Tayyari Jeet Ki” (Preparation for Victory) positioned in the children’s health drink category, ironically has extremely high sugar content. On which the influencer suggested a more apt tagline change to, “Tayyari Diabetes Ki” (Preparation for Diabetes). This sparked many reactions by netizens and soon the video became viral. The brand got the influencer to take down the video, eventually suspending the account as well. But a group of 8 doctors and nutritionists did further research and validated the influencers claims. Mondelez International, the parent company of Bournvita dismissed the claims as “unscientific”. Finally the Indian Government’s National Commission For Protection Of Child Right (NCPCR) intervened and asked Bournvita to withdraw their misleading ads or serve fines. This fiasco led Bournvita to reduce the sugar content by 14.4 percent. The Bournvita controversy is a prime example of consumers “Right to Safety” where they have the right to be protected against the marketing of goods and services that are hazardous to health or life. Case Study 2: State Bank of India vs Rajesh Sakre Tea Vendor Rajesh Sakre had Rs. 20,000 in his State Bank of India account and had withdrawn Rs.10,800. But on his next visit to the ATM he realised that all his money was gone. On asking the bank authorities, he received no satisfactory answer and got blamed instead. Then he went to the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (DCDRF) and since he couldn’t afford a lawyer he argued the case himself. The court ruled in his favour and ordered State Bank of India to return the Rs. 9,200 with 6% interest, Rs. 10,000 as compensation for mental anguish caused by the issue and Rs. 2,000 for legal expenses. This case showcases a consumer’s “Right to Redressal” where they have the right to seek redressal against unfair trade practices or restrictive trade practices. Case Study 3: Pepsi vs Rajesh Rajan Ahmedabad’s Rajesh Rajan bought the famous aerated drink Pepsi from a local store and found a packet of gutka (tobacco) floating in it. He sent a legal notice to the company immediately and approached a State Consumers Dispute Redressal Forum (CDRF) claiming that there was a deficiency in service that could have caused a health hazard to him. He demanded compensation of ₹5 lakh for the same. The consumer forum passed an order in favour of Rajesh, asking the company to pay Rs. 4000 for compensation and Rs. 8 for the Pepsi he purchased. He moved the State CDRF and asked for a higher compensation stating that Rs. 4008 was too low as he had spent Rs. 500 for sample testing itself. Finally the commission passed an order asking Pepsi to pay Rs. 20,000 as compensation and Rs. 2000 towards cost, finding Rajesh’s argument reasonable. Complicated, Uncomplicated or In-between? To answer the question stated at the beginning, it is complicated to seek redressal for consumer rights in India, since there are many government bodies involved in the ruling of a case. But it is also less complicated since sometimes even taking up to social media can grab the attention of the government and the concerned company. Consumer Rights in India are an in-between process depending on the perseverance of the consumer. Having said that, the growing misleading ads in the country are definitely amounting to stronger actions from individuals and autonomous bodies alike. On World Consumer Rights Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to protecting and promoting consumer rights in India. By empowering consumers with knowledge, advocating for fair trade practices, and fostering a culture of accountability, we can create a marketplace that is transparent, inclusive, and conducive to the welfare of all stakeholders. Through these case studies, we witness the tangible impact of consumer rights in India striving towards a marketplace where consumer rights are respected, upheld, and celebrated."

    "article_content": "As India marks World Environment Day, the recent election results have stirred a sense of anticipation, coupled with skepticism, regarding the promised environmental reforms. While the electorate’s concern for sustainability is evident, there remains a palpable gap between political pledges and tangible action on the ground. The ruling party’s manifesto paints a promising picture of ecological governance, rooted in traditional Indian wisdom and the principles of sustainable development. However, amidst the rhetoric of sacredness of nature and integration of ecological security into development, questions linger about the feasibility and sincerity of these commitments. Outlined below are the key environmental reforms promised by the ruling party: 1. National Environment Policy: A comprehensive policy will be introduced, striking a balance between development needs and the preservation of natural resources, ensuring adherence to sustainable development principles. 2. Ministry for Ecological Security: The Ministry of Environment and Forests will be restructured into the Ministry for Ecological Security to prioritize environmental concerns at the highest levels of governance. 3. Sustainable City Development: Emphasis will be placed on urban planning, safe drinking water, waste management, and reducing resource consumption intensity to promote sustainable urban ecosystems. 4. Rivers and Groundwater Management: Robust strategies will be implemented to manage river waters and groundwater sources effectively, including pollution control measures and mandatory sewage treatment plants. 5. Environmental Education: Environmental studies will be integrated into educational curricula at all levels to instill a sense of reverence for nature and empower future generations to protect ecosystems. 6. Empowerment of Local Self-Governments: Local self-governments will be empowered to implement the National Environment Policy, ensuring community participation in environmental conservation efforts. 7. Technological Innovation: Investment in eco-friendly products, research, and development will drive a green industrial revolution, addressing pressing environmental challenges. 8. Protection of Indigenous Rights: Indigenous communities’ rights over forest resources and land will be safeguarded, with stringent regulations on hazardous waste imports and afforestation initiatives. 9. Ban on Import of Hazardous Chemical Wastes: Import of hazardous chemical wastes for recycling or dumping will be banned to prevent environmental degradation. 10. Reducing Non-Biodegradable Packaging: Efforts will be made to minimize the use of non-biodegradable materials for packaging by the consumer non-durable products industry. 11. Forest Conservation: Forest and grazing areas will be protected, and afforestation policies will be adopted within a given timeframe to prevent deforestation. 12. Afforestation Policies: Afforestation initiatives will be undertaken to convert degraded forests, wasteland, and marginal land into quality forests. 13. Protection of Marine Life: Exploitation of offshore resources, especially marine life, by large trawlers will be curtailed to preserve marine ecosystems. 14. Incentives for Eco-Friendly Products: Incentives will be provided to manufacturers of eco-friendly products to promote sustainable consumption. 15. Restrictions on Tourism-Related Projects: Tourism projects that disturb the environment will not be sanctioned to prevent environmental degradation. 16. Clean-Up of River Systems: Major efforts will be made to clean up river systems and other water bodies to restore their ecological balance. 17. Disaster Management: Machinery for prevention, integration, and management of national disasters will be developed to mitigate environmental risks. 18. Encouragement of Energy Conservation: Energy conserving techniques will be encouraged across all areas of production to reduce environmental impact. 19. Promotion of Environmentally Sound Practices: Environment-related issues and eco-technology will be promoted for application in agriculture, industry, and the services sector. As India stands at the crossroads of environmental transformation, the gap between promises and implementation looms large. The onus lies not just on the government but also on civil society, academia, and the private sector to hold policymakers accountable and ensure that environmental sustainability remains a top priority. On World Environment Day, India must move beyond mere symbolism and rhetoric to chart a path towards tangible environmental progress. The road ahead is fraught with challenges, but it is also paved with opportunities to build a greener, more resilient future for generations to come."

    "article_content": "The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) a national level medical entrance examination in India have ignited a firestorm of controversy, with allegations ranging from cheating to paper leaks. The National Testing Agency (NTA) finds itself under scrutiny as concerns mount over the integrity of the examination process. Amidst calls for a re-examination and demands for accountability, the fallout from the NEET UG 2024 results continues to reverberate with on-ground students protests and across social media platforms. This year, a staggering 67 students have been awarded the coveted AIR 1 i.e All India Rank 1 in the NEET exam, signifying a perfect score of 720/ 720. This starkly contrasts with previous 5 years, where only 2 or 4 students attained this distinction. The sudden surge in top performers has raised suspicions among stakeholders, prompting calls for an inquiry into the evaluation process. Adding to the skepticism is the revelation that 6 out of the 67 students who secured Rank 1 hail from a single examination centre in Haryana. This clustering of high achievers from a specific location raises questions about the fairness and impartiality of the examination administration. Coming to the second rand holders with 718/720 and 719/720 in this year’s result show technical faults. NEET exams typically have a system of providing 4+ marks for right answers and -1 mark for wrong answers, and by that standard anyone who is unable to secure top marks would fall at securing either a score of 715/720 or 716/720 marks. On this the NTA officials said that some students received grace marks since they did not get sufficient time to complete their papers. But how many marks were allotted against how much of time loss was not mentioned clearly. Just days before the NEET exam, reports surfaced of a purported cheating scandal involving individuals from Gujarat. Allegedly, these individuals paid hefty sums (10 Lakhs) to fraudulently secure passage in the exam. The involvement of an education consultancy owner (Parshuram Roy) and a school teacher (Tushar Bhatt) has only added fuel to the controversy. The declaration of NEET 2024 results 10 days prior i.e from 14th June to 4th June amidst Election Result fervour have sparked further speculations. Parents and Students believe that this was strategically done to hide the shortcomings in this year’s result with the magnitude of Election Results. Amidst the uproar surrounding the NEET 2024 results, the NTA faces mounting pressure to address the concerns raised by students and parents alike. Calls for a thorough investigation into alleged irregularities persist, with many clamouring for transparency and accountability in the examination system. As the controversy deepens, the fate of thousands of aspiring medical students hangs in the balance, awaiting resolution and justice."

    "article_content": "The geographical location of Israel is not very favorable for development and progress. Despite that, the country has flourished tremendously. How did it make this possible? The answer is sustainability. In Israel, sustainable development is not a frill or a buzzword; it is a necessity for improving the well-being of current and future generations. One of the reasons Israel places such a high value on the SDGs and the activities they spawn is because of this. Israel the Start-up Nation Israel has a vibrant tech sector that accounts for 35 to 40 per cent of its total GDP. The sector has earned the country the title of Start-up Nation, especially because of its sustainability solutions in various fields including communication, internet, medical systems, agriculture, biotechnology, security, water desalination, wastewater treatment and recycling, water management, digital printing and more. Israel’s Solutions for Water Scarcity Water Scarcity has long plagued the Middle East. Despite having scant natural resources, Israelis have found ways to deal with the problem through desalination, irrigation, and recycling. Israel has not only solved its own problem by assuring a reliable and safe supply for its citizens, but it has also established itself as a major international distributor of water technology. According to a 2016 survey, Israel recycles 87 percent of its wastewater, with Spain coming in second with 20 percent. Israel also pioneered drip irrigation technology, which is said to help feed nearly one billion people by reducing a plant’s water consumption by up to 90%. The $2.2 billion in related technology exported by Israeli companies each year has played a significant role in guaranteeing clean water access in developing countries. This idea is amazing for a country with a population of only nine million people. Israel’s Vision of Leaving No One Behind Israel’s mission is to continue to develop its innovative culture and to extend it to all those in need on our globe, in order to put the noble concept of “leaving no one behind” into practise. To that end, Israel is investing in innovation both at home and abroad to ensure that no one is left behind. For example, the Israel Innovation Authority collaborated with a number of other government agencies to develop custom R&D assistance tracks. The GCI Grand Challenges Program, which focuses on humanitarian health, agritech, and water challenges in developing countries, the Assistive Technology for the Disabled Program, which aims to improve the quality of life for the disabled and make their integration into society easier, and the Diverse Startups Program, which supports ultra-Orthodox and minority entrepreneurs, are just a few examples. MNCs Collaborating to access the Sustainable Solutions by Israel Multinational firms are also paying attention to Israeli innovation when it comes to sourcing solutions to support new climate change adaption tactics. L’Oreal, one of the world’s largest cosmetics businesses, announced a multi-year research and technology relationship with Israel-based BreezoMeter, a source of environmental information regarding air quality, at the end of last year. Their collaboration intends to find new insights into how the environment impacts skin aging and, as a result, give consumers new services that can help them with their skin needs anywhere in the world, including customized routines and lifestyle guidance. Global online fashion retailers ASOS and Fashion-Enter Ltd. have been partnering with Israeli company Kornit Digital since May 2021 to explore the adoption of Kornit’s direct-to-fabric, digital-textile printing solutions, with the fashion industry accounting for about 8-10% of global carbon emissions and nearly 20% of wastewater. Kornit’s technology eliminates water waste, reduces energy consumption, and reduces waste from the overproduction of fashion apparel goods. On the clean mobility and transportation front, Hitachi is collaborating with REE Automotive of Israel to advance EV manufacturing at scale using REE’s flat and modular electric vehicle chassis. e-Mobility Power (eMP), Japan’s top provider of electric vehicle charging, has chosen Driivz to migrate and consolidate its complete network of over 27,000 chargers onto the Driivz end-to-end EV charging and smart energy management software platform. Gilbarco Veeder Root, based in the United States, purchased Driivz for $200 million in December 2021. Similarly, Mercedes-Benz announced an agreement with UBQ Materials earlier this month to use the Israeli company’s thermoplastic components, which were transformed from landfill waste, in all of its VISION EQXX all-electric cars. Conclusion Israel is leading the world with the example of sustainability and development being on the same side rather than opposites. The world can learn a lot from this and adopt the methods and technologies designed by the country to ensure the fulfillment of Sustainable Development Goals."

    "article_content": "In the intricate world of international trade agreements, where economic interests often take centre stage, a surprising twist has occurred that underscores the growing influence of environmental concerns. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), a groundbreaking trade pact involving thirteen nations, has encountered an unexpected obstacle—an anti-whaling provision that has thrown the entire agreement into uncertainty. This clash of interests between economic cooperation and environmental conservation serves as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding global diplomacy, shedding light on the delicate balance between pursuing economic growth and safeguarding the planet’s natural resources. As nations grapple with these conflicting priorities, the fate of the IPEF hangs in the balance, embodying the broader challenge of harmonizing economic aspirations with environmental imperatives on the world stage. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) has emerged as a significant trade pact involving thirteen countries, aiming to forge economic collaboration and shared benefits among nations bordering the Pacific Ocean. Announced in Tokyo in May 2022, the IPEF brings together nations such as Australia, India, Japan, the United States, and more, constituting a substantial 40% of the world’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Beyond its economic implications, the IPEF assumes geopolitical importance by strengthening the United States’ presence in the Asia-Pacific region amid rising tensions with China. It aims to standardize labour rights, prioritize clean energy, and enhance global supply chains. The Whaling Conundrum and the Anti-Whaling Provision However, the IPEF’s progress has hit an unexpected roadblock—environmental concerns, particularly the issue of whaling, have cast doubt on its future. Central to this conundrum is the anti-whaling language embedded within the agreement, designed to curb the practice. Japan, a vital participant in the IPEF, has categorically labelled this provision a “deal-breaker,” throwing the trade agreement’s prospects into uncertainty. Japan’s connection to whaling dates back decades. Despite the global shift away from whaling due to conservation concerns, Japan continued this practice under the guise of scientific research, often followed by commercial sales of whale meat. While being a longstanding member of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), Japan’s actions sparked international criticism and tension. This reached a turning point in 2018 when Japan withdrew from the IWC, signalling its intention to expand its domestic whaling industry. This decision underscored Japan’s resolve to uphold its traditions and assert control over its resources, even if it clashed with global conservation efforts. Embracing Environmental Priorities Amidst Economic Ambitions Amidst the fervour of negotiations and geopolitical dynamics, a silver lining emerges from the impasse surrounding the anti-whaling provision in the IPEF. This discord underscores a significant shift in global consciousness—an increasing willingness to prioritize environmental concerns over immediate economic gains. The potential removal of the anti-whaling language to salvage the trade agreement brings forth a powerful narrative. It signifies that nations are not only recognizing the urgency of environmental preservation but also acknowledging that safeguarding our planet’s biodiversity and ecosystems carries profound importance. This shift stands as a testament to the growing influence of environmental movements, even in the face of lucrative economic opportunities. This willingness to challenge economic benefits in favour of environmental protection is a heartening development. It showcases a collective recognition that the consequences of unchecked environmental degradation transcend short-term profits. This acknowledgement reveals a deeper understanding that preserving the world’s natural resources is not merely an option but a responsibility that transcends national boundaries. While diplomatic complexities persist and nations grapple with reconciling their interests, the fact that environmental considerations are at the forefront of such negotiations is a step forward. It’s a realization that policies and agreements must harmonize with the long-term welfare of our planet and its inhabitants. This paradigm shift aligns with a global sentiment that seeks to place the environment on equal footing with economic prosperity. In conclusion, the impasse over the anti-whaling provision in the IPEF serves as a poignant example of prioritizing environmental values despite the allure of economic gains. It signifies that nations are increasingly willing to stand up for the preservation of the planet’s resources, even when faced with lucrative trade opportunities. As environmental considerations gain prominence in international discourse, they pave the way for a future where the pursuit of economic growth is balanced by a commitment to safeguarding the environment for generations to come."

    "title": "Global Water Crisis: 25 Nations Grapple with Unprecedented Water Stress as Economic Impact Mounts - The CSR Journal",
    "published_date": "2023-08-17T11:14:00+00:00",

    "article_content": "Water scarcity has evolved into a critical global concern, casting its shadow over numerous regions worldwide. A convergence of factors, including rapid population growth, escalating urbanization, unchecked industrialization, the looming spectre of climate change, and ineffective water management practices, has coalesced to give rise to the widespread spectre of water scarcity. The ramifications of this crisis are profound, stretching across society and the environment, necessitating immediate attention and comprehensive solutions. In light of data unveiled from the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, a dire water emergency has taken centre stage on the world’s agenda. A staggering 25 nations, representing a quarter of the planet’s population, find themselves entangled in the web of exceptionally heightened annual water stress. On a global scale, a staggering 4 billion people, constituting an astounding 50% of the world’s inhabitants, endure water stress for at least one month per year. Projections indicate that this worrisome figure could balloon to encompass nearly 60% of the global population by the year 2050. The Economic Ramifications of Water Scarcity A sombre economic forecast accompanies these statistics. The report posits that a staggering $70 trillion in GDP, equating to 31% of the world’s total GDP, will be exposed to severe water stress by the year 2050. This forecast stands in stark contrast to the $15 trillion (24% of global GDP) exposure recorded in 2010. Poignantly, the lion’s share of this economic vulnerability will rest upon the shoulders of just four nations: India, Mexico, Egypt, and Turkey, which collectively will account for over half of the exposed GDP in 2050, as per the quadrennial report’s projections. Delving deeper into the report’s findings, it becomes apparent that the repercussions of water scarcity are far from uniform across the globe. A notable 25 nations, harbouring a significant portion of the world’s population, grapple with the harsh reality of acute water stress on a yearly basis. Among this group, nations like Bahrain, Cyprus, Kuwait, Lebanon, and Oman bear the brunt of the crisis, facing vulnerability even during brief drought spells. This underscores the urgency of devising adaptable and resilient water management strategies to avert potential disasters. Unsurprisingly, the regions that find themselves at the epicentre of this water scarcity crisis are primarily concentrated in the Middle East and North Africa, where a staggering 83% of the population contends with the burdens of extremely high water stress. Moreover, in South Asia, a substantial 74% of the population shares a similar fate. The magnitude of this challenge is encapsulated in the words of Samantha Kuzma, Aqueduct data lead from WRI’s water program and one of the report’s authors, who laments, “Water is arguably our most important resource on the planet, and yet we’re not managing it in a way that reflects that. I’ve been working in water for close to 10 years, and unfortunately, the story has been the same almost the entire 10 years.” Call for Action As the crisis deepens, the need for swift and decisive action becomes more pronounced. Viable and economically feasible solutions lie within reach, awaiting implementation. However, the linchpin lies in the commitment demonstrated by political leaders and the strategic allocation of financial resources. The imperative of marshalling these forces cannot be overstated, for they hold the key to steering the world away from the precipice of an impending water catastrophe. In the face of such a multifaceted crisis, a comprehensive approach is non-negotiable. First and foremost, sustainable water management practices need to be integrated into the fabric of policies and regulations at both national and international levels. This encompasses everything from responsible water use in agriculture and industry to proactive leak detection and efficient distribution systems. In parallel, investing in water infrastructure is pivotal. Retrofitting existing systems for greater efficiency, developing new infrastructure that capitalizes on technological advancements, and prioritizing water recycling and desalination initiatives can all contribute to alleviating the strain on existing water resources. Furthermore, public awareness campaigns and educational initiatives are crucial components of the solution. Communities must be empowered with knowledge about responsible water use and conservation practices. These initiatives can be particularly effective in urban areas where large populations can make a tangible impact on water demand through conscious behavioural changes. Equally important is international collaboration. The interconnectedness of water resources transcends borders, necessitating collective efforts to address shared challenges. Collaborative research, resource-sharing, and technology transfer can facilitate a more harmonized approach to managing and conserving water resources on a global scale. In conclusion, the spectre of water scarcity casts a long shadow over the world’s future. The complex interplay of population dynamics, urban expansion, industrial growth, climate volatility, and mismanagement has led us to a critical juncture. However, this crisis is not insurmountable. By prioritizing sustainable practices, investing in innovative solutions, fostering public awareness, and embracing international cooperation, humanity can rewrite the narrative of water scarcity into one of resilience and security. The time to act is now, for the legacy we leave for generations to come hinges on the choices we make in the face of this defining challenge."

    "article_content": "The G20 member nations united in their commitment to global cooperation by adopting the New Delhi Declaration during the G20 Leaders’ Summit. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as the chair of the G20 under India’s presidency, emphasised the significance of this achievement, praising the hard work of the team that facilitated consensus. PM Modi conveyed his delight, stating, “I have received good news. Due to the hard work of our team, consensus has been built on New Delhi G20 Leaders’ Summit Declaration. My proposal is to adopt this leadership declaration. I announce to adopt this declaration. On this occasion, I congratulate my Sherpa, ministers, who worked hard for it and made it possible.” Amitabh Kant, India’s Sherpa to G20, elaborated on the declaration’s focus, which centred on robust, sustainable growth, accelerating progress toward sustainable development goals, promoting green development pacts, and upholding multilateralism. The New Delhi G20 Leaders’ Summit Declaration, themed ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,’ strongly underscores the importance of addressing global challenges while nurturing robust, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth. Here are the key highlights and commitments made by the G20 member nations in the declaration: Fostering Peace and Prosperity In the New Delhi Declaration, the G20 leaders made a resounding commitment to global peace and prosperity. This was particularly evident in their stance on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The declaration emphasised the need for nations to adhere to the Principles and Purposes of the United Nations Charter, which are foundational to maintaining international peace and security. By calling for refraining from the threat or use of force for territorial acquisition, the G20 member nations demonstrated their unwavering dedication to peaceful conflict resolution. Furthermore, the declaration unequivocally denounced the use or threat of nuclear weapons as inadmissible. This strong stance reflects the G20’s commitment to global disarmament efforts and ensuring that nuclear weapons are never again used as tools of aggression. In doing so, the G20 nations echoed the sentiments previously expressed by Prime Minister Modi in 2022 when he stated, “this is not an era of war.” It sends a powerful message of unity and commitment to a world free from the spectre of nuclear conflict. Unlocking Strong, Sustainable, Balanced, and Inclusive Growth The New Delhi Declaration acknowledges the global economic disparities exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In recognition of the uneven global recovery, the G20 member nations committed to implementing well-calibrated macroeconomic and structural policies. These policies aim to strike a delicate balance between safeguarding vulnerable populations and promoting equitable economic growth. The declaration’s emphasis on enhancing macroeconomic and financial stability is crucial for ensuring that nations are better prepared to weather economic shocks and uncertainties. Addressing the cost-of-living crisis is another paramount concern addressed in the declaration. As economies strive to recover, the G20 recognizes that the well-being of their citizens hinges on addressing the rising costs of living. By committing to implement policies that alleviate this crisis, the G20 seeks to create an environment where economic prosperity is accessible to all segments of society. Moreover, the document acknowledges the vital role played by the private sector and enterprises in driving sustainable economic transformations. This recognition highlights the importance of public-private partnerships in achieving the ambitious goals set forth in the declaration. It signifies a collaborative approach toward economic growth that involves governments and businesses working hand in hand to build a more prosperous future for all. Trade for Growth The G20 member nations understand the pivotal role of international trade in promoting global economic growth. The declaration reaffirms their commitment to a rules-based, non-discriminatory, fair, open, inclusive, equitable, sustainable, and transparent multilateral trading system. At its core, this system relies on the World Trade Organization (WTO) to ensure that trade is conducted on a level playing field, free from discriminatory practices. Furthermore, the G20 leaders expressed their support for policies that leverage trade and investment as drivers of growth and prosperity. By doing so, they seek to harness the potential of global trade to stimulate economic development and job creation. The commitment to discouraging protectionism and eliminating market-distorting practices underscores the G20’s dedication to creating an environment conducive to trade and investment, where nations can prosper together. Achieving Sustainable Development Goals The G20 member nations are acutely aware of the urgency of addressing global challenges, particularly in the realm of sustainable development. To this end, they expressed their dedication to taking collective action for the effective and timely implementation of the G20 2023 Action Plan to Accelerate Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sustainable development lies at the heart of the G20’s agenda. This commitment reaffirms their resolve to combat poverty, promote environmental sustainability, and ensure inclusive and equitable development for all. It recognises that the SDGs are not mere aspirational goals but concrete targets that demand coordinated efforts and action on a global scale. Human Capital Development Human capital development is an essential component of sustainable growth, and the New Delhi Declaration reflects this understanding. The document emphasizes the importance of eliminating hunger and malnutrition, underlining the significance of global food security and nutrition. In this context, the G20 aligns itself with the G20 Deccan High-Level Principles on Food Security and Nutrition 2023, which provide a roadmap for addressing food insecurity and malnutrition. Moreover, delivering quality education and ensuring access to education for all is pivotal to human capital development. The G20 member nations recognize that education is a cornerstone of social and economic progress. They commit to creating more inclusive, equitable, and high-quality educational systems, which include skill training programs for vulnerable populations. By doing so, the G20 aims to empower individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to participate fully in the global economy. Green Development Pact In the face of mounting environmental challenges, the New Delhi Declaration underscores the importance of environmentally sustainable and inclusive economic growth and development. The G20 leaders recognize that policies and actions taken today have far-reaching consequences for future generations and the planet. The declaration commits member nations to adopting holistic and balanced approaches that prioritize environmental sustainability. This means taking into account the impact of policies and initiatives on the environment and striving for a harmonious coexistence between economic development and ecological preservation. It represents a commitment to safeguarding the planet’s natural resources and ensuring that future generations inherit a sustainable and thriving environment. Macroeconomic Risks from Climate Change and Transition Pathways The New Delhi Declaration acknowledges the significant macroeconomic costs associated with climate change. It highlights the economic risks posed by climate-related events and the need for proactive measures to mitigate these risks. This recognition underscores the G20’s commitment to addressing climate change as an economic imperative. The declaration emphasizes the importance of international dialogue and cooperation in tackling climate change. It recognizes that climate action requires not only sound policies but also financial support, particularly for developing countries. By emphasizing timely policy action consistent with country-specific circumstances, the G20 member nations signal their commitment to a just transition toward a sustainable and low-carbon economy. Climate and Sustainable Finance The G20 nations are cognizant of the critical role that finance plays in addressing climate change and supporting sustainable development. The declaration welcomes the recommendations of the Sustainable Finance Working Group (SFWG) to mobilize resources for climate finance. This includes financing initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting countries in their transition to more sustainable practices. While recognizing that each nation faces unique challenges, the G20 commits to considering country-specific circumstances when mobilizing sustainable finance. This approach ensures that financial support is tailored to the needs and capacities of individual countries, facilitating a more effective response to climate change. Ocean-Based Economy The G20 member nations reaffirmed their commitment to the preservation, protection, and restoration of the world’s oceans and marine ecosystems. This commitment is particularly crucial given the alarming state of the world’s oceans, including issues such as overfishing, marine pollution, and habitat destruction. The declaration also emphasized the sustainable use of ocean resources, recognizing that oceans are a source of livelihood for many communities and play a vital role in maintaining global ecosystems. Furthermore, the G20 leaders expressed their commitment to making progress toward the 2025 UN Ocean Conference. This signifies their intent to actively contribute to international efforts aimed at safeguarding the oceans and their biodiversity. Ending Corruption and Ensuring Integrity In addition to the thematic commitments, the New Delhi Declaration also addresses the critical issue of ending corruption. The G20 nations reaffirmed their commitment to fostering integrity and transparency in governance. This commitment is crucial for building trust in public institutions and ensuring that resources are used efficiently and equitably. India’s Ambitious G20 Presidency Prime Minister Modi proudly declared that India’s G20 presidency has been the most ambitious in the history of the summit. He highlighted the substantial outcomes achieved during this presidency, citing a total of 112 outcomes and presidency documents. This represents more than double the substantive work of previous presidencies. Other Initiatives: Beyond the New Delhi Declaration, India announced several other initiatives designed to address pressing global challenges: 1. Global Biofuel Alliance: India called on G20 nations to increase the global blend of ethanol with petrol to 20 per cent. This initiative reflects a commitment to sustainable and renewable energy sources, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. 2. G20 Satellite Mission for Environment and Climate Observation: This proposal demonstrates India’s dedication to leveraging space technology for environmental monitoring and climate research. Such initiatives can enhance our understanding of climate change and support informed policy decisions. 3. Green Credit Initiative: This initiative is geared toward promoting sustainable and environmentally friendly financial practices. By incentivizing green investments and sustainable financing, the G20 seeks to accelerate the transition to a greener economy. In conclusion, the New Delhi Declaration and the G20 Leaders’ Summit mark a significant step toward global cooperation and addressing pressing global challenges. The commitments made in the declaration span a wide range of crucial issues, from peace and prosperity to sustainable development, environmental conservation, and climate action. India’s ambitious presidency has added momentum to these efforts, demonstrating the G20’s commitment to shaping a better future for all nations and generations to come."

    "article_content": "The International Day of Peace, observed annually on September 21st, is a momentous occasion to reflect on the importance of peace and its significance in a world fraught with conflicts, tensions, and unrest. Established by the United Nations (UN) in 1981, this day serves as a global reminder of the imperative to strive for a more peaceful and harmonious world. One of the critical aspects of maintaining international peace and security is the role of the UN’s peacekeeping force, which plays a vital role in resolving conflicts and preventing the escalation of violence worldwide. India, as a staunch advocate for peace and an active participant in peacekeeping missions, has made substantial contributions to this endeavour. The Role of UN’s Peacekeeping Force The United Nations’ peacekeeping force is an integral component of its efforts to maintain international peace and security. These missions are typically deployed in conflict zones or areas where tensions threaten to boil over into violence. The primary objectives of UN peacekeeping missions include: 1. Conflict Prevention and Resolution: UN peacekeepers aim to prevent the outbreak of violence by acting as a buffer between conflicting parties and facilitating dialogue and negotiations. In cases of ongoing conflicts, they work towards finding peaceful resolutions and ceasefires. 2. Protection of Civilians: Ensuring the safety and well-being of civilians caught in the crossfire is a paramount responsibility of UN peacekeepers. They provide humanitarian assistance, create safe zones, and protect vulnerable populations. 3. Disarmament and Demobilization: In post-conflict scenarios, peacekeepers assist in disarmament and demobilization efforts, helping combatants transition into civilian life and reintegrate into society. 4. Monitoring and Reporting: Peacekeeping missions closely monitor adherence to ceasefire agreements and report violations, contributing to the international community’s understanding of the situation on the ground. 5. Electoral Assistance: UN peacekeepers often support the organization of free and fair elections in post-conflict countries to ensure the establishment of stable and legitimate governments. 6. Capacity Building: They also work on strengthening the capacity of local institutions and law enforcement agencies to maintain peace and security in the long term. India’s Contribution to UN Peacekeeping Force and Missions India’s role in United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions stands as a testament to its unwavering dedication to global peace and stability. Some notable aspects of India’s involvement in UN peacekeeping include: 1. Historic Participation and Large Contingents India has held the distinction of being the largest troop contributor to UN missions since their inception. With a record of participating in 49 peacekeeping missions, India’s total contribution exceeds a staggering 1,95,000 troops, in addition to a substantial number of deployed police personnel. This remarkable commitment solidifies India’s position as a global leader in supporting UN peacekeeping efforts. 2. Leadership Roles and Diplomatic Engagement India’s involvement extends beyond troop deployments. It boasts a rich history of providing 15 Force Commanders in various UN Missions, showcasing its military expertise and leadership. Presently, Maj Gen Jai Shanker Menon, VSM serves as the Force Commander in UNDOF (Golan Heights). India also had the honour of contributing two Military Advisors and One Deputy Military Advisor to the Secretary General of the United Nations, along with two Divisional Commanders and seven Deputy Force Commanders. Moreover, the Indian Army has contributed lady officers as Military Observers and Staff Officers, demonstrating a commitment to gender equality in peacekeeping. India’s diplomatic endeavours complement these efforts, working toward building international consensus on peace and security issues, promoting dialogue among conflicting parties, and actively engaging in diplomatic peace processes. 3. Humanitarian Assistance and Gender Equality India’s contributions encompass not only military personnel but also vital humanitarian assistance. Indian peacekeeping missions often feature medical and engineering units that provide invaluable support in conflict zones. These units have played a pivotal role in constructing essential infrastructure and delivering crucial medical aid to regions affected by conflict, exemplifying India’s multifaceted approach to peacekeeping. India’s commitment to gender equality is evident in its deployments of female peacekeepers, promoting active participation in peace and security efforts. Notably, India deployed the first all-women contingent in a peacekeeping mission, a Formed Police Unit, to the UN Operation in Liberia (UNMIL) in 2007. 4. The Ultimate Sacrifice While India’s commitment to UN peacekeeping is commendable, it has come at a significant cost. In the pursuit of global peace, 168 Indian soldiers have made the supreme sacrifice, laying down their lives while serving under the blue flag. These brave individuals exemplify the selfless commitment of Indian peacekeepers to the cause of global peace and stability, and their sacrifices must not be forgotten. The International Day of Peace serves as a stark reminder of the crucial role played by the UN’s peacekeeping force in maintaining global peace and security. These missions have made significant strides in preventing conflicts, protecting civilians, and aiding in post-conflict reconstruction. India’s unwavering commitment to peacekeeping efforts is evident in its substantial contributions, both in terms of personnel and resources. As we commemorate this day, let us acknowledge the essential work of UN peacekeepers worldwide and appreciate the efforts of countries like India in fostering a more peaceful world. Ultimately, it is through collective international action that we can aspire to achieve lasting peace and prosperity for all."

    "article_content": "Amidst the challenging macroeconomic environment in many countries and concerns around public debt sustainability, progress in financing climate action in Asia and the Pacific has only fallen further behind, even as global emissions and energy needs continue to rise. A new report by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) highlights the urgent issue of sustainable finance in the region as well as discusses the challenges and opportunities for policymakers, regulators and private finance in bridging this gap. “Inaction is no longer an option. All stakeholders must commit to accelerate change by transforming their financing priorities, processes and programs, in order to meet the Sustainable Development Goals and climate action ambitions,” said Hamza Ali Malik, Director of the Macroeconomic Policy and Financing for Development Division, ESCAP. Only 17 of the 51 Asia-Pacific countries party to the UNFCCC have assessed and reported their financial needs to meet their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and only seven have broken down financial needs between adaptation and mitigation. Moreover, average economic losses resulting from disaster-related and other natural hazards in the region are forecast to increase to $1.1 trillion in a moderate climate-change scenario and $1.4 trillion in a worst-case scenario. The Sustainable Finance: Bridging the Gap in Asia and the Pacific report puts forward ten principles for action for policymakers, regulators and private finance. This includes activities for all stakeholders to cooperatively and efficiently shift and scale up capital to finance climate action, focusing on reducing obstacles, addressing the underpricing of climate-related risks, and reducing sectoral and regional mismatches between capital and investment needs. These insights further incorporate unique national contexts, as well as those for least developed countries and small island developing States. “At a time where multiple challenges are pushing against the critical but already lagging sustainability agenda, we need to cast off any paralysis we have and galvanise action. Finance is a key enabler for action and this report provides practical and effective ideas that we can immediately act on. I urge all stakeholders to urgently identify the areas where they can play a role and come together to deliver solutions,” said Eugene Wong, CEO, Sustainable Finance Institute Asia. The report also recognizes that there is sufficient capital and liquidity to close the global financing gap in sustainable finance. However, various challenges remain, as discussed in the report, to effectively deploy capital for climate action. “The Asia-Pacific region presents a huge opportunity for private capital to be mobilised at scale to fund the climate transition, especially in the hard-to-abate sectors. While voluntary market standards continue to harmonise transparency expectations and ensure investor confidence, both the public and private sectors should work together to enable policy and regulatory frameworks, and correspondingly leverage important financing options such as local currency and blended finance facilities,” said Ricco Zhang, Senior Director for Asia Pacific, International Capital Market Association. “I believe every stakeholder group will discover valuable insights and actionable ideas within this report on how to channel capital towards climate-related investments and socially just transition, ultimately bolstering the sustainable finance market and ensuring funding for the Sustainable Development Goals,” shared Aigul Kussaliyeva, Director of Sustainable Development, Astana International Financial Centre. The publication is part of the biennial Financing for Development Report Series produced by ESCAP and was officially launched at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand on 2 October. Speaking at the launch, Cherdchai Chaivaivid, Director-General of the Department of International Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand, commended the leadership of ESCAP in promoting sustainable finance and stressed the importance of the Report, which “ offered not only a comprehensive and in-depth analysis on sustainable financing, but also a practical way forward for tangible actions that countries could collectively and individually undertake.” He further reaffirmed Thailand’s readiness to support international collaboration on sustainable finance and to contribute to policy conversations on this issue going forward.

    "article_content": "Delegates from across Asia and the Pacific underscored the significance of population and development in a region home to more than 60 per cent of the world’s inhabitants, noting that decisions made by countries in this region shape the future of its 4.7 billion individuals as well as future generations across the globe. This important message was reiterated during the Seventh Asian and Pacific Population Conference, which reviewed the implementation of the Asian and Pacific Ministerial Declaration on Population and Development (2013) and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (1994). The three-day conference was jointly organized by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and brought together more than 400 government officials and representatives of civil society and youth groups. “Beyond sheer numbers, this gathering reflects our shared commitment to addressing the population dynamics in our region. The collective resolve, constructive dialogues, and solution-oriented approach evident throughout the conference underscore our potential to make substantial contributions to ICPD30 and position ourselves for the post-2030 population and development agenda,” said Lin Yang, ESCAP Deputy Executive Secretary, during the closing of the conference today. The regional conference provided an opportunity to celebrate successes. Since the previous conference, convened ten years ago, Asia and the Pacific has seen increased life expectancy, along with a decline in maternal mortality, enhanced access to contraceptives and more girls going to school. These changes have occurred due to increased socioeconomic development, advancements in gender equality and people gaining greater agency to make decisions, including about their sexual and reproductive health. Delegates acknowledged that the following megatrends are affecting economic, social and environmental outcomes: shifting population dynamics, the intensifying climate crisis, increasing migration, growing urbanization and rapid digital advancement. Moreover, they noted that inequality and social injustice persist. The message was clear: Forward-looking policies that capitalize on the demographic transition and place individual rights and choices at the centre are key to building sustainable and thriving societies and economies. Additionally, partnerships across the region to exchange experiences, increase investments and accelerate progress and disaggregated data were noted as critical to achieving shared goals. “Strengthened regional collaboration is required now more than ever. And that is exactly what we have seen over the last week. The energy, spirit and genuine interest that each of you have shown to work together to advance the quality of life of every individual that calls this region home is promising,” said UNFPA Deputy Executive Director (Programme) Diene Keita, bringing the conference to a close. Facts and figures – Maternal mortality has declined by over 60 per cent in Asia and the Pacific since 2000. – While fewer women are dying giving birth, over 60,000 women still died in 2020. – In some countries, fewer than 25 per cent of women have access to and use modern contraception. – Since 1950, life expectancy at birth has increased by almost 30 years, from 43 years then to 75 years now. – The proportion of people aged 65 years or over is projected to almost double by 2050.

    "article_content": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has introduced a 5-year multi-entry tourist visa, garnering significant interest among the Indian population. With over 3.8 million Indians residing in the UAE, they constitute about 38% of the country’s total population, making them the largest expatriate community there. This visa, designed to facilitate frequent travel, has seen a surge in demand, particularly highlighted during the recent Mumbai Travel Expo by the Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism. The 5-year multi-entry tourist visa, which has been available for the past two years, allows tourists to stay in the UAE for up to 90 days per visit. This duration can be extended by another 90 days, not exceeding a total of 180 days in a single year. Over the span of five years, this adds up to a potential 900 days in the UAE, though not consecutively. This visa is particularly beneficial for Indian entrepreneurs, business travelers, and families of Indian expatriates who frequently visit their relatives working in the UAE. To apply for the visa, applicants must meet certain financial criteria. The cost of the visa starts at AED 750, approximately INR 17,000. Additionally, applicants must submit a bank statement for the last six months, showing a balance of at least USD 4000, roughly INR 3,40,000. A refundable security deposit of AED 3025, around INR 69,000, is also required. These requirements ensure that applicants have sufficient financial stability to support themselves during their stay. The recent spotlight on the visa during the Mumbai Travel Expo has contributed to its growing popularity. However, the underlying reasons for the surge in interest are multifaceted. The significant Indian expatriate population in the UAE drives a continuous need for flexible travel options. Many Indian families prefer the multi-entry visa as it allows them to visit frequently without the hassle of reapplying for a visa each time. Moreover, Indian entrepreneurs find the visa advantageous for conducting business, attending meetings, and exploring new opportunities in the UAE’s thriving economy. The 5-year multi-entry tourist visa offers several advantages for Indian travelers. It simplifies the travel process, reducing the need for multiple visa applications and providing flexibility for extended stays. This visa also supports the growing trend of Indians exploring international travel and business opportunities. As the UAE continues to position itself as a global hub for tourism and commerce, the multi-entry visa caters to the dynamic needs of the Indian community, fostering stronger ties between the two regions. The introduction of the 5-year multi-entry tourist visa aligns with the UAE’s broader economic strategies to attract more tourists and business travelers. By facilitating easier access for Indians, the UAE stands to benefit from increased tourism revenue and strengthened economic partnerships. Additionally, the visa supports social connectivity, allowing Indian families to maintain close ties despite geographical distances. The UAE’s 5-year multi-entry tourist visa represents a significant development in fostering greater mobility and connectivity for Indian travelers. With its flexible terms and financial prerequisites, the visa caters to the diverse needs of Indian entrepreneurs, families, and tourists. As highlighted during the Mumbai Travel Expo, this visa is set to play a crucial role in enhancing bilateral relations and economic engagement between India and the UAE."

    "article_content": "आज दुनिया वर्ल्ड एनवायरनमेंट डे मना रही है। बढ़ती गर्मी, बाढ़ और तमाम प्राकृतिक आपदाओं के बीच पर्यावरण संरक्षण की महत्वता को किसी को समझाने की जरुरत नहीं है। पर्यावरण में होते बदलाव के साक्षी तो हर कोई हो रहा है, इस बदलाव के पीड़ित लोग पर्यावरण को कोसते तो नज़र आते हैं लेकिन एक कदम बढ़कर पर्यावरण संरक्षण के लिए एक पेड़ तक नहीं लगाते। आज की दुनिया में जनसंख्या के बढ़ते दबाव और प्राकृतिक संसाधनों की घटती उपलब्धता के कारण पर्यावरण को काफी नुकसान हो रहा है। मानव हस्तक्षेप ने ग्लोबल वार्मिंग, सूखा, बाढ़, मरुस्थलीकरण और भूमि और मिट्टी के कटाव सहित कई चुनौतियों को जन्म दिया है। इन जरूरी मुद्दों को पहचानते हुए, कई राष्ट्रीय और अंतर्राष्ट्रीय Development Organizations पर्यावरण संरक्षण (Environmental Conservation) की दिशा में कदम उठा रहे हैं। इनमें से एक है एसबीआई फाउंडेशन (SBI Foundation) और संकल्प रूरल डेवलपमेंट सोसाइटी (Sankalpa Rural Development Society (SRDS) अपने सीएसआर पहल से एसबीआई फाउंडेशन और संकल्प रूरल डेवलपमेंट सोसाइटी करता है पर्यावरण संरक्षण एसबीआई फाउंडेशन ( SBI Foundation ) और संकल्प रूरल डेवलपमेंट सोसाइटी (Sankalpa Rural Development Society (SRDS) ने मिलकर कर्नाटक के गडग जिले में सामुदायिक तालाबों का कायाकल्प कर रही है जिसका सीधा फायदा गांव वालों, छोटे और सीमांत किसानों को हो रहा है। दरअसल इस साल विश्व पर्यावरण दिवस का थीम, “Land Restoration, Desertification, and Drought Resilience जैसे जलवायु चुनौतियों के खिलाफ land degradation and resilience को संबोधित करने की तत्काल जरूरत को रेखांकित करती है। जो एसबीआई फाउंडेशन और संकल्प रूरल डेवलपमेंट सोसाइटी मिलकर कर्नाटक में कर रही है। एसबीआई ये पर्यावरण संरक्षण का काम अपने सीएसआर फंड (Corporate Social Responsibility) से कर रही है। देश के कई इलाकों जहां किसान सूखे की मार झेल रहे है वहीं इस तरह के सीएसआर पहल (CSR) से न सिर्फ Environmental Conservation को बल मिलता है बल्कि स्थानीय निवासियों और किसानों को भी पर्याप्त मात्रा में पानी की उपलब्धता होती है। सूखाग्रस्त जिला है कर्नाटक का गडग, सीएसआर से हो रहा है पर्यावरण संरक्षण गडग जिला कर्नाटक के सूखाग्रस्त क्षेत्रों में से एक है। पिछले दो सालों में एसबीआई फाउंडेशन की “रायता बंधु” पहल सूखे की इस चुनौती को प्रभावी ढंग से संबोधित कर रही है। इस पहल से गडग जिले के गांव वालों, छोटे और सीमांत किसानों को बहुत फायदा हो रहा है। रायता बंधु पहल से सामुदायिक तालाबों, खेत से जुड़ी तालाबों और फार्म मेड़ों का कायाकल्प और निर्माण किया जा रहा है। जहां तालाब नहीं है वहां नए तालाब बनाये जा रहे है और जहां है वहां के तालाबों का गहरीकरण किया जा रहा है। इस पहल से भूजल स्तर का भी रिचार्ज हो रहा है साथ ही मिट्टी के कटाव और भूमि क्षरण को रोकना और किसानों को रबी मौसम के दौरान तालाब के पानी का उपयोग करने में सक्षम बना रहा है। अब तक, इस पहल ने गडग जिले के मुंदरगी ब्लॉक के 20 गांवों में 100 खेत बांध, 40 खेत तालाब बनाए हैं और 20 सामुदायिक तालाबों का कायाकल्प किया है। Afforestation से हो रहा है मौसम में बदलाव संरक्षण की दिशा में एक अन्य प्रयास में कर्नाटक राज्य ग्रामीण विकास विश्वविद्यालय (Karnataka State Rural Development University (KSRDPRU) के सहयोग से कर्नाटक के गडग जिले में ही एसबीआई फाउंडेशन ने Afforestation पहल शुरू की गई है। इस पहल का उद्देश्य बंजर जमीन को जंगल में परिवर्तित करना है। इसके लिए 10 एकड़ की जमीन भी दी गयी है और एक समर्पित वन सेवक ने पिछले दो वर्षों में पेड़ों के लिए नियमित रूप से पानी देने और जन-वन के दैनिक रखरखाव को सुनिश्चित किया है। जन-वन में कुल 15,000 पौधे लगाए गए हैं, जिनमें से 90% पौधे जीवित हैं और उल्लेखनीय वृद्धि दिखा रहे हैं। इस साल हम देश में अब तक के सबसे अधिक तापमान का अनुभव कर रहे हैं। जन-वन पहल निश्चित तौर पर टेम्प्रेचर को कम करने और नियंत्रित करने में मदद करेगी, साथ ही इलाके में Desertification and Land Degradation को भी रोकेगी।"

    "article_content": "उत्तर प्रदेश में सोलर एनर्जी को प्रोत्साहित कर रही योगी सरकार की पहल से सिर्फ सिटी ही नहीं, बल्कि गांवों तक सोलर एनर्जी को पहुंचाने का प्रयास किया जा रहा है। इसी क्रम में ललितपुर में जिला प्रशासन ने सीएम योगी (UP CM Yogi News) की मंशा के अनुरूप कई गांवों को सोलर एनर्जी (Solar Energy in UP) से रोशन कर मिसाल पेश की है। यहां पर पहले चरण में पांच गांवों को सोलर एनर्जी से रोशन किया गया है। जबकि पूरे शहर को सौर ऊर्जा से रोशन करने के लिए रोडमैप तैयार किया जा रहा है। Uttar Pradesh के बुंदेलखंड रीजन को सौर ऊर्जा का हब बनाने के लिए उत्तर प्रदेश सरकार सोलर पार्क विकसित कर रही है। झांसी, ललितपुर और चित्रकूट में सबसे बड़े सोलर पार्क को 9 हजार एकड़ में विकसित किया जा रहा है, जहां पर 2 हजार मेगावाट का सोलर प्लांट (Solar Plant) स्थापित किया जाएगा। इससे हर साल 4700 मिलियन यूनिट बिजली का उत्पादन होगा। इसके लिए लक्षित भूमि को लीज पर लेने की प्रक्रिया जारी है। सोलर सिटी के विजन में ललितपुर ने पेश की मिसाल पिछली सरकारों में उपेक्षा का दंश और संसाधनों के लूट का शिकार रहा बुंदेलखंड आज मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ के नेतृत्व में विकास के नये आयाम स्थापित कर रहा है। वर्तमान में बुंदेलखंड को जहां एक ओर बल्क ड्रग पार्क का हब बनाया जा रहा है, तो वहीं इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर को गति देने के लिए ‘बीडा’ का गठन कर अनेक कदम उठाए जा रहे हैं। इसी कड़ी में ललितपुर ने सोलर एनर्जी के क्षेत्र में बड़ी उपलब्धि हासिल की है। यहां पर सीएम योगी के विजन के तहत पहले चरण में जंगल से सटे पांच गांव के करीब साढ़े तीन सौ घर सोलर पावर से जगमगा रहे हैं। इसके साथ ही 73 स्ट्रीट लाइट ने सड़कों के अंधेरे को खत्म कर दिया है। यूपी में सीएसआर फंड के जरिए सोलर प्लांट से घरों और सड़कों को किया रोशन The CSR Journal से ख़ास बातचीत करते हुए ललितपुर के डीएम अक्षय त्रिपाठी ने बताया कि विकासखंड मड़ावरा के वनगुवां, लखंजर, हीरापुर, पापड़ा और बारई गांव जंगलों के बीच में बसे हुए हैं। ऐसे में यहां पर बिजली की आपूर्ति के लिए लाइन को जंगलों से होकर ले जाना पड़ेगा। इससे जंगल को नुकसान के साथ वन्यजीवों पर भी इसका विपरीत प्रभाव पड़ेगा। इस पर हमने यहां पर सोलर पावर से बिजली सप्लाई की योजना बनायी। इन गांवों में सर्वे कराया गया तो पाया गया कि यहां पर सोलर प्लांट के जरिये बिजली की आपूर्ति की जाती थी, लेकिन पिछले कुछ वर्षों से वह निष्क्रिय हो गये हैं। ऐसे में दोबारा सोलर पावर शुरू करने के लिए 3 गांव के लिए सीएसआर फंड और दो गांव के लिए जिला खनिज निधि के जरिये करीब 70 लाख की धनराशि जुटाई गयी। इसके बाद यहां पर सोलर पावर को दुरुस्त किया गया और गांव में बिजली सप्लाई शुरू की गयी। उन्होंने बताया कि आज इन गांवों के हर घर को दो बल्ब व पंखे का कनेक्शन दिया गया है। गांव वालों को सोलर पावर के जरिये निशुल्क बिजली की सप्लाई की जा रही है। हर साल 1400 मिलियन यूनिट बिजली का होगा उत्पादन, यूपी में सीएसआर से होगा विकास जिलाधिकारी अक्षय त्रिपाठी ने बताया कि सीएम योगी के विजन के तहत पहले चरण में पांच गांव को सोलर के जरिये बिजली की आपूर्ति की जा रही है। अब दूसरे चरण में शहर के सभी सरकारी भवनों में सौर ऊर्जा के जरिये बिजली की आपूर्ति की जाएगी। इसके साथ ही सोलर पार्क के लिए 2700 एकड़ भूमि के सापेक्ष अब तक 1317.80 एकड़ सरकारी और 1022.73 एकड़ निजी भूमि को चिन्हित किया जा चुका है। इसमें लगभग 86 प्रतिशत भूमि लीज पर अधिग्रहित की जा चुकी है। उन्होंने बताया कि करीब 9 गांव की जमीन को चिन्हित किया गया है। यहां पर फेन्सिंग कार्य एवं सौर ऊर्जा निकासी के लिए आंतरिक ग्रिड सब स्टेशन के निर्माण का काम यूपीपीसीएल की ओर से किया जा रहा है। 600 मेगावॉट क्षमता के इस प्लांट से प्रतिवर्ष 1400 मिलियन यूनिट बिजली का उत्पादन किया जाएगा। इसके पहले भी यूपी के विकास में सीएसआर की भूमिका अहम रही है।"

    "article_content": "Bounteous x Accolite, a global leader in IT services, has undertaken a significant initiative to revitalize the Government Higher Secondary School (GHSS) in Kannagi Nagar, Chennai. The company has partnered with the NGO Ladies Circle India Trust to upgrade the school’s infrastructure. Dr. V. Irai Anbu, former Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary inaugurated the revamped school that caters to 1500 students from grades 6 to 12. He motivated the students and emphasized the importance of education. Kannagi Nagar, one of India’s largest resettlement sites, houses over 80,000 people, many displaced from their original homes by the tragic 2004 tsunami. According to a study, only 10% of children in Kannagi Nagar had access to educational facilities. With only 2,000 school seats available for 20,000 school-going children, the area faces a 35% dropout rate among 15–18-year-olds, and 42% of students commute over 20 km to other schools. Established in 2004, GHSS has been struggling with inadequate infrastructure for years. Before this intervention, GHSS Kannagi Nagar faced numerous challenges, including overcrowded classrooms, insufficient furniture, poor electrical fixtures and safety issues due to a lack of proper infrastructure. Recognizing these pressing needs, Bounteous x Accolite collaborated with Ladies Circle India Trust to execute a comprehensive renovation project aimed at transforming the school environment. Key improvements included repairing roofs and floors to enhance safety, installing new benches, desks, and green boards to create more conducive learning environments, electrical upgrades and erecting a secure compound wall with a gate to bolster safety measures. Additionally, Bounteous x Accolite facilitated the setup of a modern computer lab equipped with12 laptops and 26 desktops to boost digital literacy among students and prepare them for future academic and career pursuits. The upgrades have had a profound impact, as evidenced by the positive feedback from students and educators. J. Jayshri, a class IX student, expressed her enthusiasm, stating, “When I joined the school, the infrastructure was in a very bad state. When it rained, the water seeped through the roof, and when it was hot, it was unbearable to sit inside with no fans. Now, the new benches, freshly painted classrooms, and pleasant atmosphere make me excited to come to school every day”. Mrs. Andeshwari, the school’s Head Mistress, highlighted the transformative impact of the initiative, stating, “The renovation has brought a renewed sense of pride and motivation among both students and teachers. The improvements have made the school safer, more functional, and instilled a sense of discipline and belonging in our students.” “This initiative at GHSS Kannagi Nagar underscores the potential for corporate partnerships to drive meaningful change in educational institutions, setting a positive example for community involvement and social responsibility,” said Leela Kaza, Founder and Co-CEO of Bounteous x Accolite. We aim to create an environment that encourages students to enroll in the school and reach their full potential by cultivating essential skills required to become first-time graduates. We are proud to partner with Ladies Circle India Trust in this endeavour and look forward to seeing the students thrive”. Looking ahead, Bounteous x Accolite plans to continue supporting GHSS Kannagi Nagar with initiatives focused on holistic student development, including skill-building programs to prepare students for future academic and career opportunities.

    "article_content": "The workshop calls for Non-Profit organisations, CSR Professionals, researchers and students to get trained by academicians, practitioners and thought leaders of various Departments and Faculties from TISS and its affiliate institutions. A developing country such as India has a lot of social issues that need to be addressed. Several organisations are constantly working towards it with the support of individuals, government as well as the corporates. This has subjected the non-profit sector to be more accountable and transparent about their actions, which would help in bringing solutions to the social problems of the country and build a renewed social contract between all the entities based on ethics and mutual respect. Taking a step towards educating more individuals to participate in social and national development at a professional level, The Tata Institute of Social Sciences is announcing a Programme and Financial Management Workshop for Non-Profit organisations, CSR professionals, researchers and students. In an environment that is so competitive and complex, the non-profit sector must adapt to this need for accountability while retaining the essence of its programs and accountability to their core vision as well as stakeholders. While NPOs are acknowledging these due processes, it is a challenge for some to deliver on these premises. It is critical that non-profits focus on good governance, financial due diligence, robust monitoring, evaluation, learning and documentation. Entailing a comprehensive schedule that includes takeaways for all partners, the TISS AESDII training program under its vertical TISS AESDII Knowledge Sharing Network adopts a hands-on approach and endeavours to create a convergence based on solutions, build internal capacities of both funders and non-profits to forge new partnerships for development. The program will bring together academicians, practitioners and thought leaders of various Departments and Faculties from across campuses of the globally acclaimed Tata Institute of Social Sciences and its affiliate institutions as master trainers. Designed to be a joint effort to deliberate and act toward ‘people-centered sustainable development’ policies, this program intends to be a platform for development practitioners for sharing perspectives, enhancing and acquiring skills, validating theories and applying models of practice.

    "article_content": "The five-day certificate program by TISS is an attempt at training more individuals to participate in social and national development at a professional level. CSR is now considered more than just an act of philanthropy. The CSR mandate has led to increased partnerships between the myriad development stakeholders including corporations and Not for Profit Organizations(NPOs). With the grassroots implementation expertise of NPOs and the results-oriented management style of a corporate, CSR programmes are better equipped to approach social issues in a practical and holistic way. Given the complex problems the world faces today, CSR is also a part of the business strategy for many corporates. Where initially CSR was managed by the HR department, companies are now dedicating a separate department for its implementation. There is now an increased demand for CSR professionals. Amidst this scenario, the Tata Institute of Social Sciences is announcing the second batch of its 5-day Certificate Training Program, ‘Development Perspectives, Managements and Practices’. The certificate program is an attempt at training more individuals to participate in social and national development professionally. Entailing a comprehensive schedule that includes takeaways for all change agents, the TISS AESDII training program under the Knowledge Sharing Network adopts a hands-on approach and endeavours to create convergence-based solutions, while building internal capacities of both funders and non-profits for being able to forge new partnerships that optimise the achievement of social impact.

The organization has already clocked more than a million students covering 14 states and about 3500 schools in counselling and many more in skill development and training. Santosh Huralikoppi, Chief Mentor and Ketan Deshpande, Founder – FUEL interacted at length with the President of India – Ram Nath Kovind. They explained to the president, the work that is being carried across India by the organisation, in the field of education and training of the underprivileged, especially to the deserving children of Army Jawans and the Police Personnel, who unlike civilians, get pretty less time to give to their children and accordingly take right career decisions for them. The President – Ram Nath Kovind, lauded the efforts and encouraged the duo to continue working in the same manner. The president suggested to keep pushing the boundaries, to reach the maximum deserving children for the better future of India. Previously, the organisation has been awarded the Champions of Change award organized by Niti Aayog by the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The organisation has also had the privilege to meet the former President of India – Late Abdul Kalam, twice, due to the exemplary work. Fuel is associated with the Niti Aayog, to train the children in Aspirational Districts Programme of the central government. They also have associations with other state governments as well as renowned universities across India to operate their programs efficiently. Fuel has also taken the onus of improving the employability in India. It is working towards the training of Future Skills – which deals with the subject of advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Blockchain Technology and more, which are shaping the current scenario of the industry. The organisation is making efforts to make the youth of India ready for Industry 4.0 and its challenges. “We are soon coming up with a Future Skills University – One of its kind in India, which shall help the students upgrade their knowledge and get equipped for the ever-changing industry”, said Chairman Fuel – Ketan Deshpande. “The interaction with President has only inspired us to work harder towards our goal of 10 million students,” said Santosh Huralikoppi, Chief Mentor – Fuel. The Fuel team has invited the Defence Minister of India, Rajnath Singh to the Fuel Convocation where army children will be receiving the scholarships and awards. The team has handed over the donation cheque of Rs. 20 Lakh to the minister towards the education of children of Army Jawans.

    "article_content": "Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a global health concern that affects millions of individuals. Despite its prevalence, many people remain unaware of its risks, causes, and management strategies. World Hypertension Day, observed on May 17th each year, aims to raise awareness about this silent yet dangerous condition. This day serves as a crucial reminder to educate ourselves and our communities about hypertension, encouraging proactive measures for prevention and control. In light of World Hypertension Day, we have compiled a comprehensive list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) to address common myths and provide accurate information about hypertension. Understanding these FAQs can empower you to take charge of your health, make informed decisions, and reduce the risk of complications associated with high blood pressure. Whether you are newly diagnosed, managing the condition for years, or seeking to prevent it, this article offers valuable insights into hypertension, debunking myths and presenting the facts you need to know. FAQs on Hypertension What is hypertension? Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a condition where the force of the blood against the artery walls is consistently too high. It is often defined as having a blood pressure reading of 140/90 mmHg or higher. Over time, high blood pressure can lead to serious health problems like heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. What are the common symptoms of hypertension? Hypertension is often called the “silent killer” because it typically has no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they might include headaches, shortness of breath, nosebleeds, flushing, dizziness, chest pain, and visual changes. These symptoms usually appear when blood pressure is extremely high. How is blood pressure measured? Blood pressure is measured using a sphygmomanometer, which consists of an inflatable cuff placed around the arm and a pressure-measuring gauge. Blood pressure readings have two numbers: systolic pressure (upper number) and diastolic pressure (lower number). The systolic pressure measures the force in the arteries when the heart beats, while the diastolic pressure measures the force in the arteries between beats. What are the different stages of hypertension? Hypertension is categorized into stages: – Normal: Less than 120/80 mmHg – Elevated: 120-129/<80 mmHg – Hypertension Stage 1: 130-139/80-89 mmHg – Hypertension Stage 2: 140/90 mmHg or higher – Hypertensive Crisis: Higher than 180/120 mmHg, requiring immediate medical attention. What causes hypertension? Hypertension can be primary (essential) or secondary. Primary hypertension has no identifiable cause and develops gradually over many years. Secondary hypertension is caused by an underlying condition such as kidney disease, hormonal disorders, certain medications, or sleep apnea. Who is at risk for hypertension? Risk factors for hypertension include age (more common in older adults), family history, being overweight or obese, lack of physical activity, smoking, high sodium diet, low potassium diet, excessive alcohol consumption, stress, and chronic conditions such as diabetes and kidney disease. How can hypertension be prevented? Preventative measures include maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet low in salt, exercising regularly, avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol intake, managing stress, and regularly monitoring blood pressure. How is hypertension diagnosed? Hypertension is diagnosed through multiple blood pressure readings taken on different occasions. A doctor may also perform additional tests such as blood tests, urine tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG), or an echocardiogram to determine if hypertension has caused any damage to the heart or other organs. What are the complications of untreated hypertension? Untreated hypertension can lead to serious health issues, including heart attack, stroke, heart failure, aneurysm, kidney damage, vision loss, metabolic syndrome, and cognitive decline. What lifestyle changes can help manage hypertension? Effective lifestyle changes include adopting a heart-healthy diet (such as the DASH diet), reducing salt intake, engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol consumption, and managing stress. What medications are commonly prescribed for hypertension? Common medications include diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and renin inhibitors. The choice of medication depends on the individual’s specific health needs and any underlying conditions. Can hypertension be cured? While hypertension cannot usually be cured, it can be effectively managed with lifestyle changes and medication. Proper management can reduce the risk of complications and improve quality of life. How often should blood pressure be checked? Adults should have their blood pressure checked at least once every two years if their readings are normal. Those with high blood pressure or risk factors should have it checked more frequently, as recommended by their healthcare provider. What is white coat hypertension? White coat hypertension occurs when a patient’s blood pressure is higher at the doctor’s office than it is in other settings, possibly due to anxiety. Monitoring blood pressure at home or using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can help differentiate this condition from true hypertension. How does salt affect blood pressure? Excessive salt intake can increase blood pressure by causing the body to retain water, which increases the volume of blood in the arteries. Reducing salt intake can help lower blood pressure. What role does potassium play in managing blood pressure? Potassium helps balance the amount of sodium in cells, and insufficient potassium can lead to an increase in blood pressure. Eating foods rich in potassium, such as bananas, oranges, and leafy greens, can help manage blood pressure. How does stress affect blood pressure? Chronic stress can contribute to high blood pressure by encouraging unhealthy habits such as poor diet, physical inactivity, and alcohol or tobacco use. Stress management techniques, including relaxation exercises and mindfulness, can help lower blood pressure. Can exercise lower blood pressure? Yes, regular physical activity strengthens the heart, enabling it to pump blood with less effort. This reduces the pressure on the arteries, thereby lowering blood pressure. Both aerobic exercises and strength training can be beneficial. What is the DASH diet? The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. It limits sodium, red meat, sweets, and sugary beverages. This diet has been shown to lower blood pressure. How can someone monitor their blood pressure at home? Home blood pressure monitors are widely available and easy to use. It is important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully. Measurements should be taken at the same time each day, and it’s advisable to sit quietly for a few minutes before measuring. Keeping a log of readings can help track progress and provide useful information to healthcare providers. Do I need to get treatment if I have no symptoms? Hypertension is often called the “silent killer” because it typically has no symptoms until significant damage has occurred. Many people with hypertension feel perfectly fine and are unaware of their condition until they are screened during a routine check-up. Should young people be concerned about high blood pressure? Yes, hypertension can affect people of all ages. While it is more common in older adults, lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and obesity can lead to high blood pressure in younger individuals as well. Is high blood pressure only caused by high salt intake? No, while excessive salt intake can contribute to hypertension, it is not the only cause. Hypertension can also result from genetic factors, obesity, lack of physical activity, alcohol consumption, stress, and certain medical conditions. If I start taking medication for hypertension, will I always need to take it? Not necessarily. Some people can control their blood pressure through lifestyle changes and may be able to reduce or discontinue medication under a doctor’s supervision. However, hypertension often requires lifelong management, and stopping medication without medical advice can be dangerous. Does normal blood pressure on medication mean I no longer have hypertension? No, normal blood pressure readings while on medication indicate that the treatment is effective. However, this does not mean that hypertension is cured. Continuing the prescribed treatment and lifestyle modifications is crucial to maintain normal blood pressure. Is hypertension a serious condition? Hypertension is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and other serious health problems. It is crucial to manage and control high blood pressure to prevent these complications. Can drinking coffee cause long-term hypertension? While caffeine can cause a temporary spike in blood pressure, it does not cause long-term hypertension in most people. However, individuals who are sensitive to caffeine may experience more significant blood pressure increases and should monitor their intake. Is hypertension only a problem for overweight individuals? No, while being overweight increases the risk of hypertension, thin people can also develop high blood pressure. Factors such as genetics, diet, stress, and physical activity levels play significant roles in blood pressure regulation. Is low blood pressure always better than high blood pressure? No, extremely low blood pressure can be just as dangerous as high blood pressure, leading to dizziness, fainting, and even shock. Maintaining blood pressure within a normal range is essential for overall health. Understanding the facts about hypertension is crucial for effective prevention and management of this common but serious condition. Regular check-ups, a healthy lifestyle, and adherence to prescribed treatments can help manage blood pressure and reduce the risk of complications."

    "article_content": "गंगा को स्वच्छ और निर्मल बनाने के लिए नमामि गंगे मिशन (Namami Gange Mission) द्वारा किए जा रहे प्रयासों के फलस्वरूप गंगा नदी में डॉल्फिन का कुनबा बढ़ रहा है। भारतीय वन्यजीव संस्थान ( Wildlife Institute of India) के मुताबिक इस समय गंगा और उसकी सहायक नदियों में लगभग 4000 डॉल्फिन मौजूद हैं। जानकार इसे पर्यावरण के लिए अच्छा संकेत बता रहे हैं। इससे पता चलता है कि यूपी में गंगा में डॉल्फिन को अनुकूल वातावरण मिल रहा है और गंगा का पानी भी साफ है। आने वाले समय में डॉल्फिन की संख्या और बढ़ने का अनुमान लगाया जा रहा है। अकेले यूपी में गांगेय डॉल्फिन की संख्या 2000 तक पहुंची एक अनुमान के मुताबिक, उत्तर प्रदेश में गांगेय डॉल्फिन (Ganges River Dolphin) की संख्या 2000 तक होने की उम्मीद है। जो कि भारत में पाई जाने वाली कुल गांगेय डॉल्फिन की संख्या का आधे से अधिक है। ऐसे में इनके संरक्षण और संवर्धन की सर्वाधिक जिम्मेदारी भी उत्तर प्रदेश सरकार की ही बनती है। इसके मद्देनज़र उत्तर प्रदेश ने राज्य के लिए नई पर्यटन नीति लागू कर चंबल सेंचुरी (Chambal ) में डॉल्फिन सेंचुरी क्षेत्र की घोषणा की थी। आज चंबल क्षेत्र में लगभग 111 डॉल्फिन की मौजूदगी दर्ज की गई है। गंगा और उसकी सहायक नदियों में लगभग 4000 डॉल्फिन मौजूद गौरतलब है कि प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी (PM Narendra Modi on Environment and Ganga) द्वारा प्रोजेक्ट डॉल्फिन की घोषणा किए जाने के बाद आम लोगों में इस अनोखे और दुर्लभ जीव के प्रति उत्सुकता बढ़ी है। दूसरा पहलू यह भी है कि एक बड़ी आबादी अभी इस करिश्माई मेगा-फौना से अपरिचित है। इसलिए गांगेय डॉल्फिनों के संरक्षण से न केवल इस प्रजाति के संरक्षण को लेकर जागरूकता आएगी बल्कि गंगा की निर्मलता और अविरलता के प्रयासों को भी बल मिलेगा। आने वाले समय में गंगा में डॉल्फिन की संख्या और बढ़ने का लगाया जा रहा अनुमान नमामि गंगे (Clean Ganga Mission) की योजनाओं में जागरूकता और जनभागीदारी मुख्य बिंदु हैं। इस आधार पर वर्ष 2030 तक गांगेय डॉल्फिन (Gangetic Dolphins) की आबादी में स्थिरता लाने और अधिक खतरे वाली प्रजातियों की संख्या दोगुनी करने का लक्ष्य रखा गया है। इस कवायद में स्वच्छ गंगा मिशन ने राज्य सरकारों, विशेषज्ञों, गैर सरकारी संगठनों और स्थानीय लोगों से बेहतर तालमेल बनाने में सफलता पाई है। नमामि गंगे परियोजना के प्रदूषण कम करने के उपायों, आर्द्र भूमि के बचाव और प्रवाह बेहतर करने की पहलों से गांगेय डॉल्फिनों की आबादी को उपयुक्त पर्यावास मिला है। भारत में इसे संरक्षित किया जा रहा है। अपेक्षाकृत गंगा और उसकी रामगंगा, यमुना, गोमती, घाघरा, राप्ती, सोन, गंडक, चंबल और कोसी में इनकी बहुलता है।"

    "article_content": "Nagaland is a border state of India with a majority of its population consisting of tribals. The state is considered to be an eco-sensitive zone for its role in supporting unique biodiversity. Because of this, as well as some other political factors, the state of Nagaland has not benefitted from development making it highly deserving of CSR investments. However, according to the National Corporate Social Responsibility Data Portal, Nagaland is not a preferred ground for undertaking CSR activities by the corporates in India. In FY 2021-22, the state received a cumulative of Rs. 12.42 crore of CSR funds, which is way higher as compared to the previous financial year 2020-21, when the state had received only Rs 3.57 cr CSR funds. A total of 20 companies carried out their CSR projects in the state. The CSR initiatives were carried out in a total of four sectors – Health, Rural Development, Environment and Education. The largest CSR spender in the state was Techno Electric and Engineering Company Ltd which spent Rs. 4.21 crore, followed by National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (2.24 cr) and REC Limited (1.91 cr). With an aim to attract more CSR funds, the State of Nagaland hosted a three-day CSR conclave starting on Monday, 22 nd August 2022. The Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman participated in the conclave and inaugurated 52 projects to be sponsored by various companies in Nagaland as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility. Most of the projects are related to health, education and skill and entrepreneurship development. Lamenting that Nagaland has not been getting enough CSR investment, she said the North-eastern state should be the natural choice of companies and investors. Finance Minister at Nagaland CSR Conclave There are problems in people’s expectations about CSR, because of which states like Nagaland have to wait for CSR to come, the Union minister said. However, she expressed confidence that the coming of companies for the conclave will be the stepping stone and many more will come and start investing in the state. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), according to Sitharaman, has said that it will open a training facility for Naga youngsters to improve their talent. She also recommended that the state government utilise the Atal Innovation Mission Projects of NITI Aayog to establish scientific labs in schools and innovation hubs in the upper classes to advance the study of science and technology. The minister urged the government to emphasise organic goods. Sitharaman asked that the state government create a Task Group of Naga Youths to help establish the brand of Nagaland throughout the nation and that Nagas should have suitable branding for their products. In order to draw CSR investments, she also opened exposition booths set up by various districts, departments, civil society organisations, and NGOs. Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio thanked the Indian government for emphasising the development of the region’s north. Top CSR Projects in Nagaland CSR of SBI General Insurance SBI General Insurance in association with North Eastern Development Finance Corporation Ltd. (NEDFi) in August, 2023 collaborated with Chakhesang Women Welfare Society on a project aimed at creating local employment and enhancing the livelihoods of families specifically in the Pfutsero region in Phek district of Nagaland. Under this CSR project, SBI General and NEDFi aim to empower farmers and their families from Nagaland in North Eastern region in the next two years by generating direct local employment at both the factory and farm level. The project envisages the upgradation of food processing unit-based machinery, focusing on the raw material strength of Nagaland, especially in Phek district, which is best known for its favourable conditions for horticulture and availability of a wide variety of food and crops, including high-value crops such as kiwi, persimmon, wild apple, gooseberry etc. This project is expected not only to contribute to the State’s GDP but also generate the much-needed local employment opportunities in rural areas and business opportunities for local entrepreneurs. The upgrading of the unit will help capitalise on the state’s rich raw material strength and focus on producing juices, candies, pickles, jam and jellies etc. CSR of Numaligarh Refinery Limited A first of its kind Histopathology unit was inaugurated at Naga Hospital Authority, Kohima under the initiative of Investment and Development Authority Nagaland (IDAN) and the Department of Health and family Welfare (DoHFW), Nagaland in March this year. This is the first histopathology unit that has been installed under the CSR initiative of Numaligarh Refinery Limited. Crucial for a number of services that involve examining the tissues and ultimately detect diseases through sophisticated techniques and expert evaluation by pathology, the Histopathology Unit is equipped with automatic tissue processor, embedding station, cooling plate, manual microtome, tissue flotation bath, grossing instruments, cytocentrifuge among a host of other equipment. CSR of Power Grid Corporation of India The Power Grid Corporation of India Limited as part of its CSR, donated a rescue van to Child Helpline 1098 in Mokokchung in December, 2023. The donation was officially made to the Deputy Commissioner who serves as the Chairman of the District Child Advisory Board. In October last year, a memorandum of understanding was signed between PGCIL and the Deputy Commissioner of Mokokchung to initiate this Corporate Social Responsibility activity. SBI Gram Seva SBI Gram Seva, a flagship program of SBI Foundation was launched in August 2017.

Electrification of a Village by Global Himalayan Expedition The Shinnyu village under the Mon district administration which is considered to be in the remotest part of the district has been electrified with solar power as part of a CSR initiative of the Global Himalayan Expedition (GHE). According to DIPR report, a total of 60 households, Churches and community hall was electrified using solar power. The entire cost for the project stood at Rs. 23 Lacs. The Shinnyu village is also considered to be the last village along the Indian Border. Antaran by Tata Trusts Antaran is an initiative by Tata Trusts to bring seminal changes in craft development, beginning with the Handloom sector, designed to transform traditional crafts through a multidimensional approach for technical, design, enterprise and market development interventions to strengthen craft based livelihoods.

    "article_content": "Practo, India’s leading healthcare technology company, marks its 16th year by announcing the completion of 2000 free cataract surgeries since May 2023 through the Practo Foundation Trust. Started in response to the urgent needs of disadvantaged communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Foundation provided 15,000+ free medical kits and doctor consultations and issued 6000+ free prescriptions as part of 700+ health camps. Now, it is focused on addressing the prevalent issue of cataracts, introducing its #Mission10kCataracts. Research highlights that 82% of adult blindness is preventable and cataracts, a clouding of the lens in the eye, constitute a major portion of these avoidable cases, making up 63% of preventable blindness. The cumulative loss of Gross National Income in India due to this avoidable blindness is INR 11,778.6 billion (Int$ 535 billion). Over the last two decades, this has increased by almost three times. In India, eliminating cataract blindness requires a significant increase in surgical intervention and despite the safety and effectiveness of cataract surgery, only 54% of individuals with cataracts actually undergo the procedure. Practo Foundation’s work aligns with this critical need. Last year, during health screenings of 1300+ beneficiaries, cataracts emerged as a prominent concern, constituting over 18% of overall healthcare issues. Witnessing the significant number of individuals living with preventable blindness motivated the Foundation to address this issue head-on. Shailendra Singh, MD, Peak XV and Supporter of Practo Foundation said, “ Since its inception, Practo’s mission has been to help improve healthcare in India. It has been a great privilege for Peak XV to be a part of this journey for over a decade, right from the seed stage. I have also been thrilled to be able to support the Practo Foundation in my personal capacity as an anchor donor. The Foundation’s impact-driven vision and purpose to help improve access to healthcare for those who need it the most is truly inspiring. ” To date, the Foundation has helped provide free cataract surgeries to close to 2000 individuals, across Karnataka, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh, at an average cost of INR 2000 per surgery. Among the beneficiaries, 58% were farmers, followed by 20% daily wage earners and 19% were unemployed. Additionally, 65% of the beneficiaries were aged 61 – 80 and 59% were female. “We envision a future where Indians are empowered to lead fulfilling lives, free from preventable illnesses, while maintaining their productivity. Despite facing increased vulnerability with age, middle-aged and older Indians remain the backbone of our communities, shouldering significant responsibilities. Through targeted support and healthcare solutions, we aim to protect their well-being and enhance their productivity. Our vision is to create a world where aging gracefully is achievable for everyone”, says Shashank ND, Trustee of Practo Foundation, and CEO & Co-founder of Practo. Surabhi Patodia, Founder Trustee of Practo Foundation and AVP – Communications & Content, said, “ Cataracts are just the start—a key step in our journey towards bigger changes. Each surgery builds trust and paves the way for our larger goal, which is to build self-sustaining communities. Together with our healthcare partners, we want to restore dignity and purpose in the lives of the economically disadvantaged by providing essential healthcare services in their vicinity .” To bridge the gaps for scalability, sustainability, and outcome of various government initiatives like Ayushman Bharat, the Foundation, together with its partners such LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPIE) and Pushpagiri Vitreo Retina Institute (PVRI) actively works towards awareness of government welfare schemes (national and state) at the ground level and drives them for increased utilization. With the evolving needs of the underserved community, Practo Foundation has operated across three phases since its inception, each serving a different need. As of now, the Foundation has partnered with close to 20 NGO & hospital partners to touch the lives of 50,000 individuals. Approach to Camps and Screening Practo Foundation’s approach to screening goes beyond mere accessibility, it organizes healthcare checkup camps, identifies and screens hospital partners, and ensures consistent quality throughout the process. By strategically organizing camps closer to beneficiary residences, and minimizing travel distance, Practo Foundation partners with local administrative officials to streamline the process and improve attendance rates. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are implemented at every stage, guaranteeing standardized and efficient processes. Surgical eligibility is carefully assessed, and consent forms are obtained from beneficiaries before each surgery. Post-operative care protocols are rigorously followed to minimise the risk of reinfection, with beneficiaries educated on proper care practices. Regular audits ensure operational integrity, ensuring surgeries are executed seamlessly without any gaps. Each camp operates with the utmost quality and integrity, delivering essential healthcare services to those in need. Disclaimer: This media release is auto-generated.

    "article_content": "Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar has once again expressed his desire to develop Government schools in the state with CSR support. While felicitating Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) examination toppers from government schools at his Bengaluru residence on Tuesday, Shivakumar announced his plan to upgrade government schools utilising CSR funds instead of relying on funds from the state. The deputy CM expressed that State government is trying to implement a new education system. He also spoke about his plans to provide international quality education to Govt School students in rural areas of Karnataka by developing infrastructure of these schools with CSR funds. The minister expressed his desire to host a meeting on the development of government schools after the Model Code of Conduct is withdrawn post the Lok Sabha Elections . The Model Code of Conduct lays down a list of do’s and don’ts for political parties and leaders ahead of elections and also restricts the government from announcing policy decisions. 20 Govt Schools in Ramanagara district being upgraded Meanwhile, DK Shivakumar informed that work is already in progress for upgrading 20 government schools in Ramanagara district. The minister had earlier announced that the government will provide land in the range of 2-4 acres for each school, and companies will construct the schools on the assigned land with their CSR funds. Each school will be equipped with classrooms, a library, a laboratory, toilets, staff rooms, etc. Top-quality schools for the government will be constructed with CSR funds. Each school is expected to cost between Rs 4-7 crore. CSR commitment of Rs 2000 cr In November last year, speaking at the inauguration of the three-day long Bangalore Tech Summit, the Deputy Chief Minister made an appeal to technology companies to invest their CSR funds for development of rural schools in Karnataka. “I have had discussions with several people including Rishad Premji of Wipro and they have committed to invest Rs 2000 crores to improve the quality of education in rural areas. While companies are strengthening the finances of the government, the companies also expect some incentives from the government. We have to work together,” Shivakumar had said at the event. Aim is to prevent migration “All Karnataka public schools will function as government schools, but the responsibility for education will be delegated to private educational institutions. We have already had a round of discussions with educational institutions. This initiative aims to prevent rural students from migrating to cities for better education. I have submitted a proposal to the Chief Minister to form a committee regarding this,” he had said. Bengaluru – India’s IT hub Further emphasizing the point that Bengaluru is India’s IT hub, the minister had said, “Bengaluru has earned its place in the world of technology. It is possible due to the ecosystem the city has to offer. Bengaluru and Karnataka have one of the highest numbers of engineering and medical colleges. Of the five million IT employees in India, two million are in Karnataka. No other State has so much human resource.”"

    "article_content": "Truck drivers from across India called off their nationwide protest against the new provisions for punishment for hit-and-run road accident cases. The decision comes after assurance from the government that it would consult All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) before implementing the new law. The truckers were protesting against a new law that prescribes punishment of up to 10 years’ imprisonment or a maximum penalty of Rs 7 lakh for those who run away without informing authorities after causing serious road accidents. As per the Annual Report on ‘Road Accidents in India-2022’ published by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, a total of 4,61,312 road accidents have been reported by Indian states and Union Territories during the calendar year 2022, which claimed 1,68,491 lives and caused injuries to 4,43,366 persons. This marks an increase of 11.9% in accidents, 9.4% in fatalities, and 15.3% in injuries compared to the previous year. The report underscores the urgency of adopting a comprehensive approach to address the contributing factors to these accidents, including speeding, reckless driving, drunken driving, and non-compliance with traffic regulations. It is crucial that we strengthen enforcement mechanisms, enhance driver education and training programs, and invest in improving the condition of roads and vehicles. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Government of India observes National Road Safety Month from 18 th January to 17 th February, every year with an aim to highlight road safety issues.

The purpose is to promote responsible road usage and cultivating safe riding habits. These Road Safety awareness programmes are interactive and engaging, catering to a wide range of age groups, from children to youth and are conducted in schools, colleges, government institutions, and non-governmental organisations. Through activities such as interactive games, role-playing, virtual experiences, and more, the goal is to raise awareness and encourage responsible road behaviour among all road users. This awareness initiative has already reached over 5.7 million Indians, as per an announcement made by Honda in September 2023. CSR of Gulf Oil Lubricants Gulf Oil Lubricants India Ltd. joined forces with the Lazy Rangers Motorcyclists Confederation in August 2023 to foster road safety awareness and advocate responsible riding habits. Gulf Oil chose the delivery partners’ community to distribute 100 helmets in the presence of the Navi Mumbai Traffic Police, underscoring the importance of governmental support in promoting road safety. By distributing helmets to the delivery partners who are always on the road for their livelihood, the initiative not only encourages the use of safety gear but also reinforces the shared responsibility of all road users in curbing preventable accidents.

During the month-long campaign trail, a team of trained emergency medical experts from Nanavati Hospital offered Basic Life Support (BLS) and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) training to employees of Mumbai Traffic Police, Mumbai Police and their families at Police Colony of Santacruz. Similar workshops along with educative skits by Mumbai Traffic Police were organized for citizens at four prominent city malls and Juhu Chowpatty. CSR of Exide Life Insurance Exide Life Insurance launched a film, #YouNeverRideAlone, as a part of their CSR campaign, Helmet Saves in March 2021. The film is aimed to act as a wake-up call for people to take Road safety seriously. The film opens to a man riding his motorbike enjoying the bright and sunny day. His helmet hangs by the handle unattended. The scene then cuts to the man’s parents, pregnant wife and young child standing symbolically on the same bike as he rides. There is a look of concern on their faces as the man approaches speed-breakers on the road, while the man seems oblivious of the danger. Thankfully, at the last moment, the man manages to stabilize his bike and makes it over the speed-breakers safely. This however jolts him into reality. He looks in his rearview mirror, and realizes that his family and their responsibility is always riding with him, no matter where he is. The film ends with the man making the smart choice of protecting himself with a helmet, for the sake of his family."

    "article_content": "In an exclusive interaction with The CSR Journal, Anisha Padukone, the CEO of the Live Love Laugh Foundation, sheds light on the critical importance of mental health advocacy in today’s society. With a personal and professional dedication to destigmatizing mental illness, Padukone discusses how Live Love Laugh has become a leading force in promoting understanding and support for those struggling with mental health challenges. Her insights underscore the pressing need for collaborative efforts between philanthropy and corporate social responsibility to effect meaningful change in mental health discourse and access to resources. Following are the excerpts from the interaction. 1. Mental health is a cause close to your heart. Could you share with us ways in which philanthropy can support the cause of mental health? Yes, mental health is indeed a topic that has gained significant attention lately, but my personal journey as a caregiver has truly emphasized the depth of understanding needed in this area. Through my experiences, I’ve come to realize the importance of being better prepared and the crucial need for support. It’s a cause very close to my heart, especially in terms of philanthropy. I firmly believe in the power of collaborative action across various sectors, not just limited to mental health but also including education, healthcare, and women’s empowerment. Working together can yield the best results. Philanthropy, in my view, extends beyond financial contributions. It involves partnering with individuals and organizations, sharing expertise, and problem-solving collectively. While financial support is vital, it’s just one aspect of philanthropy. It’s about working together towards a common goal. 2. Beyond awareness campaigns, the Live Love Laugh Foundation emphasizes actionable philanthropy. Can you elaborate on the specific areas within mental health that you believe need increased investment? From a foundation perspective, we center our efforts on what we call the three A’s: awareness, accessibility, and affordability. While there has been an increase in awareness about mental health in India over the past seven to eight years, there’s still a significant distance to cover. Access to mental health professionals and credible information remains a challenge. With the abundance of information available today, distinguishing between what is verified and what isn’t is crucial. Affordability is another key concern, affecting both rural and urban areas. Beyond these, the importance of philanthropy, both financial and otherwise, cannot be overstated. Additionally, there is a pressing need for more research specific to India’s context. While some research exists, there is a considerable gap that needs to be addressed in the field of mental health. These are the areas where support and assistance are greatly needed. 3. The shortage of mental health professionals is a significant challenge in many countries. From your perspective, what are the key obstacles, and how do you see the gap being addressed in terms of human resources for mental health? The shortage of mental health professionals is indeed a significant challenge, particularly in densely populated countries like India. When addressing this issue, it’s crucial to identify key obstacles and develop strategies to bridge the gap in human resources for mental health. One approach that I believe holds promise, especially in a collectivist society like India, is a community-based approach. By training a large number of individuals within communities, alongside specialists, we can begin to address the shortage more effectively. Currently, India has only about eight or nine thousand psychiatrists, along with a limited number of other mental health professionals. With the increasing number of individuals seeking help for mental illness, it’s clear that traditional approaches alone are insufficient. Training lay counselors and community-based workers is essential to expand outreach and support. In our rural programs, we prioritize training for implementation partners and frontline workers such as ASHA and Anganwadi workers to enhance community-based mental health support. This grassroots approach is vital for reaching a larger portion of the population and reducing the gap in mental health resources. 4. The Live Love Laugh Foundation has been actively involved in various initiatives. Could you share some success stories or impactful interventions that highlight the foundation’s commitment to making a tangible difference in the field of mental health? Our organization, founded on the core belief that no life should be lost due to mental illness, has witnessed remarkable successes since its inception in 2015. One poignant example is the story of a young girl who, in a moment of despair, reached out to one of our helpline partners after visiting our website. Through timely intervention, including contacting her family and dispatching an ambulance, we were able to save her life. This story epitomizes the impact our organization, Live, Laugh, Love, can have in preventing tragedies and reaffirms our commitment to our core belief. Another inspiring success story stems from our rural program intervention in Avangiri, Karnataka. A man who suffered a severe mental illness following a serious accident found hope and rehabilitation through our program. With the right treatment and support, his condition stabilized, and he now leads a fulfilling life, engaging in vocational training and contributing to his community. His journey, along with his mother’s transformation into a parent champion, illustrates the ripple effect of our interventions, inspiring others in their community. These are just a few examples of the countless lives touched by our work. We have received heartfelt gratitude from individuals whose lives we’ve impacted, and our efforts have been recognized through prestigious awards over the years. Each success story, whether shared anonymously or celebrated publicly, underscores the importance of our mission and drives us to continue our advocacy and support for mental health. 5. In the context of mental health, what, in your opinion, are the most critical policy changes or legislative measures that would contribute significantly to the improvement of mental health services and awareness in our society? The passing of the Mental Health Care Act in 2017 marked a significant milestone for the mental health industry in India. This robust legislation not only addresses various approaches to mental healthcare but also emphasizes the rights of individuals with mental illness. Decriminalizing suicide and mandating mental health care insurance were pivotal steps forward outlined in the act. However, the key lies in its implementation on the ground. This presents an opportunity for organizations like ours to collaborate with stakeholders and ensure the effective execution of the act’s recommendations. Moving forward, there are several measures needed to further improve mental health services in India. First and foremost, there is a need to ensure that insurance companies comply with the act, providing coverage for mental health treatment on par with physical illness. Standardizing the recognition and qualifications of non-medical mental health professionals such as counselors and psychologists is another crucial area that requires attention. The government’s initiative, Tele-Manas, introduced two years ago, is a commendable step towards providing essential intervention and counseling support. Capacity building remains a pressing challenge, highlighting the need for investment in training and developing mental health professionals. Additionally, while progress has been made in research, there is still a long way to go. Continued efforts to raise awareness, combat stigma, and promote destigmatization are essential in advancing mental health initiatives in the country. These broader themes must remain at the forefront of our collective efforts as we strive for better mental health outcomes for all individuals in India. 6. There’s a growing global conversation about destigmatizing mental health issues. How does Live Love Laugh Foundation contribute to this conversation, and what do you think are the most effective ways to challenge and overcome mental health stigma in our communities? When we launched our organization in 2015, our primary focus was on raising awareness and destigmatizing mental illness. While these remain crucial aspects of our work, we have also expanded our efforts to include improving access to mental health services and making them more affordable. For the past five to seven years, we have been consistently dedicated to activities aimed at building awareness and reducing stigma surrounding mental health. Understanding the multifaceted nature of stigma is essential. Stigma exists at various levels, including individual, familial, community, and organizational levels. To effectively address stigma, it’s crucial to identify the target audience and tailor interventions accordingly. For instance, in urban areas where our target demographic is typically younger individuals, digital mediums such as websites and social media platforms have proven to be effective channels for outreach. However, strategies must be adapted when working in rural areas, where community-led and on-the-ground approaches are more effective. Consistency is key in stigma reduction efforts. We have learned through experience that sustained, ongoing efforts yield the best results. Over the past seven to eight years, we have remained steadfast in our commitment to combating stigma, which has proven to be a successful approach. 7. Mental health challenges often intersect with social and economic factors. How does the Live Love Laugh Foundation approach these intersections in its programs? Our rural program is built on the foundation of providing affordable mental health care. This initiative stemmed from our belief that mental illness can affect individuals from any background and should not be constrained by socioeconomic barriers. It was essential for us to extend our services beyond urban areas to rural communities, ensuring equitable access to mental health support across the country. In our rural program, all interventions are offered free of cost to beneficiaries. This includes medication, treatment, mental health camps, vocational training, advocacy, and community-building activities. We are committed to ensuring that financial constraints do not hinder individuals from accessing the care they need. Similarly, our helpline numbers, which are available 24/7 and offer counseling in multiple languages, provide a vital lifeline for those in need of immediate support, all at no cost to the caller. Additionally, we are actively engaged in advocacy efforts aimed at addressing policy-level barriers to affordability in mental health care. While I cannot delve into specific details at this time, these endeavors are aimed at creating systemic changes that will contribute to the affordability of mental health services in the long term. Through these various initiatives, we are working tirelessly to make mental health care accessible and affordable for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status or geographic location. 8. With Deepika Padukone being a well-known figure and your sister, and Prakash Padukone, your father, having significant influence in their respective fields, how do you leverage their platforms and experiences to amplify the message and impact of Live Love Laugh Foundation’s initiatives, especially in the context of mental health awareness and destigmatization? Yes, indeed. Deepika, as the founder of Live Love Laugh, has played a pivotal role in breaking the silence surrounding mental health through her courageous advocacy efforts. One significant moment that stands out is her interview with Barkha Dutt on NDTV in 2014. It was a landmark event, marking the first time a public figure of her stature openly discussed mental health on national television. At the time, mental illness was a taboo subject, and Deepika’s decision to speak out was bold and groundbreaking. However, in hindsight, it proved to be a catalyst for change, opening the door for others to share their struggles and seek help. This interview was instrumental in raising awareness and destigmatizing mental health issues, inspiring countless individuals to confront their own challenges. It demonstrated the power of leveraging a celebrity’s platform to drive positive change and encourage dialogue around mental health. While Deepika’s influence has been invaluable in amplifying the message, it’s essential to recognize that mental illness affects people from all walks of life. As such, our foundation has worked diligently to strike a balance between leveraging her visibility and amplifying diverse voices. Over time, our initiatives have evolved to include narratives from individuals across various backgrounds, fostering a sense of community and empowerment. Through this balanced approach, we aim to create a domino effect, where each courageous story shared inspires others to speak out and seek support. By continuing to highlight diverse perspectives and experiences, we can collectively break down barriers and create a more inclusive environment for mental health discourse."

    "article_content": "It is no longer enough for businesses to simply buy and sell their products and services without considering the world in which they operate. The term “corporate social responsibility” came into common use in the late 1960s and early 1970s after many multinational corporations formed the term stakeholders, which meant those on whom organization activities have an impact. It was used to describe corporate owners beyond shareholders as a result of an influential book by R. Edward Freeman, Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach in 1984. Companies must voluntarily do business in an economically, socially and environmentally responsible manner to be sustainable over a long period of time. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) refers to business practices involving initiatives that benefit society. Sunil Misser, Head of Global Sustainability Practice, PwC said, “Corporate social responsibility is not just about managing, reducing and avoiding risk, it is about creating opportunities, generating improved performance, making money and leaving the risks far behind.” According to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Corporate Social Responsibility is defined as a business management concept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and interactions with their stakeholders. CSR is generally understood as being the way through which a company achieves a balance of economic, environmental and social imperatives, while at the same time addressing the expectations of shareholders and stakeholders. The distinction between CSR and Philanthropy/Charity is that CSR is part of a business strategy. Business operations, supply chain, and human resource are all affected by a company’s CSR policy, which is not true for its philanthropic work. The goal of CSR is to embrace responsibility for the company’s actions and encourage a positive impact through its activities on the environment, consumers, employees, communities, stakeholders and all other members of the public sphere. CSR has been intrinsic to Indian culture since ancient times. The concept of CSR has been visible in Mauryan history as well where philosophers like Kautilya emphasized on ethical practices and principles while conducting business. CSR has been informally practised in ancient times in the form of charity to the poor and disadvantaged. Indian scriptures have also mentioned the importance of sharing one’s earning with the deprived section of society. In India, religion has also played a major role in promoting the concept of responsibility of businesses and citizens towards nature, animals and disadvantaged sections of the society. India being an agro-based country after the independence, followed such an economic model that the village as a unit was self-sufficient in every sense. The traders, farmers and the artisans ensured that there was enough employment, food and shelter for every individual of the village. No individual would go hungry or shelter-less. The community was strong enough to look after each other as well as the biodiversity around them. This trait started reflecting in bigger businesses as they emerged. The businesses essentially invested in the community surrounding them, their wellness as well as their happiness. This was a way of the businessmen to give back to the community, and it was profitable to the business itself as happy and healthy employees equal good business productivity. With the advent of the industrial revolution, industrialist families such as Tatas, Birlas, Modis, Godrej, Bajajs and Singhanias supported and spent huge amounts for public welfare under their CSR expenditure, by setting up foundations, educational institutions and healthcare organisations. The concept of trusteeship provided by Mahatma Gandhi further imprinted CSR in the DNAs of Indian business leaders of the time. According to this concept, capitalists should act as trustees (not owners) of their property and conduct themselves in a socially responsible way. Mahatma said, “ Supposing I have come by a fair amount of wealth—either by way of legacy or by means of trade and industry—I must know that all that wealth does not belong to me; what belongs to me is the right to an honourable livelihood, no better than that enjoyed by millions of others. The rest of my wealth belongs to the community and must be used for the welfare of the community. ” The evolution of CSR has been very intrinsic to the cultural development and evolution of Indian society. This is why it was not very difficult for India Inc. to accept mandatory CSR law. India became the first country in the world to make CSR compulsory. In India, Corporate Social Responsibility has been made mandatory through provisions under Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013. According to the law, a company needs to spend at least 2% of their average net profit made during the 3 immediately preceding financial years for CSR activities. The CSR law or more popularly known as the CSR mandate, which came into effect from April 2014, applies to every company registered under the Companies Act, 2013, and any other previous companies law qualifying following conditions. – Having a net worth of rupees five hundred crores or more, or – Having a turnover of rupees one thousand crores or more, or – Having a net profit of rupees five crores or more, during a financial year. The eligible companies are required to formulate a CSR Committee, in order to carry out the programs or activities as approved by the Committee. The programs or activities under CSR in India are carried out through a registered trust, society or company. As per the law, the CSR activities that only benefit employees of the companies and their families do not qualify as CSR expenditure. In case a company fails to spend the said amount within a year, it will have to transfer the unutilised CSR funds to an escrow account and ensure its utilisation within three years. If a company fails to do even that, it will have to transfer the balance amount to the National CSR Fund. Since its rollout in 2014, CSR expenditure in India has continued to increase year-on-year. In fact, in the year 2017-2018, for the first time, the amount spent by companies exceeded the prescribed expenditure. The cumulative expenditure by the top-100 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange from 2014-2015 to 2017-2018 is about Rs. 26,385 crore as per the KPMG Report. Sectors such as health and sanitation, rural development, education and environment, have recorded the highest number of funds. The implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility in India has brought various socio-economic and political challenges to good governance under one umbrella and sought for interventions by India Inc. to address the same. While the Act itself has facilitated this process, India Inc. continues to explore the difference in their own style of business and what they are expected as part of CSR in India. At the same time, CSR has also become a space for active policy practitioners and social impact organisations that are trying to find their space in different ways. According to the law, the contribution of any amount directly or indirectly to any political party, shall not be considered as CSR activity in India. Similarly, the CSR projects or programs or activities that benefit only the employees of the company and their families shall not be considered as CSR activities. In addition to this, any activity which is not in the form of a project cannot be qualified as CSR of a company. Similarly, any CSR project which has not officially been approved by the board cannot qualify as a CSR initiative of that organisation. No initiative can be claimed successful or unsuccessful as long as there is a scale to measure it against. Impact measurement is extremely important in CSR considering the large amount of funds that are involved in it. There is no standard framework provided by the law for impact measurement of a company’s CSR. This provides corporates with ample space to frame their own impact measurement strategies. In order to maintain transparency in the CSR spending, the companies also indulge in reporting of their CSR initiatives. This allows the critical eye of the media to inspect and investigate the real impact of a CSR initiative. The CSR mandate is a celebrated law in India. Year over year, the companies have spent more than 2% of their net profits over CSR. The businesses have moved beyond signing cheques for charitable causes and are taking an active interest in causes such as skill training, healthcare, ethical business operations, environmental sustainability among others. More than 50,000 crore rupees have been spent on CSR by March 2019 since the enactment of the CSR law. However, it has been observed that the amount spent is concentrated in a few states, leaving out the states that require more development in India. Additionally, the sector-wise spend too is not linear with some sectors taking away a larger share of the funds than others. This has brought about discrepancies in national development. Additionally, government interference sometimes causes a slowdown in CSR projects. This is a major contradiction of the intent behind the law. In order to make the CSR law success and optimally utilise the CSR funds for the social and economic development of the country, these loopholes need to be addressed. According to the 8th schedule of the Companies Act 2013, the types of CSR activities that are qualified under the act for the companies to contribute to are: 1. Eradicating Hunger, Poverty and Malnutrition 2. Promoting Education 3. Promoting Gender Equality 4. CSR initiatives related to the environment 5. Protection of national heritage, art and culture 6. Measures can be taken for the benefit and support of armed forces veterans, war widows and families 7. Contributions to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund or any other fund set up by the central government, for welfare, development and relief of the scheduled caste, tribes, other backward classes, women and minorities. 8. Contributions or funds provided to the development of technology located within the central government approved academic institutions. 9. Contributions can be made towards rural development projects and slum area development. CSR initiatives by India Inc. is officially recognised by the government of India through National CSR Awards . The Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India has instituted National Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Awards to recognize companies that have made a positive impact on the society through their innovative & sustainable CSR initiatives. The objectives of the National CSR Awards include: – Recognize the companies that have positively impacted both business and society by taking a strategic approach to CSR through a collaborative program. – Recognize the companies that are leading transformation by integrating sustainability in their core business model. – Recognize companies for implementing measures for conservation and sustainable management of the biodiversity and ecosystem in the value chain. – Identifying innovative approaches and employing applications and technologies that will help to build robust CSR programs to further the cause of inclusive and sustainable development. In addition to this, each year, The CSR Journal conducts The CSR Journal Excellence Awards in order to recognise the CSR initiatives by India Inc. India is a vast country with a huge population density. It houses the largest number of people living below the poverty line. This is why there is always a shortage of resources and fight for it. Most numbers of polluted cities in the world are in India. This has a major impact on the health of the people living in the country. In lieu of these social issues, India is a welfare state. The government keeps making initiatives to aid the poor of the country. Education, health, clean environment, safe place of work have all been recognised as fundamental rights of citizens as per the constitution of India. However, there are always gaps in the government service, which is why often it is unable to benefit all the poor people at the ground level at the right time. The CSR law works towards filling these gaps. With its expertise in organisational skills, a CSR initiative works in an efficient manner, ensuring that the beneficiaries are affected precisely at the right time. It helps in the holistic development of a society. Other than this Corporate Social Responsibility also plays a major role in maintaining the communitarian spirit of the country. It encourages participation from all sections of society. It indulges different kinds of organisations in a collaborative framework with a common goal of development. It encourages in developing the spirit of nationalism among the capitalists as well as the community. CSR plays a major role in addressing the mental health of office going young population of the country. CSR initiatives of a company allow employee participation, which in turn, can work wonders for team building, inculcating leadership and imbibing a sense of responsibility. The happiness factor is a bonus to this. It also plays a major role in bringing about financial inclusion, social inclusion, education and behavioural change among people of India. While the government can formulate policies for various issues, it is CSR that brings about acceptance of the laws among people. Corporate Social Responsibility has an opportunity to support the innovative minds of the country as per the law. It can, therefore, support various start-ups in India who can generate more employment as well as solve the social problems of the country. Most importantly, it encourages the youth to take more risks to work to fulfil their dreams along with others and contribute to national development. Niall Fitzerald, Former CEO, Unilever said, “Corporate social responsibility is a hard-edged business decision. Not because it is a nice thing to do or because people are forcing us to do it… because it is good for our business.” CSR of a company is managed by the brightest minds. A company who is spending a large amount of its funds wants to always ensure that their money is spent well, out of force of habit. In order to achieve this, it is executed by learned and experienced people. Therefore, it has a huge responsibility and scope for the future. While India is growing at a rapid pace, it is not doing very well in the field of research. Investment in research in education, technology, medicine, space technology, policy formulation and so on is required to encourage indigenous solutions for indigenous problems. CSR can become a cause of revolution in the field of research. India suffers from the problem of brain-drain. CSR has the potential to prevent that from happening. CSR can play a significant role in addressing the problem of interoperability among government agencies. This will, in turn, improve the efficiency of government services. CSR has an opportunity to encourage the informal sector as well as the citizens to indulge in social as well as national development. It can work towards helping the citizens of India realise and act upon their fundamental duties and thus educate the population on being responsible citizens."

    "article_content": "India is one of the most “dynamic emerging economies” and is likely to grow at 7.7 percent this year on strong private demand and government reforms but excluding the effect of demonetisation, a UN report said today. It said demonetisation undertaken in India will have a “significant impact” on consumer spending in the short term but the country’s economy will return to the about 7.6-7.7 percent growth. When asked as to why the UN has not taken into account demonetisation impact on growth forecast, Economic Affairs Officer at UN ESCAP Matthew Hammil said: “The UN report was prepared in late November, then finalised in December.” Going forward, he said, the growth rate for India is expected to be slower than what is projected now, taking into account the demonetisation factor. According to the United Nations World Economic Situation and Progress (WESP) report released here today, the country’s economy is likely to expand at about 7.6 percent in 2018. “India has positioned itself as one of the most dynamic emerging economies. Growth is projected to reach 7.7 percent in 2017 and 7.6 percent in 2018 amid strong private consumption,” said the report. It expects a slight pick-up in investment demand supported by monetary easing, government efforts towards infrastructure investments and public-private partnerships and domestic reforms. Earlier this month, without taking into account the demonetisation impact, India projected the economy to grow at a slower pace of 7.1 percent in 2016-17 — as against 7.6 percent in the previous fiscal — on poor manufacturing, mining and construction sector activities. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday cut the growth rate to 6.6 percent as against its earlier estimate of 7.6 percent citing temporary negative consumption shock due to demonetisation. World Bank has also said that an immediate withdrawal of a large volume of currency in circulation and subsequent replacement with new notes announced by the government in November contributed to India’s slowing growth in 2016. On the global economic situation, the UN report said it is trapped in a self-perpetuating cycle of weak investment, dwindling world trade, flagging productivity growth and high debt which is hampering progress in reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). “The world economy is projected to grow by 2.7 percent in 2017 and 2.9 percent in 2018, remaining below the average growth of 3.4 percent in the decade prior to the global financial crisis,” it said. The eastern and south Asian countries are the world’s most dynamic regions currently, said the report, adding robust domestic demand and supportive macro-economic polices are benefiting these nations. Developing countries remain the main drivers of global growth, accounting to about 60 percent of the world gross product growth in 2016-18, said the report. However,to address global challenges, it highlighted greater international policy cooperation and coordination, as well as steps to mitigate negative spillover effects of macroeconomic policies for a fair and equitable global trade. Clean technology transfer and climate financing need to be expediting to tide over these challenges, the report said, adding that there is also a need to strengthen international tax cooperation. Also, there are challenges posed by large movements of refugees and migrants which need to be addressed, the UN study said. ( Economic Times ) Thank you for reading the story until the very end. We appreciate the time you have given us. In addition, your thoughts and inputs will genuinely make a difference to us. Please do drop in a line and help us do better. Regards, The CSR Journal Team"

    "article_content": "Every year, June 4th is observed as the International Day of Innocent Children Victims of Aggression. The day is a grim reminder of innumerable children across the world who suffer due to various forms of violence and aggression. The United Nations established the day in 1982 to respond to the atrocities committed against Palestinian and Lebanese children during the Israel-Lebanon conflict. Every day, children living in wars across the globe face unspeakable horrors. They are not safe while doing normal life things like sleeping in their homes or playing outside, learning in school or seeking medical care at hospitals. From killing and maiming, abduction and sexual violence, to attacks on education and health facilities, and the denial of the humanitarian assistance that they desperately need, children are subjected to undeserving fate at the behest of warring parties at a staggering scale. The UN Secretary-General Annual Report on Children and Armed Conflict highlights that in 2022 alone: – Over 8,630 children were killed or maimed, a 5% increase compared to 2021. The use of explosive ordnance, including explosive remnants of war, improvised explosive devices, and landmines, was responsible for over 25% of the killing and maiming of children. – 7,622 children were recruited or used in conflicts, with 85% of these being boys. Factors such as sex, age, disability, ethnicity, religion, geopolitical location, and economic status primarily determine a child’s risk of recruitment and the violations they experience. – 3,985 children were abducted, with the highest numbers occurring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, Burkina Faso, Myanmar, and Mozambique. – 1,166 children were victims of sexual violence, with 99% of cases perpetrated against girls, who are disproportionately affected by such violence. – 3,931 incidents of denial of humanitarian access were reported, with the most affected areas being Israel and the State of Palestine, Yemen, Afghanistan, Mali, and Burkina Faso. – 1,846 incidents of attacks on schools and hospitals were verified, showing a sharp increase of over 110%, with a significant rise in the use of schools and hospitals for military purposes. These alarming statistics reveal the severe impact of conflict on children, emphasising the urgent need to protect and support them. One essential way to provide this support is through the presence of child counselors in schools. Child counselors play a crucial role in helping children cope with trauma, stress, and emotional difficulties. They provide a safe space for children to express their feelings and thoughts, helping them to navigate through complex emotions and experiences. This support is not only vital for children in conflict zones but also for those facing everyday challenges. However, the reality in Indian schools reveals a significant gap between this necessity and its implementation. The Role of Child Counsellors Child counselors are trained professionals who specialise in understanding and addressing the emotional, psychological, and social needs of children. They provide a safe space for children to express their feelings and thoughts, helping them to navigate through complex emotions and experiences. The benefits of having child counselors in schools are manifold: 1. Emotional Support: Counselors offer emotional support to children who may be dealing with personal issues, family problems, or bullying. This support is crucial for their mental well-being. 2. Behavioral Guidance: They help children develop healthy coping mechanisms and positive behavior patterns, which can lead to better academic and social outcomes. 3. Early Intervention: Counselors can identify signs of mental health issues early on and provide timely intervention, preventing more serious problems from developing. 4. Safe Environment: They contribute to creating a safe and nurturing school environment where children feel valued and understood. The Reality in Indian Schools The Central Board of Secondary Education has issued a guideline making it mandatory to have counsellors in schools. Despite this, only three per cent of private schools in the country have counselling services, as per a report by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM). The situation in the government schools is far worse. Many Indian schools, especially in rural areas, operate with limited resources. They struggle to provide basic infrastructure, let alone specialised services like counseling. The focus often remains on academic achievement, with little attention given to mental health and emotional well-being. Moreover, there is a significant shortage of trained child counsellors in India. The demand far exceeds the supply, and many schools cannot afford to hire full-time counselors. In some cases, teachers or staff members with little to no training in counseling are asked to fill this role, which can be ineffective and potentially harmful. Mental health issues and counseling still carry a stigma in many parts of India. Parents and even educators may be reluctant to seek help for children, fearing social ostracism or labeling. This cultural barrier prevents many children from accessing the support they need. Steps Towards Improvement To bridge the gap between the need for child counselors and the current reality in Indian schools, several steps can be taken: 1. Government Initiatives: The government must prioritise mental health in education policies and allocate funds specifically for counselling services. Programs like the National Mental Health Programme can be expanded to include a focus on school counselling. 2. Training and Recruitment: There should be increased efforts to train and recruit more child counsellors. Offering incentives and scholarships for students pursuing careers in child psychology and counselling can help address the shortage of professionals. 3. Awareness Campaigns: Public awareness campaigns can help reduce the stigma associated with mental health. Educating parents, teachers, and students about the importance of mental well-being and the role of counselors can create a more supportive environment. 4. Collaboration with NGOs: Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) can play a crucial role in filling the gaps. Collaborations between schools and NGOs can provide access to counseling services, especially in under-resourced areas. 5. Integration into Curriculum: Mental health education should be integrated into the school curriculum. Teaching children about emotional intelligence, resilience, and coping strategies can empower them to seek help when needed. Conclusion The International Day of Innocent Children Victims of Aggression reminds us of our collective responsibility to protect and support the children in our communities. Child counselors in schools are a vital component of this support system, providing essential services that can significantly impact a child’s development and well-being. While the current reality in Indian schools falls short of this ideal, concerted efforts from the government, educators, and society at large can pave the way for a brighter, healthier future for our children. By prioritising mental health and ensuring the presence of child counselors in every school, we can create a more nurturing and supportive environment for all children to thrive."

    "article_content": "In a significant ruling, the Supreme Court has expanded the scope of Articles 14 and 21 to include the “right against the adverse effects of climate change”. “Article 48A of the Constitution provides that the State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country. Clause (g) of Article 51A stipulates that it shall be the duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures. Although these are not justiciable provisions of the Constitution, they are indications that the Constitution recognises the importance of the natural world,” a three-judge bench presided by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud has said. “The importance of the environment, as indicated by these provisions, becomes a right in other parts of the Constitution. Article 21 recognises the right to life and personal liberty while Article 14 indicates that all persons shall have equality before law and the equal protection of laws. These Articles are important sources of the right to a clean environment and the right against the adverse effects of climate change,” it said. The Supreme Court has, from time to time, expanded the fundamental rights chapter to include various facets of a dignified existence. However, this is the first time that it has included the “right against the adverse effects of climate change”. Although the bench, which included Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, issued the ruling on March 21st, the comprehensive order was only posted online on Saturday evening. “Despite governmental policy and rules and regulations recognising the adverse effects of climate change and seeking to combat it, there is no single or umbrella legislation in India which relates to climate change and the attendant concerns,” the court noted. “However, this does not mean that the people of India do not have a right against the adverse effects of climate change,” it added. On the right to a clean environment, the court said: “Without a clean environment which is stable and unimpacted by the vagaries of climate change, the right to life is not fully realised. The right to health (which is a part of the right to life under Article 21) is impacted due to factors such as air pollution, shifts in vector-borne diseases, rising temperatures, droughts, shortages in food supplies due to crop failure, storms and flooding. The inability of underserved communities to adapt to climate change or cope with its effects violates the right to life (Article 21) as well as the right to equality (Article 14).” The Conflict between Protection of Great Indian Bustard vs Transitioning to Clean Energy The bench presided over a case concerning the protection of the Great Indian Bustard (GIB) habitat from the encroachment of power transmission lines. On April 19, 2021, the Supreme Court directed restrictions on the establishment of overhead transmission lines spanning approximately 99,000 square kilometers. Additionally, it proposed the conversion of overhead low and high voltage lines to underground power lines. Following this, the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change, along with the Ministry of Power and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, petitioned the Supreme Court for a modification of its directives. They argued that India had made international commitments regarding the shift to non-fossil fuels and emission reduction. Furthermore, they emphasized the substantial solar and wind energy potential within the specified area. The feasibility of burying high voltage power lines underground was also questioned. Acknowledging these concerns, the bench granted the request, citing various practical challenges such as technical complexities, land acquisition hurdles, and exorbitant expenses associated with implementing the initial order. Writing on behalf of the bench, the Chief Justice also underscored the significance of climate change jurisprudence and emphasized the imperative to harness renewable energy sources, particularly solar power. Moreover, he emphasized the necessity to strike a balance between conserving the GIB and safeguarding the environment as a whole. “A blanket direction for undergrounding high voltage and low voltage power lines of the nature that was directed by this Court would need recalibration,” the court said. It set up a nine-member committee of experts to “assess the feasibility of undergrounding power lines in specific areas, considering factors such as terrain, population density and infrastructure requirements”. It also asked the committee “to complete its task and submit a report to this court through the Union Government on or before July 31, 2024”. The court pointed out that India aimed to achieve an installed renewable energy capacity (excluding large hydro) of 175 GW (Gigawatts) by 2022, a goal that signified the country’s commitment to clean energy adoption, and the future goal is 450 GW installed capacity by 2030. “To achieve these targets, India has implemented various policy measures and initiatives to promote renewable energy investment, innovation and adoption,” it said, adding that the Centre’s affidavit in the case highlighted how India’s commitment to transition to non-fossil fuels is not just a strategic energy goal but a fundamental necessity for environmental preservation. “Investing in renewable energy not only addresses these urgent environmental concerns but also yields a plethora of socio-economic benefits,” it said. “The promotion of renewable energy sources plays a crucial role in promoting social equity by ensuring access to clean and affordable energy for all segments of society, especially in rural and underserved areas. This contributes to poverty alleviation, enhances quality of life, and fosters inclusive growth and development across the nation. Therefore, transitioning to renewable energy is not just an environmental imperative but also a strategic investment in India’s future prosperity, resilience and sustainability,” the bench said. Spotlight on Relationship between Climate Change and Human Rights “Of late, the intersection between climate change and human rights has been put in sharp focus, underscoring the imperative for states to address climate impacts through the lens of rights,” the bench said. Stating that “states owe a duty of care to citizens to prevent harm and to ensure overall well-being”, it added: “The right to a healthy and clean environment is undoubtedly a part of this duty of care. States are compelled to take effective measures to mitigate climate change and ensure that all individuals have the necessary capacity to adapt to the climate crisis”. Importance of Harnessing Solar Energy “It is essential to harness power from sources of renewable energy in Rajasthan and Gujarat to meet the rising power demand in the country in an expeditious and sustainable manner. This is also necessitated by India’s international commitments with respect to climate change,” it said. Discussing the importance of solar energy “as a pivotal solution in the global transition towards cleaner energy sources”, the bench said that “India urgently needs to shift to solar power due to three impending issues”. “Firstly, India is likely to account for 25% of global energy demand growth over the next two decades, necessitating a move towards solar for enhanced energy security and self-sufficiency while mitigating environmental impacts. Failure to do so may increase dependence on coal and oil, leading to economic and environmental costs,” it said. “Secondly, rampant air pollution emphasises the need for cleaner energy sources like solar to combat pollution caused by fossil fuels. Lastly, declining groundwater levels and decreasing annual rainfall underscore the importance of diversifying energy sources. Solar power, unlike coal, does not strain groundwater supplies. The extensive use of solar power plants is a crucial step towards cleaner, cheaper, and sustainable energy,” the bench said. Pointing to technical challenges in implementing the April 2021 order, the SC said that underground power transmission cables are available only in 400 KV with lengths of 250 metre, which would mean more joints leading to leaks. The transmission loss in such cables is about five times higher as they don’t efficiently transmit AC power, it said. Also, the Electricity Act does not contemplate the acquisition of land for laying underground cables, while overhead transmission lines require only the right of way, the bench said, adding that it may also lead to environmental issues for many vulnerable species and result in forest fires etc."

Among the top three spenders was Jindal Aluminium Limited, making a significant contribution of Rs. 30.39 crore towards the betterment of communities and the conservation of resources. Top CSR Projects in Karnataka Seed-to-mouth initiative by Herbalife Herbalife India, a global health and wellness company, partnered with Sambhav Foundation, a non-profit organization, to train and empower farmers in India as part of its CSR initiative. Through Herbalife’s Seed-to-Mouth initiative, the organization has strengthened the farming capabilities of over 9,300 farmers across India. In line with Herbalife’s commitment to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the comprehensive training program has transformed over 25,000 households across 84 villages in Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh. The project was implemented across major districts such as Ajmer (Rajasthan), Vijayapura (Karnataka), and Vidisha (Madhya Pradesh), equipping the farming community with cutting-edge agricultural learning resources, reducing operating costs, and enabling market reach to enhance their income generation. Since its launch in July 2022, the Seed-to-Mouth initiative has enhanced sector access for farmers by connecting them with major industry players, enabling them to reach a wider customer base and expand their market reach. The NGO conducted a diagnostic study in consultation with over 50 agri-experts across the states to identify and address existing gaps in agricultural practices by providing farmers with essential resources such as seeds, equipment, fertilizers, and loans. Farmers also gained practical knowledge on essential topics such as advanced farming technology, crop diversification, safe use of chemicals, land management, credit support, and market access through collaboration with Krishi Vigyan Kendras and university incubators. Expert-led awareness sessions on farming and irrigation supported farmers throughout the farming process. Rejuvenation of Hunasamaranahalli Lake by Lowe’s India Lowe’s India announced the successful rejuvenation of the Hunasamaranahalli Lake in the north of Bengaluru. The project began in 2022, in partnership with Oasis Foundation and HandsonCSR. The Hunasamaranahalli Lake, near the Bengaluru International Airport, was home to migratory birds, a huge population of fish, snakes and turtles, primarily. However, with a fast-growing neighborhood, the lake started to suffer from soil erosion, depleting water retention capacity and garbage accumulation. As part of the rejuvenation, Lowe’s India supported a number of enhancements including de-silting, the addition of bunds around the lake, the planting of 1000-plus trees and flowering plants, refurbishment of inlet and outlet sources and the creation of a new walking and cycling path along the lake’s perimeter. Additionally, Lowe’s India associates led cleanup drives, including garbage collection and weed removal, in areas surrounding the lake. The rejuvenated lake is expected to bring back lost biodiversity in the surrounding areas and save more than 3,00,015.9Kgs of CO2 by 2043. It has already started attracting butterflies, birds and other smaller creatures. More than 500 people visit the lake daily. DIKSHa Program by Dalmia Bharat Dalmia Bharat Foundation (DBF), the CSR arm of Dalmia Bharat Ltd initiated DIKSHa program in 2016 in partnership with the National Skill Development Corporation. DIKSHa is dedicated to enabling skill development and sustainable livelihoods for disadvantaged youth in rural communities in India. In a country with the youngest and largest workforce in the world, India faces the challenge of significant skill gaps, with only 5% of the workforce recognized as formally skilled. Addressing this concern, DBF via DIKSHa provides placement-linked, short-term skill training to youth and women, adding them to skilled workforce for enhanced income. DIKSHa primarily focuses on training unemployed youth or youth with limited prospects by enhancing their employability through skill development. DIKSHa offers training in a wide range of areas, including healthcare, industrial sewing machine operator, assistant electrician, customer relationship management, sales and marketing, data entry operator, beauty and wellness, and unarmed security. Till date, DIKSHa has trained 11647 individuals successfully with more than 8271 individuals placed in gainful employment, earning monthly wages ranging from INR 8,000 to INR 20,000."

    "article_content": "In a recently published report, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has shed light on a growing concern in India – the alarming rise in road accidents and fatalities. The “Road Accidents in India-2022” report paints a grim picture of the state of road safety in the country. As we delve into the report’s findings, it becomes evident that immediate action is required to address this pressing issue and save lives on India’s roads. A Sobering Reality The report reveals sobering statistics that reflect the magnitude of the road safety challenge facing India. In 2022, the country witnessed a staggering 4,61,312 road accidents, resulting in a tragic toll of 1,68,491 fatalities and leaving 4,43,366 individuals injured. These figures signify an 11.9% year-on-year increase in accidents, a 9.4% rise in fatalities, and a 15.3% surge in the number of people injured compared to the previous year. A Troubling Distribution The report also provides insights into where these accidents are most prevalent. National Highways and Expressways accounted for 32.9% of accidents, with State Highways following closely at 23.1%. The remaining 43.9% of accidents occurred on other roads. Fatalities echoed a similar trend, with 36.2% on National Highways and 24.3% on State Highways. A Demographic Impact Perhaps one of the most distressing aspects of this issue is its impact on young adults. In 2022, individuals in the 18-45 age group accounted for a staggering 66.5% of the victims. Furthermore, those in the working-age group of 18-60 years constituted a heartbreaking 83.4% of the total road accident fatalities. The data also highlights significant disparities between urban and rural areas. Approximately 68% of road accident deaths occurred in rural regions, underscoring the need for targeted interventions in these areas. Urban areas contributed 32% to the total accident deaths. The Most Vulnerable When it comes to road users, two-wheeler riders continue to be the most vulnerable, representing the highest share in total fatalities, at 44.5%. Pedestrians are the second-largest group, accounting for 19.5% of fatalities. State-Specific Insights The report provides state-specific data, shedding light on which regions are most affected. Tamil Nadu recorded the highest number of road accidents in 2022, making up 13.9% of the total accidents. It was closely followed by Madhya Pradesh at 11.8%. In terms of fatalities, Uttar Pradesh topped the list with 13.4%, followed by Tamil Nadu at 10.6%. Understanding these state-specific trends is crucial for implementing targeted interventions. An International Perspective On the global stage, India holds a troubling distinction. It has the highest number of total persons killed due to road accidents, surpassing even China and the United States. Venezuela, meanwhile, tops the chart for the rate of persons killed per 1,00,000 population. The State of the Indian Road Network India’s road network serves as the lifeblood of the nation, connecting its diverse regions. The report highlights some key aspects of the road network: – India’s road density stands at 1,926.02 per 1,000 sq.km of area in 2018-19, surpassing that of many developed countries. However, only 64.7% of roads are surfaced or paved, lagging behind developed nations. – National Highways make up a mere 2.09% of the total road length in 2019, with the majority comprising State Highways, District Roads, Rural Roads, Urban Roads, and Project Roads. Mitigating Road Accidents: Government Initiatives The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has taken significant steps to tackle the road safety crisis, focusing on education, engineering, and enforcement: Education Measures: To enhance public awareness about road safety, the Ministry conducts awareness campaigns through various media channels, emphasizing the importance of responsible road use. Additionally, a scheme provides financial assistance to agencies involved in Road Safety Advocacy. Engineering Measures: Road safety is now an integral part of road design, with mandatory Road Safety Audits (RSAs) for all highway projects. Notably, the Ministry has made airbags mandatory for the passenger seated next to the driver. Enforcement Measures: The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, brought substantial changes to road safety regulations. It introduced higher penalties for traffic violations, defective vehicles, and other infractions. The Act established a Motor Vehicle Accident Fund, offering compulsory insurance coverage for certain types of accidents. It also paved the way for a National Road Safety Board, to be established by the Central Government. Role of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) plays a vital role in addressing the road safety crisis in India. Many corporations and businesses are recognizing their social responsibility and are actively contributing to road safety initiatives. CSR efforts related to road safety can involve a range of activities, such as funding public awareness campaigns, sponsoring road safety education programs in schools, contributing to the development of safer road infrastructure, and supporting initiatives that provide medical assistance and rehabilitation to accident victims. By engaging in CSR activities centred around road safety, corporations not only contribute to saving lives but also enhance their reputation and build stronger connections with their communities. Furthermore, encouraging businesses to incorporate road safety as a part of their CSR mandate can significantly augment the government’s efforts to make India’s roads safer. It is a joint endeavour where both public and private sectors unite to address this critical issue and work towards a safer and more secure future for all road users. Conclusion The “Road Accidents in India-2022” report serves as a stark reminder of the pressing road safety crisis in the country. The statistics are not mere numbers; they represent lives, families, and communities forever changed by these tragic incidents. The government has undertaken significant measures, but road safety is a collective responsibility that demands the active involvement of citizens, organizations, and communities. Road safety is not just a matter of regulations; it is a matter of life and death. Every life on the road is invaluable, and it is our shared responsibility to make India’s roads safer. As global and national initiatives strive for safer roads, India must intensify its efforts to reduce accidents, save lives, and ensure that every individual embarks on a journey with the expectation of returning safely to their loved ones. Road safety is a concern that transcends government and touches every one of us."

    "article_content": "The pursuit of justice is a fundamental cornerstone of any democratic society. In India, the right to justice is enshrined in the Constitution, ensuring that every citizen has access to legal remedies and protection of their rights. Legal Services Day, observed on November 9th every year, serves as a poignant reminder of the pivotal role that legal services and legal aid play in upholding the principles of justice, equality, and fairness. Legal Services Day marks a significant milestone in India’s pursuit of justice and equity. Its inception in 1995 by the Supreme Court of India was a testament to the nation’s commitment to providing free legal services, not only to reduce the backlog in Indian courts but also to ensure that access to justice is within reach for even the most economically disadvantaged individuals. The overarching goal of Legal Services Day is to extend a helping hand and offer support to the more vulnerable and marginalized segments of the population. This includes women, persons with disabilities, Scheduled Tribes, children, Scheduled Castes, victims of human trafficking, and many others who often find themselves on the fringes of society, struggling to navigate the legal complexities. Legal Services encompass a range of initiatives, including legal aid for those who fall within the purview of Section 12 of the Legal Services Authority Act, 1987. Moreover, it includes fostering legal awareness by disseminating legal education through campaigns, print and digital media, and organizing Lok Adalats for amicable dispute resolution, whether the cases are pending or yet to be filed. Objectives of Legal Services Day 1. Reducing Legal Backlog One of the primary objectives of Legal Services Day is to alleviate the burden on the Indian judicial system. By providing free legal services to those who cannot afford representation, the day aims to expedite the resolution of pending cases, thus contributing to a more efficient legal process. 2. Ensuring Equal Access The day underscores the principle that access to justice is a fundamental right, not a privilege. It strives to ensure that every citizen, regardless of their economic or social status, has equal access to legal remedies and protection of their rights. 3. Empowering Vulnerable Communities Legal Services Day is a beacon of hope for the marginalized and vulnerable segments of society. It is dedicated to providing support to those who often find themselves at a disadvantage when dealing with legal complexities. These segments include women, persons with disabilities, Scheduled Tribes, children, Scheduled Castes, victims of human trafficking, and more. 4. Legal Awareness Legal Services Day promotes legal literacy and awareness among the general population. By disseminating legal education through campaigns, print and digital media, it empowers individuals with knowledge about their rights and the avenues available for seeking legal redress. 5. Alternative Dispute Resolution The day emphasizes the importance of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, such as Lok Adalats. These forums provide a space for amicable dispute resolution, either for pending cases or disputes yet to be filed. By promoting these mechanisms, Legal Services Day aims to reduce the burden on the formal judicial system. A Nationwide Endeavor This nationwide celebration serves as a reminder of the commitment to provide free legal aid to the weaker sections of society and, equally importantly, to empower them with knowledge about their rights. It strives to ensure that no citizen is denied justice because of their economic circumstances. Legal Services Day is not merely a date on the calendar; it is a reflection of the collective will to make justice accessible to all, transcending socio-economic divides and promoting the principles of fairness and equality. Conclusion Legal Services Day is not just a symbolic gesture but a tangible commitment to justice. It highlights the ongoing mission to ensure that every citizen, regardless of their background or circumstances, can exercise their right to justice. This annual celebration renews our pledge to bridge the gap between the legal system and the most vulnerable in society. It is a testament to the enduring spirit of justice and the belief that, indeed, justice delayed is justice denied."

    "article_content": "Researchers working in the area of science & technology often face problems in finding credible sources and scientific publications. This may change soon. The Office of the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India is working on an initiative called ‘One Nation, One Subscription’ to enable researchers to access all accredited publications and journals, without worrying about their credibility. Delivering his keynote address at FICCI’s XROS Fellowship Summit on Tuesday in Delhi, Prof. Ajay Sood, Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India said, “We are trying to put a program in place called One Nation, one subscription. So, we are in dialogue with the publishers and all the heads of consortia which are funding these journals to see how we can take this to a much larger population than what is currently available now. Very difficult job, but we are on it to see if we can make a difference.” Describing Open Source technologies in sync with Indian philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiv Kutumbkam’, he informed the audience, including young XR developers, that his office is working on two more initiatives – one among them is called ICEM, to be housed in Indian Institute of Science, which aims to put together knowledge for the use of all. This project is funded by government agencies and once operationalized, users will be required to pay a nominal fee to access the vast amount of knowledge. The 3 rd project that his team has initiated envisaged open engagement of societal actors, wherein all the knowledge systems in world will have open dialogue on the pressing issues before mankind. XR Open Source (XROS) Fellowship program for Indian developers is one of its kind initiative of the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) with Meta being the Industry partner and during the summit, Graduation Day was organized to felicitate the developers. The program supported 100 developers working on XR technologies by enabling them to contribute to the open-source XR projects in collaboration with leading institutions and companies in XR who were project partners to the program. The program’s journey began with 10,000 registrations, underscoring the eagerness of Indian developers to explore the limitless possibilities offered by XR, and through a rigorous evaluation process, 100 developers were short-listed for contributions to 38 open-source projects listed by 24 partner organizations with the commitment in accelerating India’s contribution in building the XR ecosystem and creating India-specific solutions along the way. Throughout this program, selected developers were provided with a unique platform to exchange ideas, learn, collaborate and work on cutting-edge projects in the XR (extended reality). Over 65 per cent of the developers are from smaller cities and towns across India and about 20 per cent of the selected fellows are women developers. The Fellows worked on open source meta-verse projects across a number of use cases including spatially powered smart wearable devices, 3D atlas of human anatomy helping the medical ecosystem understand the human anatomy in a 3D world, VR accessibility toolkit to aid accessibility for specially-abled individuals in immersive experiences, an Indic meta-verse with heritage site tours and cultural experiences and viable web solutions for AR and VR to enable immersive experiences across a wide variety of hardware form factors. Joining industry stalwarts, Mr Abhishek Singh, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and President and CEO of National E-Governance Division, Government of India said, “ In the evolving open-source ecosystem of XR technology in the various sectors, Initiatives like FICCI XROS Fellowship Program equipped the young tech-savvy Indians with the skills, mentorship, and industry exposure to yield their contribution to our growing technological landscape. It’s not merely a program; it’s the key to unlocking the true potential of Indian developers in XR and meta-verse, fueling their ascent to global prominence. We are glad to be a part of this initiative.” Mr. Ashish Kulkarni, Chair of FICCI AVGC-XR Forum said, “ Empowering Indian developers through the XROS Fellowship Program has been transformative. It’s a gateway for our tech community to lead in XR. The collaboration with Meta and government partners has seeded a vibrant ecosystem, driving innovation in immersive technologies. For FICCI, fostering such programs aligns with our commitment to catalyze technological advancements. Enabling these initiatives promotes India’s tech prowess, aligning with FICCI’s vision to propel our nation as a hub of technological innovation and growth. FICCI has been championing the cause of Animation, VFX, Gaming, Comics &XR” Mr. Shivnath Thukral, Director and Head of Public Policy – India, Meta said , “India will be at the forefront of these emerging technologies and as partners to the country’s digital transformation, we are excited by the enthusiasm of the young developers for our initiative. It is heartening to see the successful implementation of this program and an empowered set of developers who can use these technologies for innovating for India.” The event featured engaging panel discussions around open-source and XR which are critical components of Internet 3.0, how XR technologies’ play a key role in enabling businesses and along with Metaverse showcases by partners and fellows. It also witnessed the participation of distinguished industry leaders, and they appreciated the program’s contribution to the advancement of the open-source ecosystem of XR in India.

    "article_content": "We, as a nation, are on a remarkable path and we will definitely surpass it, said, Shri Sudeep Jain (IAS), Additional Secretary, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India, referring to the 500GW renewable energy target by 2030. He was speaking at the Curtain Raiser of PHDCCI conference on Green Energy Financing & Sustainability: Challenges & Solutions held on March 27 at PHD House, New Delhi. Representatives of industry, government and academia were present on this occasion to deliberate on crucial aspects of green energy financing and sustainability. We do have several challenges, that’s why chambers like PHDCCI are required to bring on the table the issues and create awareness in industry, Mr. Jain emphasized. As individuals, we need to conserve energy; it is the best investment without any subsidy. He also apprised about the PM Surya Ghar program and emphasized the critical role of financing mechanisms in driving sustainable initiatives in the renewable energy sector. He further added, 2023 marked the hottest year yet, surpassing the crucial 1.5-degree Celsius target that the global community strives to maintain. It’s evident that unless we collectively recognize climate change as a paramount challenge, finding solutions and working towards mitigation will remain elusive. India’s ambitious goals underscore the urgency of addressing this pressing issue head-on. Mr. Shachindra Nath, Chair, BFSI Committee, PHDCCI, said that the gap between capital providers and consumers is evident across industries. Bridging this divide required a sustained dialogue, where financing institutions see sustainability not just as a mandate but as an attractive opportunity. Through continuous learning and collaborative efforts, they aim to formulate solutions that resonate with industry leaders and drive meaningful change. Mr. Sanjeev Gupta, Co-Chair, BFSI Committee, PHDCCI, emphasized the need for more efficient technology to be catalyzed. He added, as we succeed, new challenges arise in familiar or new areas. Land, evacuation, and storage are on-going major issues, with land being particularly important. Even a top corporate entity in our country faces these challenges. We need to identify these issues not to criticize but to find practical solutions. While not every solution works everywhere, each can offer benefits suited to different situations. Dr. Ranjeet Mehta, Executive Director, PHDCCI, said, the green energy transition is extremely important. The initial cost of such a transition is very high. Addressing carbon emissions is crucial in our journey towards sustainability. Energy transition plays a pivotal role in this endeavor, making sustainability a success. Therefore, there is a need for green financing. However, there are certain challenges; hence plans can be formed to achieve 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030. Ms. Surbhi Goyal, Senior energy Specialist, World Bank shared that the World Bank comes and takes the first mover risk. Tariff distribution companies are important, and their participation is also crucial to strike a balance between renewable energy and fossil fuel energy. As in states that are fossil fuel dominators, bringing them into the fold of renewable energy is essential. Also, policy and regulation systems across the country can be improved through standardization. Dr. R K Singh, Chief General Manager, SIDBI outlined the dual role of development financial institutions: the market maker role and the circuit breaker role. He added, in our green financing agenda our focus was to simplify processes, eliminate biases, and enhance the capacity of our value chain to transform the entire ecosystem. He further discussed the Udhyam Sangyan initiative of SIDBI for MSMEs, aiming to enhance their capabilities and open new horizons for growth. Mr. B N Mishra, Senior Advisor, IBA, discussed the significant resources in the banking sector, stating that the banking sector has 138 players and 116,000 branches with around 200 trillion deposits as resources. He further elaborated on capacity building, and said IBA works closely with RBI, Ministry of Finance, and MNRE. There are many standing committees, and every bank now has an ESG vertical. This time can be called the Green Revolution Part 2, hence It’s imperative to recognize the collaborative effort, where stakeholders across sectors come together to drive meaningful change. Mr. Joshit Ranjan Sikidar, Director (Finance), SECI; Dr. Manish Karna, Head- Business Development, Adani Greens; Mr. Rahul Dubey, Investment Director, IFU; , among others, the esteemed participants deliberated on their areas of specialization in green energy financing and sustainability. Their contributions added valuable perspectives to the discussions, further enriching the dialogue on sustainable advocacy. The event overall set the stage for comprehensive dialogue and collaborative efforts towards achieving India’s renewable energy goals.

    "article_content": "The education department of Government of Maharashtra has announced that pre-primary and primary classes in schools will commence no earlier than 9 AM from academic year 2024-25. A Government Resolution (GR) was issued on Thursday, June 13, directing the schools to start classes for pre-primary students till class 4 at or after 9 AM, irrespective of their board affiliation. The decision has been made taking into account the changing lifestyles wherein children end up sleeping late at night, and get insufficient sleep if they are forced to come to school early in the morning. This compromises their physical and mental health, and also stunts their overall growth. Several studies have also shown decreased cognitive function and concentration among children who do not get sufficient sleep. Another benefit of later school is for the parents who struggle with transportation early in the morning during foggy or rainy days. Later school will help them manage their timings much better. Parents, Experts Concerned with new changes However, there are several matters of concern. Critics have stated that this decision will push the school timings of post primary students later during the day, who will end up being busy with school till evening leaving them no time for pursuing hobbies or extra curricular activities, as their evenings would then be spent in completing the homework or self-study. Some parents have also expressed their concerns as the schools their children go to are close to their home, requiring minimal commute, but they commute for more than an hour for their workplace. Their office hours commence from 9 AM and the new school timings mean that they have to leave for office earlier than their children have to leave for school. The abrupt announcement has them scrambling for making new arrangements at such a short notice. Furthermore, considering the fact that the hours of operation for most of the offices start at 9 AM, roads at this time are already busy. With school traffic joining the office going traffic, this could add to the traffic congestion issues in big cities causing loss of resources and time. Some experts have said that the new schedule can prove counterproductive and even harmful for several children especially in the regions with extreme weather conditions, as it could expose children to harsh midday heat. This is a problem especially because majority of schools in India are not equipped with air conditioners or coolers. While the decision is made in a positive light, the change in schedule can have major implications in the life of children and their families. It is imperative that the education department work with schools, parents, teachers and all the other stakeholders to maximise the efficiency in education."

    "article_content": "In the face of a rapidly warming planet, RPG Foundation’s biodiversity project nature:re is taking small steps to rebalance our planet. Under nature:recity, we are bringing in a game-changing approach of a Green Corridor to develop biodiversity in the urban landscapes of Mumbai. Kickstarting this initiative, we are transforming the parks of Shantivan in Malabar Hills and Captain Namdev Lotankar Garden in Mahalaxmi. The redesigned parks will function as ecologically-driven urban oasis, incorporating native plantations, soil and water-conserving landscaping principles. The strategic selection of Rora will enhance habitat connectivity and promote local pollinator population, building a more robust ecosystem. By sequestering carbon-dioxide through photosynthesis, the redesigned parks will function as vital urban carbon sinks. Additionally, the native plants will contribute to urban heat island mitigation, lowering ambient temperatures through evapotranspiration, a natural cooling process. The enriched biodiversity will not only enhance the ecological balance but also serve as a valuable resource for environmental education and scientific research in the city. Before: After: 60% of the world’s population will live in cities by 2030, causing intense pressure on urban green spaces. Green cover across cities is rapidly decreasing. India recorded thehighest temperature th is year – 52.3 degrees celsius in 2024, surpassing the previous record of 49.2 degrees celsius set in 2002. These redesigned parks offer a much-needed respite for Mumbaikars. Educational trails, informative signage, and designated seating areas will allow visitors to connect withnature in a meaningful way, fostering a deeper appreciation for the environment. Captain Namdev Lotankar Garden – Botanical Treasure Trove: It boasts 49 recorded tree species, with 24 native varieties. – Heritage Trees: It houses 11 grand old trees, including 10 Raintrees and a Banyan, all classi1ed as heritage trees. – Diverse Flora: The park showcases a variety of native and non-native trees like Kuchala, Java Olive, Mahogany, Rose Apple, and Ankol. – Rich Fauna: A survey identi1ed 40 fauna species, including 14 butterRy species, birds like the Alexandrine Parakeet, and mammals like the Five-striped PalmSquirrel. Shantivan Park – Hidden Oasis: Features enchanting moss-covered paths and repurposed steps transformed into arti1cial streams and mini waterfalls, creating a charming escape. – Biodiversity Hotspot: Boasts over 8G plant species and 50+ fauna species, showcasing a vibrant ecosystem within the city. Starting with Mumbai, the project establishes a network of interconnected public parks and open spaces, stretching from the city’s northern tip to its southern end. Thisnetwork will provide suitable habitats, ensuring the seamless movement of Rora and fauna, ultimately promoting a resilient ecosystem with the long-term survival of diversenative species. 2021-2030 is the UN decade for preventing, halting, and reversing the loss of nature. RPG Foundation’s nature:re is at the forefront of creating a more sustainable future. By harnessing the power of nature, we can combat rising temperatures, protectbiodiversity, and create vibrant public spaces for all to enjoy. Disclaimer: This media release is auto-generated.

    "published_date": "2024-06-07T12:09:51+00:00",
    "author_name": "Hency Thacker",
    "author_url": "https://thecsrjournal.in/author/hency-thacker/",
    "article_content": "According a recent ruling of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) in Mumbai, the companies are entitled to claim tax deductions for expenses incurred related to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act. This reverses the earlier claims of the tax authorities that did not accept tax deductions for CSR spending. Background and Ruling The case that triggered the ruling by ITAT involved a company in the aluminum composite panel sheet industry, that had included CSR-related donations in its tax return, seeking deductions under Section 80G. However, the tax authorities declined half of these claims presenting an argument that CSR expenditure is mandated by law, and since it is not voluntary, it does not qualify as donations for tax deductions. In order to challenge this claim, the company appealed to the first appellate authority who stood with the tax authorities on the matter. The company then appealed further which brought the case to the ITAT. The ITAT with Judicial Member Kavitha Rajagopal and Accountant Member Om Prakash Kant on the bench, reversed the previous order of the appellate authority, ruling in favour of the company. The order issued by the bench has noted that an amendment in 2015 to Section 80G, which added specific exclusions for certain CSR donations (such as those to the Swachh Bharat Kosh and Clean Ganga Fund), indicates that other CSR-related expenses can still qualify for deductions under Section 80G. This interpretation comes as a relief to companies as it allows them to claim deductions for a broader range of CSR activities. Implications The ruling has broader implications, when it comes to undertaking CSR beyond law. The aim of mandating CSR was not to stronghold companies into handing out more money to the government who is originally in charge of the social development. It is to encourage participation of the corporates in the development, while reminding them of their responsibility towards the society. The underlining aim is to get corporates to view CSR as opportunity to collaborate with various entities for development of the society at large, rather than focusing solely on profits while paying away an amount as tax for operating within a community and utilising its resources. To get corporates to develop this attitude is challenging if they are taxed for the CSR expenditures they make. This ruling helps address this road-block, and it further incentivises companies to conduct more CSR initiatives rather than making donations without further monitoring. Additionally, by allowing deductions for CSR related donations or expenses, the ruling reinforces the purpose of Section 80G, which aims to encourage philanthropy and support charitable organisations. This can lead to increase in funding for social, cultural, economic development and environment conservation initiatives. The ITAT’s decision has confirmed that expenses made under CSR of a company, can still be considered donations for tax purposes, even if they are legally required, provided they meet specific criteria. By allowing deductions for CSR-related donations under Section 80G, the ruling not only supports and encourages corporate philanthropy but also provides much-needed clarity for businesses to continue investing in social and environmental initiatives beyond what is required by the law."

    "article_content": "Burning to ashes is the hope that Meitei, Kuki, and Naga society members will coexist after eradicating past resentments. Mutual trust has deteriorated, and there is a great deal of despondency. At the moment, Manipur is separated into two parts. The Meitei people are in one portion, and the Kuki people are in the other. The type of violent scene that is being witnessed is not one or two days’ worth, but rather one that has been going on for weeks and resulted in the destruction of communities, homes and people. Given the kind of flaws that are now apparent, it appears that this crack has existed for a very long period. Since independence, the Kuki community, who follow Christianity, have got the status of Scheduled Tribe. Some people belonging to the dominant Meitei Hindu community did not get reservation while some became Scheduled Caste and some got OBC status. This is the reason for the quarrel, because Meitei people cannot buy land in Kuki areas and now they also want tribal status. Obviously, the issue is of rights on the land. The majority of the population of 2.8 million have lived in the Meitei Valley, while the Kuki population is settled in four hill districts. In this ongoing violence, the people of both the communities settled at each other’s place have become victims. By the way, there are Meitei Muslims and Nagas in the state who remain untouched by this violence. The distinctive feature is that, for the first time in Manipur’s history, sacred sites are now the target of caste-based violence. Both the temple and the church are being set on fire, especially the temple that the Meitei community uses for worship and the church where the Kuki people offer prayers . Every time something is written about an incident which humiliates humanity and devastates the so-called civilised society, the opening phrase is always, “The country is boiling,” but this time, even this line is unable to capture the rage of the mind. Screams are dying in the throat, and the veins are burying the blood boil. I had never witnessed such a rigged political system, and this was beyond anything I could have imagined. The people are being used as pawns for the game of power in the politics of rumour by sowing the seeds of animosity. In order to make the nation a global guru and its leaders politicians, people are being sacrificed, as is the right to life. Either dead or mute are the people. There was a rumour going around that members of the Kuki community had murdered a woman from the Meitei community. Despite the fact that no proof of the incident’s veracity could be uncovered, this rumour ignited clashes among different ethnic groups in Manipur. The Meitei and Kuki community riots in Manipur took a nasty turn as a result of the rumour, which was a political manoeuvre. Two Kuki community members were forcibly stripped off their clothing and displayed in front of thousands of people while completely naked. On social media, the terrible footage of gang rape in broad daylight and public indecency with her naked body went viral. The incident occurred between May 3 and 4. Delhi-based kuki women condemned this dishonourable event. The matter was also brought up in the media, but only after two months, when the entire nation came to know about it through social media, that authorities are waking up and action is being taken. There will also likely be some political issues involved with this. Why would it occur to someone to strip a woman in a country where women are valued for their strength? Have you ever heard of a man being compelled to disrobe in public due to social or interpersonal hostility? No. So why was a woman’s body employed as a means of exacting retribution against a particular class? Why has one social class utilised a woman’s body as a tool for social change? We are dead if we do not feel the hands of the crazed mob scurrying over the nude body of the naked woman drowning her screams on the road! If we do not confront the mindset that enjoyed playing with our women’s naked bodies and dignity, we should perish! Despite witnessing the vulnerable women being raped in front of their deceased father and sibling, if we are able to sleep soundly, we are actually dead. This civilization is dead because we remain mute despite the political chessboard being laid out on the injured, naked bodies of women! The central government has not felt the need to intervene despite the fact that Manipur has been experiencing violence for the past three months. Although there were daily reports of violence, murder, and theft of people and money, the authorities did little right away. We were too preoccupied with building our reputation abroad and flagging off new initiatives instead of paying attention to our internal issues. The era of political rhetoric has just begun. We read the news, vent our wrath mostly on social media, and then we quickly forget. But will the Kuki women ever be able to forget this terrible incident? Will these incidents never occur again? The Manipur incident is also a recurrence. Repetition of the practice of using women’s dignity to exact revenge on one another! Be it Draupadi’s shredding, the gang rape of women in Kashmir’s holocaust, or the Manipur tragedy – all are methods of exacting retribution against society or a certain class, every time a woman’s pride, her body was exploited. And this is the state of a society, where Yatra Nari Pujyante, Ramante Tatra Devta has been acknowledged for millennia. The fire in Manipur is still not extinguished. The leaders are yet to visit Manipur. VVIPs and media teams are yet to reach the houses of the victims. Bale of assurances are yet to be tied. Statements are left to ‘shout’ for the ‘daughters of the country’ from those who were silent till now, who did not even consider it necessary to make an appeal for peace to the people of Manipur! There was never any riot in the name of religion in Manipur. The reality is that after such a long period of violence, the scene is even more frightening. “Whether it is the Centre or the state government, no one has taken care of them properly.” The period of this violence started with the demand for rights and then it shifted to religion. Mutual trust has ended among those who have been living together as a community for hundreds of years. However, in the midst of the tragic inhuman incident in Manipur, there is good news! The US intelligence agency CIA Chief William J. Burns has said that the danger of nuclear war has been averted due to a very simple advice of our own honourable Indian Prime Minister Shri. Narendra Modi to the Russian President Vladimir Putin ‘No war era’ . With this statement coming from the American CIA chief, the image of India at the international level has further improved and a nuclear war has been averted."

    "article_content": "This is Ram Naam politics. Politics in Ayodhya has taken several forms since the country’s independence. While Ayodhya, the city of Shri Ram, should have become independent with the independence of the country, it had to wait for several decades for its liberation! That too when Shri Ram is not just a name but a symbol of faith for crores of people. The Supreme Court’s ruling has put an end to the legal tussle that had been raging for the previous 100 years, but will the politics of votes in the name of Shri Ram end with the construction of the temple? This question arises from the Ram Janmabhoomi Ayodhya conflict, which has distorted the nation’s politics the most over the last several decades. Ayodhya, which has been at the centre of politics for centuries, is once again at the centre of things. Era changed, time changed, circumstances changed and now the geography of Ayodhya is also changing. The construction work of the temple is in full swing. Today, the city of Ayodhya has become such a centre where it has become mandatory for every leader to cross the waters of political bridge by donning the robe of Hindutva and taking a dip in the flowing Ganga in the name of Shri Ram. Ayodhya has emerged as the gateway to the political corridor, where personalities and groups that had previously shied away from Hindutva and Ram naam are now seen bowing down. The two most important topics in state politics are caste and religion. Politicians feel that if they can “break through caste and unite through religion,” they would be able to get the most votes, and the public is constantly the victim of their political scheming. Here, too, the political lion has always eaten the bread by stirring common people against one another, under the guise of Shri Ram or Rahim, according to the situation. Ram naam has a long political history. With the support of the Congress, Baba Raghav Das ran for office in 1948 on the platform of Ram Janma bhoomi’s emancipation. This call for Hindutva and upliftment of Ayodhya was successful and as soon as Baba Raghav Das won the election, on the night of 23 December 1948, he opened the lock of the disputed premises, installed the idol of Ramlala and started to worship-kirtan. This marked the beginning of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and the Indian political revival in the recently sovereign nation! And the power of this movement was felt for the first time by Atal Bihari Vajpayee during the elections. He discovered that opposing Shri Ram, who had a strong hold over the minds, hearts, and souls of the populace, made politics extremely challenging. The nation cannot experience a spiritual or cultural revival without Shri Ram. Following this, the Ram Janmabhoomi movement acquired a political hue, while politics is still deeply ingrained in it, going beyond its initial religious, spiritual, and cultural roots. Politicians continued to pursue their plans and the common people continued to suffer. Following the Babri Masjid’s demolition in December 1992, the Ram janma bhoomi controversy became a political platform for blatantly discriminatory Hindu-Muslim policies. The general public continued to suffer as political parties carried out their schemes and plans. Who knows how many lives were lost in this political game of religion, the sting of which is still raw and fresh in the hearts of the people. The demolition of Babri Masjid was not in any way related to religion or faith in the name of Shri Ram, rather it was just a golden opportunity to take the wave of Hindutva to its peak for political gain and governments capitalized on this opportunity from time to time. In any case, it has long been an Indian custom to unearth corpses during election celebrations in order to discredit the other political parties. The building of the Ram temple gained prominence throughout the years as one of the key election-related promises, and it consistently worked to sway voters and the broader public. This time, too, the issue will prove to be a sure fire “panacea” for a specific party, as on the auspicious day of January 22, 2024, Ram Lalla will finally take his rightful place in the temple. Following its independence, India developed in all spheres in line with the times, whether they were social, economic, geographic, or educational. Of course, in a democratic setting, politics also advanced, but it began to prioritise individual interests over those of the country. Numerous new groups emerged, and these groups grew daily like mushrooms. It was crucial to understand how weak humanity was if they were to continue to live and preserve their control. What possible shortcoming could there be in a religious nation like India than religion and faith? All political parties united with all religions, and the inevitable result occurred. People who were striving for advancement were progressively drawn into the political maze in the guise of religion, which caused them to become more and more fragmented and provided all the parties with an opening to exploit these dispersed fragments. Politics in the name of Hanuman and Shri Ram has begun to gather steam from North to South. The Government of Telangana has set aside Rs 600 crore for the reconstruction of an extremely old Hanuman Temple. The last steps of preparations are underway for the reconstruction of Gujarat’s Dwarka. Building the Shri Ram Temple and developing Ayodhya have never been simple endeavours. All avenues of progress have been blocked by caste and religion. It was never viewed solely through the eyes of “Ram” and his “Ayodhya.” He has consistently served as the conduit for the growth of parties. In particular, Uttar Pradesh politics has traditionally prospered under the shadow of Shri Ram. It’s possible that some who recite Ram’s name have never comprehended his principles, dignity, and ideals. Since Shri Ram was the monarch of the common people, if they had understood, the conflict between the mosque and the temple would not have arisen. Even the general public was ignorant of their Ram! Ram Lalla will at last be able to live in his Ayodhya with dignity from January 2024. It is almost time for Ayodhya to return to Ramyug. Elections are quickly approaching, political fervour is growing daily, and the cry “Jai Shri Ram” is resonating not just nationally but globally as well. ‘Those who brought Shri Ram’ are growing in prominence and actively compared to ‘Ram’. The general people are supporting Ram in their cheers. The roti’s are ready, the pan is hot, and the dishes are garnished. I’m eager to try the hot roti’s right now."

    "article_content": "More than one million adults lose their lives every year in India because of tobacco use, according to National Institute of Health. This accounts for about 9.5 per cent of total deaths in the country each year. India faces a dual burden when it comes to tobacco usage – in form of smoking tobacco and non-smoking tobacco. As of 2020, about 28.6 per cent of total adults in the country use tobacco in some form. In order to raise awareness about the harmful effects of tobacco use and encourage campaigns aimed at discouraging tobacco use, May 31st is observed as Anti-Tobacco Day across the globe. Ban on Advertising of Tobacco Products Considering the harmful effects of tobacco, the World Health Organisation launched a global anti-tobacco movement under which it adopted WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in 2003. One of the key provisions of FCTC is ban on all forms of advertising of tobacco products. About 180 countries have ratified FCTC including India, making advertising or promoting use of tobacco products illegal in the country. However, the tobacco selling companies have found a loophole around this, giving birth to Surrogate Advertising. What is Surrogate Advertising? Were you watching the recently concluded IPL? If you were, then you were subjected to Surrogate Advertising of Kamala Pasand. There were several ads featuring various popular cricketers including Kapil Dev, Virender Sehwag, Chris Gayle, and Sunil Gavaskar among others promoting Kamala Pasand Pan Masala or Kamala Pasand Elaichi. Surrogate Advertising is basically advertising by brands selling products like alcohol or tobacco, with an aim to keep the brand name in public eye and maintain brand loyalty without directly advertising harmful products. The Role of Celebrities in Surrogate Advertising The role of celebrities is very crucial for effective surrogate advertising. When popular faces like bollywood stars and famous sports persons endorse these brands, the public find them more appealing. This is why brands like Rajnigandha and Vimal have roped in popular celebrities like Ajay Devgan, Tiger Shroff and even Anushka Sharma and Priyanka Chopra who have landed their faces to several philanthropic causes and are otherwise known for their altruistic responsibility. The involvement of celebrities in surrogate advertising raises significant ethical questions. Celebrities have a powerful influence on public behavior and attitudes, and their endorsements can significantly impact consumer choices. When they lend their names and faces to brands associated with tobacco products, even indirectly, they contribute to the normalization and acceptance of these harmful products. There is a growing call for celebrities to exercise greater social responsibility and consider the broader impact of their endorsements. Given the well-documented health risks associated with tobacco use, promoting brands linked to tobacco, even through surrogate products, can be seen as endorsing these risks. Celebrities are in a unique position to influence public perceptions and behaviors, and they should leverage this influence to promote positive, healthy choices. While the ban on direct tobacco advertising is a significant step forward, the persistence of surrogate advertising indicates a need for stricter regulations. Governments and regulatory bodies must close the loopholes that allow tobacco companies to bypass advertising bans through surrogate products. This could involve: 1. Broadening the Scope of Bans: Expanding the definition of tobacco advertising to include any products that share branding with tobacco products. 2. Celebrity Accountability: Implementing guidelines and penalties for celebrities who endorse brands associated with harmful products. 3. Public Awareness Campaigns: Increasing public awareness about the tactics used by tobacco companies and the health risks associated with tobacco use. Anti-Tobacco Day serves as a crucial reminder of the ongoing battle against tobacco use and the need for continued vigilance and innovation in tobacco control strategies The fight against tobacco is far from over, and it requires the collective efforts of governments, public health organizations, and individuals, including those in the public eye. By understanding the tactics used by the tobacco industry and advocating for stronger regulations, we can work towards a future where tobacco use is significantly reduced, and public health is prioritised."

It is responding to needs with the support of dry ration, safe drinking water, Covid care essentials and other necessary items of home utility. While millions of affected families are seeking shelters to stay safe from the aftermath of the catastrophic cyclone, risk of spreading coronavirus pandemic is looming large. Maintaining social distance in rescue and relief efforts has become a challenge at this time. Basis the first level need-assessment by the team, SEEDS appeals for support towards providing immediate relief and building back better with Odisha and West Bengal through its Cyclone Yaas response in times of COVID-19. This disaster comes amid the ongoing crisis of Covid-19 that has only raised the concerns and challenges for the most marginalised communities having to face the brunt. At this moment, the organisation with its local partners and a total of 400 volunteers are actively reaching out to the local communities at the ground. Says Dr Manu Gupta, Co-founder, SEEDS, “We at SEEDS remain committed and are actively reaching out to maximum number of people and our teams are working relentlessly to analyse the long-term needs of the affected. We are also gauging how the affected families can be helped most effectively while maintaining measures to strengthen the struggle against the spread of the ongoing pandemic. As we begin to reach out to the most vulnerable communities to address their immediate needs, we appeal for maximum support from corporates, institutions and citizens.” SEEDS calls for funding for the following: Ration Kit: Rs. 1,000 to support one family of 5 consisting of a wheat flour, rice, pulses, oil, spices, salt, soybean, sugar, tea leaf and milk powder Safe Drinking Water Support: Rs. 1,000 to support one family with safe water for a month Covid Care Kit: Rs. 1,500 to support one family with face masks, toothbrushes, toothpaste, towel, sanitary pads, nail cutter, mosquito repellent, washing soap, bathing soap, washing powder, buckets, mug Family Utility Kit: Rs. 4,000 to support one family with plates, glasses, bowls, kadai, spoons, lighter; and bedding items like double size floor mat, bed sheet, mosquito net and solar lamp with USB charger.

The intention is to use the power of expressive arts to bring positive change and transformation in communities. Since then the organisation based in Maharashtra has focused its work with the incarcerated population, rescued women, children in conflict with law, senior citizens, children in the community and corporates. Recently a project was undertaken by KA in collaboration with Kshamata and UNICEF, to provide psycho-social support during the Covid-19 pandemic. During the three months starting from October, Khula Aasman Trust covered 43 different institutions in Maharashtra reaching out to as many as 2,350 women and children in shelter homes, observation homes and rescue homes through 100 sessions. The facilitators for the sessions were Sarita Ganesh and Tanvi Oswal. Says Sarita, “The entire experience was touching, sometimes overwhelming as we discovered how much the lockdown had affected the lives of the people in closed walls of institutions. Not leaving the shelter home for 2 years, and having no connection with the outside world seems like imprisonment? Yes, very close to that. Conflicts occur, boredom, stress, fear are easily felt. Anger seemed to be the major driving emotion for many of them.” In the process of the sessions, they asked the participants to depict their emotions, whether at the surface or deeper and their dreams/desires. It gave an insight into their world – the need for family – especially the love for their mothers. The drawings of many of the boys in observation homes showed the impact of broken families they came from. The fathers would often be missing or depicted in hate. Adds Sarita, “The sessions offered a space to release these pent-up emotions and feelings, to share them, to bring happiness through games, movement and art and finally to understand how to cope with negative emotions and thoughts and how to transform them.”"

    "article_content": "COP Initiative aka Certified Ophthalmic Paramedics Initiative was launched by Dr Shroff’s Charity Eye Hospital (SCEH) in 2014. It is a program to train young women who belong to marginalized societies to become technically sound, learn life skills for holistic development so that they can navigate their life pressure. They are the ones who do not get adequate opportunities. It is said, “When you educate a man, you educate an individual; when you educate a woman, you educate a country.” The COP initiative at SCEH is entitled to not only create empowered and efficient skilled allied ophthalmic employees but also to foster a safe and productive work environment for these young girls. By supporting young women to stay in the training school for two years, SCEH indirectly contribute towards the prevention of early marriage and childbearing. The program serves the need to bring in gender equality through employability. The trained paramedics have enhanced knowledge about eye care; have computer proficiency and counseling skills, which gives them respect in the society and power to stand on their own feet. Aim of the Project The COP initiative is aimed at creating an empowered cadre of trained allied ophthalmic personnel for strengthening the Ophthalmic services delivery system. SCEH has the vision to be a centre of excellence in allied ophthalmic training and consultancy by filling the gap in Human Resources by offering society equipped, efficient, and an empowered cadre of allied ophthalmic paramedics who never look back. How the Project Works? Under the program, young women from the lower strata across all the SCEH Centers are selected as beneficiaries. By taking the students from across all the centres, SCEH is trying to meet the deficit of skilled manpower and thereby strengthening the centres. An aptitude test is developed that is administered on students. A special emphasis is laid on one-to-one discussions with candidates and their parents. The preference is given to the underprivileged section of society for the lack of career opportunities. The two-year Certified Ophthalmic Paramedics (COP) program or AOP program has gone from strength to strength, building from an indigenous home-grown training program to a nationally accepted standard program with a good reputation in the eye care circle. It is certified by Health Sector Skill Council. Fully supported by the management, it has a dedicated infrastructure, well-structured and executed curriculum, expert faculty, foolproof assessment techniques, and a student-friendly environment. Impact of the project Dr Shroff’s Charity Eye Hospital, to meet the deficit of skilled Allied Ophthalmic Paramedics (AOPs), has enrolled more than 700 cadres of women from the bottom of the pyramid, to capacitate them to function as ophthalmic assistants since 2014 with a significant focus on their holistic development and women empowerment. Through this, the volume of patients seen and operated by the hospital has doubled. It is operating more than 40,000 patients in a year and screening around 500,000 people in a year with more than 50% of its paramedical human resources being contributed by this course. Aid the Project The project is a major success, and to scale it further, it requires support from the public in the following ways: Connecting the organisation with prospective students that would benefit from the course, Supporting the organisation by meeting the infrastructure requirements for the course.

    "article_content": "TNS India Foundation has developed a Campus to Corporate Careers Program, which aims to usher under-resourced college-going youth into the formal workforce. The program works on up-skilling the youth in 21st-century advanced technical, digital, and industrial skills, thereby unlocking their economic potential. The Project is aimed at empowering under-resourced young Indians, enabling them to reach their economic potential and pull their families out of poverty. The organisation believes that if the job readiness of youth is strengthened by – – Enhancing their digital/technical and 21st-century skills, – Developing student orientation toward corporate careers, – Supporting youth in entering and remaining in high-potential corporate careers, then disadvantaged youth will substantially increase their family incomes, lifting them out of poverty within three to five years. The project, initiated in 2015, diversifies into three learning pathways: Campus to Digital Careers (C2DC) program, Campus to Technical Careers (C2TC) program and Campus to Industrial Careers (C2IC) program. 1. Campus to Digital Careers (C2DC) program: Upskilling disadvantaged youth from non-technical streams (B.Sc, MSc, B.com, BMS, BBA, BBI, BAF, BAFI) to build careers in the BFSI/BPO/KPO/Support service sectors. 2. Campus to Technical Careers (C2TC) program: Upskilling disadvantaged youth from technical streams (B.Sc, B. Tech, Mathematics, BE, MCA) to build technical careers in the IT/ITeS sector. 3. Campus to Industrial Careers (C2IC) program: Upskilling NEET (not in education, employment or training) individuals enrolled in ITIs (trades like COPA, stenography, sewing etc.) to build industrial careers. Each of these learning pathways include the three key components: 1. Career Readiness – Strengthening the job readiness of youth by enhancing digital skills/advanced technical skills and 21st century skills – TNSIF’s ‘Career Bridge’ is a blended activity-based (online and offline) training program which equips college students with 21st-century life skills, including digital literacy, advanced technical skills, financial literacy, job readiness and aptitude training. 2. Career Counselling – Developing student orientation towards corporate careers through career counselling – Participating youth undergo employability baseline assessment tests to map their current skills, workplace competencies and personality traits. – Assessment results provide them with a detailed analysis of their job readiness and enable a more targeted job search. – The program provides all students with one-on-one career counselling, helping them make appropriate career choices and cope effectively with personal and professional pressures. 3. Career Access – Supporting youth to enter high-potential corporate careers – Career Fests and company-specific placement drives are organised for large-scale placements at college campuses. These large-scale events, modelled on top-tier business schools, give students the opportunity to interview with their top five best-fit companies. – The program has established partnerships with over 100+ reputed corporates, which typically attend these Career Fests, and has successfully placed the trained youth in a variety of roles. – Over 80% of the youth placed through the program have cited C2C’s training and support as key factors in securing a job. – Each student is provided with 4 interview opportunities for placement and follow-up support and guidance after program completion. This Campus to Corporate program has been implemented across 7 states in cities: Mumbai, Delhi, Noida, Bangalore, Puducherry, Chennai, Nashik, and Akola. The beneficiaries of the program are young people, generally children of migrant labourers or daily wage workers. As these families depend on daily wages, small-scale businesses, and informal employment to meet basic needs, they are at the mercy of income uncertainties and have been among the most severely impacted by the pandemic. Impact of the program The program has achieved the following milestones: – C2C program has been able to build partnerships with 70+ corporations for beneficiary recruitment. – C2C program has partnered with over 120 colleges to conduct beneficiary training. – Trained approximately 24,000 students since 2015. – This program has an approximately 70% female participation rate.

    "article_content": "Mumbai-based Ajay is raising INR 50 lakh via ImpactGuru.com for his wife Reshma, who is suffering from a rare autoimmune disorder called Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), also known as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The disorder has wrecked 32-year-old Reshma’s health for the last two years. Reshma’s body movements are restricted due to this rare disorder, leading to quadriparesis (muscle weakness in all four limbs- both legs and arms. Previously, she had experienced cardiac arrest as a result of this adverse condition and was admitted to the hospital for a duration of more than four months. Further diagnosis hinted at a rare auto immune disorder. Due to the exorbitant expenses involved, her family was unable to afford the costs and had to arrange for the setup at home instead, incurring monthly expenses of around INR 2.5 to 3 lakhs. At present, she relies on a ventilator, unable to move or consume food, necessitating the use of feeding tubes. Currently, doctors have advised physiotherapy for her. Reshma undergoes different physical and mental exercises such as writing and coloring as part of her physiotherapy. So far, Ajay has taken exorbitant personal loans, more than 80 lakhs for Reshma’s treatment. Friends and family have contributed more than 60 lakhs. Having exhausted all financing options, Ajay has now pinned his hopes to the generosity of the donors via medical crowdfunding. He requires an additional INR 50 lakh to continue her treatment without any hindrance. Being a positive person that she is, Reshma hasn’t given up on her health and is hopeful of her recovery. She indulges herself in reading various books everyday and carries on her passion for cooking and baking through her social media channels. “After creating some beautiful memories with Reshma in our first two years of marriage, everything has unexpectedly taken a drastic turn in our lives. Despite all of this, my only prayer is to continue building a wonderful marriage with her. Please help me in ensuring that Reshma undergoes timely treatment,” says Ajay. We are asking for each one of you to help in spreading the word about this campaign and supporting Ajay in raising funds for the treatment of his wife.

    "article_content": "As World NGO Day quietly concluded yesterday, without much celebration, commemoration or discussion, it was evidently clear that the development sector doesn’t talk much about itself or the impact it creates on society. This also reflected in the fact that other significant stakeholders did not mark this day in any way. It wouldn’t hurt to remind ourselves once a year, that during the pandemic, India was immensely dependent on them to recover. It is safe to say that they were the only ones who put people before everything during this crisis. They understand communities and grassroots issues like no other. This sentiment is echoed by India Inc., philanthropists, government and media. Recognition and appreciation to this sector is long overdue in the public discourse. And like any other sector, the onus lies on non-profits, civil society and volunteer organizations to take reputation management and stakeholder expectations seriously; especially in a highly conflicted world. Reputation management in the non-profit sector appears to be at an inflection point in its development. Not so long ago, we believed that it was immune to criticism. But the recent spate of crises it has seen, proves otherwise. Few things can be as fatal for a non-profit as loss of reputation. There are large, established organizations who understand that it can make or break the cause they have been working on since years. They have experienced first hand that they bounce back faster after a crisis, because they diligently invested in reputation management. On the other hand, are mid and small scale organizations, that must understand that reputation begets trust. It brings greater credibility to a program faster, acts as an enabler for people to sit up and take notice, drives donor decisions, helps attract and retain talent, gets passionate volunteers and supports equity building with government. For example, would child rights in India get the same attention and action, had leading social reformer and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, Kailash Satyarthi, not continued to maintain the momentum of conversations around child rights issues? The answer is no. Nor would have the issue of girl child education, had Anand Mahindra not chosen to speak about the issue at various forums and ensured the foundation got its due credit for implementing one of India’s most credible flagship program in grassroots India. We spoke to 20+ NGOs (small, mid and large scale) to understand what reputation management meant to them. Highlighting human interest stories that tugged at our heartstrings, translating complex research outcomes into easy to understand content, multi-stakeholder engagement with special attention on decision makers, leveraging new age technology in communication, responding faster and more thoughtfully during crisis, were some of their top priorities. Building and managing reputation is a science with many nuances. But there are some simple tenets that non-profits can adopt to ensure they enjoy the trust of their stakeholders. Emphasise localness. Be proud of your small scale; if you are a small NGO, let people know. Build awareness; name recognition is key. More they hear about you, deeper the trust. Focus on your target key audiences; this will help you customize your messaging for them. Be transparent in your communication; tell your stakeholders about your spending and the impact you crate through it. Value the trust your stakeholders put in you and always be prepared to respond to an internal or external crisis. And lastly, keep taking feedback and mapping perception. It is always better to hear first-hand, what can be improved, than from a donor, volunteer or partner. So, should non-profits invest in reputation management? The answer will always be yes."

    "article_content": "India, poised on the cusp of economic transformation, faces a critical challenge: its burgeoning youth population is entering the workforce at a pace that far exceeds the growth of jobs. The unemployment rate of India’s youth – aged between 15 and 24 – was at 45.4% according to the latest CMIE reports. This mismatch highlights an urgent need for innovative solutions to harness the potential of India’s young demographic, ensuring sustainable economic development and progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Fostering youth entrepreneurship emerges as a key strategy in addressing this challenge, with additional emphasis on promoting entrepreneurship in rural areas. Understanding the Employment Gap India’s demographic dividend presents a unique opportunity and challenge. With more than 65% of its population under the age of 35, India boasts one of the world’s largest youth populations. However, this demographic advantage is under threat due to the slow pace of job creation in the country. According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), India’s rural labour force participation rate fell further to 39.5% in 2022-23 from already a low of 40.1% in 2021-22. This is much lower than the global estimate of 60%. Other countries in the Asian region fare much better with Indonesia at 67% and South Korea at 63%. Further, according to CMIE, the unemployment rate in India as of 2023 hovers around 7-8%, with youth unemployment significantly higher. The UN estimated that India’s working-age population (aged between 15 and 64) at 960 million in 2022. To match the labour force participation of global 60% and lower the unemployment rates in the country comparable to other countries in the region, India needs to generate at least 100 million additional jobs to provide opportunities for the young people entering the workforce every year. The Case for Youth Entrepreneurship Entrepreneurship, especially among the youth, stands out as a potent solution to this challenge. By empowering young individuals to create their own ventures, not only do we tackle the issue of unemployment head-on, but we also lay the groundwork for fostering innovation, driving economic growth, and contributing to the SDGs. Youth entrepreneurship encourages self-reliance, creates job opportunities for others, and addresses societal needs through innovative solutions. Entrepreneurial ventures are vital for generating employment, with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) playing a crucial role in most economies. According to the World Bank, SMEs account for about 90% of businesses and more than 50% of employment worldwide. In India, fostering youth entrepreneurship can significantly contribute to filling the employment gap by creating jobs not only for entrepreneurs but also for others, thus amplifying the impact on the economy. Recognizing the importance of entrepreneurship, the Indian government has launched several initiatives, such as Startup India and the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, PMEGP, Pradhan Mantri Vishwakarma Yojna, aimed at fostering a conducive ecosystem for young entrepreneurs. These programs offer financial assistance, mentorship, and support in navigating the bureaucratic landscape, thereby encouraging more young individuals to embark on entrepreneurial journeys. Overcoming Barriers Despite these efforts, young entrepreneurs face several hurdles, including access to capital, mentorship, and other business development services. Addressing these challenges through targeted policy interventions, increased access to venture capital, and providing platforms for networking and mentorship can significantly boost youth entrepreneurship. The approach for scaling entrepreneurship in rural India would require a comprehensive and collaborative framework, aimed at empowering rural entrepreneurs through a robust district level ecosystem and sub block-level support architecture. This ecosystem encompasses special nudge units within the government, district level collaborative platforms for stakeholder coordination, and digital platforms for providing business development services such as training, mentoring, and market linkage to rural entrepreneurs. Additionally, the mapping of high-potential pathways and unlocking finance through partnerships with financial institutions are pivotal components that address ecosystem gaps and facilitate access to essential resources for rural entrepreneurs. The promotion of youth entrepreneurship stands out as a critical strategy for harnessing the potential of India’s young workforce. As the country navigates the challenges of job creation in the formal sector, empowering young entrepreneurs offers a path to economic resilience, innovation, and sustainable development. By creating an ecosystem that nurtures and supports young innovators, India can ensure that its demographic dividend translates into tangible economic and social gains, securing its position as a leading economy on the global stage.

    "article_content": "In today’s fast-paced business world, sustainability is a cornerstone of firm strategy that can both improve environmental circumstances and increase financial returns. As more and more companies realize how important it is to integrate sustainability principles into their daily operations, the advantages of sustainability from an environmental and financial standpoint become increasingly apparent. By prioritizing sustainability initiatives and including employees in employee experience programs that have purpose, organizations may build a future that is more resilient, responsible, and prosperous. Sustainability’s Benefits to the Environment and Businesses: An Argument for Action When we discuss sustainability, we’re referring to a broad variety of actions that aim to reduce our impact on the environment, save resources, and inspire more responsibility in others. Sustainable business strategies provide several advantages for both organizations and the environment. Reducing waste and carbon emissions, raising stakeholder engagement, and encouraging more moral supply chains are a few of them. Environmental Benefits: Sustainable business practices result in lower greenhouse gas emissions, resource conservation, and biodiversity preservation. Reducing a company’s environmental impact contributes to the battle against climate change, ecosystem preservation, and future generations’ protection of the planet. Adopting a sustainable approach could benefit firms in many ways. Better risk management, cost reductions, and enhanced brand reputation are a few of these benefits. Sustainable firms typically experience higher levels of customer loyalty, reduced waste, and better operational efficiency, all of which contribute to their long-term financial stability and competitiveness. Increasing Employee Experience to Make a Long-Term Impact Meaningful employee experience initiatives are one of the most important ways that businesses can drive sustainability and engage their workforce. Employees are an organization’s most valuable resource; their creativity, passion, and commitment foster positive internal and external transformation. When businesses promote employee involvement in sustainability initiatives and integrate sustainability into company culture, a more sustainable future can be realized. The following are some ways that businesses might boost the effectiveness of employee experience initiatives: Employee Engagement: Employees that are engaged in their work are more likely to support environmental initiatives and contribute to changing the world. By promoting a culture of sustainability and providing chances for employees to share their knowledge, businesses may leverage the expertise and creativity of their workforce to address sustainability challenges. Programs for employee experience that prioritize sustainability offer a wealth of options for both personal and professional growth. Companies may help employees become advocates for sustainability both inside and beyond the organization by offering training, workshops, and chances for practical application of sustainability concepts. When businesses encourage their employees to participate in sustainability initiatives, the impact on the community increases. Businesses that fund environmental conservation initiatives, community outreach programs, and volunteer opportunities can inspire their staff members to make a positive impact in their local communities and advance a more sustainable society. Improving Worker Health: Participation in sustainability initiatives by a company can have a positive impact on worker satisfaction, morale, and health. Research indicates that having a feeling of purpose and meaning in one’s work is linked to higher levels of productivity, motivation, and commitment to the organization. Companies may help employees have more fulfilling and interesting work environments by aligning sustainability goals with their values and aspirations. Allowances, prizes, and incentives can be used to persuade people and businesses to combat climate change. Tax incentives can be used to encourage sustainable activities, rewards can be given for reducing carbon emissions, and investments in renewable energy projects can be permitted. Companies can motivate stakeholders to adopt sustainability by providing tangible advantages such as financial savings or recognition from the public. Case Studies from Real Life to Show the Impact of Sustainability Numerous businesses across all industries have discovered that employee experience initiatives are an effective means of promoting sustainability and producing tangible results. To give an example: Salesforce, one of the most well-known providers of cloud-based software, has made sustainability a top focus and engages staff members through its “Earthforce” program. Members of Earthforce provide their time and expertise to support environmental conservation, the reduction of carbon emissions, and the advancement of sustainable business practices. Unilever is a global maker of consumer goods, and part of its corporate culture and operations is the Sustainable Living Plan. Central to the plan is employee agency in bringing about long-term, systemic change throughout the value chain. Unilever offers training programs, sustainability challenges, and rewards for sustainability leadership as means of engaging its workforce. In conclusion, adopting sustainability can lead to a brighter future. Sustainability benefits both businesses and the environment. Businesses that prioritize sustainability initiatives and involve employees in worthwhile employee experience programs can help to build a better, more sustainable future. As we embrace sustainability as our guiding concept, let’s make the most of this complex and constantly changing environment by cooperating to create a brighter future for coming generations.

    "article_content": "Corporates have a responsibility towards the society at large aside from generating profits. After all, it is its external environment that provides the organisations with the resources it needs to become lucrative. In order to recognise this, the term Corporate Social Responsibility was coined in 1953 by the American economist Howard Bowen. Responsibility to conserving the environment is one of the types of responsibilities corporates have towards the society. With increasing instances of natural hazards occurring across the world because of climate change, it is crucial for the companies to make sure that they are not inflicting more harm on the environment, and making efforts to reverse the damage it has done in the past. Companies across the world are prioritising environment in various ways, by organising tree plantation drives, initiate energy transition to cleaner energy, and making commitments to going net-zero. Following are some of the companies who are going beyond actions to making environment conservation their mission, and are incorporating it in their operations and profit making strategies as well. Ambuja Cement Ambuja Cement is a leading cement company in India that has a vision of being the most sustainable and competitive company in its industry. Ambuja Cement demonstrates its corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the area of environment conservation through various initiatives, such as: Using clean technology and reducing carbon emissions in its operations Ambuja Cement uses state-of-the-art technology and equipment to optimize its energy efficiency and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The company has installed waste heat recovery systems, solar power plants, and wind mills to generate renewable energy. The company has also adopted the co-processing method, which involves using alternative fuels and raw materials derived from industrial and agricultural waste, to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and natural resources. As a result, Ambuja Cement has reduced its specific carbon dioxide emissions by 38% since 1990, and aims to achieve a further reduction of 21% by 2030. Conserving water resources and managing water scarcity through water harvesting, recycling, and recharge Ambuja Cement is committed to the conservation and management of water resources, as water is a vital input for its operations and the livelihoods of the communities around its sites. The company has implemented various measures to reduce its water consumption, such as installing air-cooled condensers, dry fly ash handling systems, and water meters. The company has also invested in water harvesting structures, such as check dams, ponds, and wells, to collect and store rainwater and runoff. Moreover, the company has promoted water recycling and reuse practices, such as using treated wastewater for cooling, dust suppression, and green belt development. Additionally, the company has undertaken water recharge activities, such as digging bore wells, to replenish the groundwater levels. Through these efforts, Ambuja Cement has achieved a water positive status, which means it gives back more water than it consumes, for eight consecutive years. Enhancing biodiversity and rehabilitating land around its sites through sustainable mining practices and green cover Ambuja Cement is committed to the protection and enhancement of biodiversity and ecosystems around its sites, as they provide essential services and resources for its operations and the communities. The company follows sustainable mining practices, such as conducting environmental impact assessments, obtaining necessary clearances, and implementing mitigation measures, to minimize the adverse effects of its mining activities on the environment. The company also undertakes land reclamation and rehabilitation projects, such as backfilling, leveling, and contouring, to restore the mined-out areas to their original or better condition. Furthermore, the company develops and maintains green belts around its sites, by planting native and diverse species of trees and shrubs, to create habitats for flora and fauna, improve air quality, and prevent soil erosion. The company has planted over 10 million trees across its sites, covering an area of more than 2,000 hectares. Managing waste and using alternative fuels and raw materials from industrial and agricultural sources Ambuja Cement is committed to the responsible and efficient management of waste, as waste is a potential source of energy and raw materials for its operations. The company follows the principle of reduce, reuse, and recycle, to minimize the generation of waste and maximize its utilization. The company has developed a waste management system, which involves segregating, collecting, transporting, and disposing of waste in a safe and environmentally sound manner. The company also provides sustainable waste management solutions to other industries, municipalities, and the agriculture sector, by co-processing their waste in its kilns. Co-processing is a process of using waste as a substitute for fossil fuels and natural resources in the cement manufacturing process. Co-processing not only reduces the consumption of non-renewable resources, but also eliminates the need for landfilling or incineration of waste, thereby reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. The company has co-processed over 1.5 million tonnes of waste since 2010, and aims to increase its co-processing rate to 25% by 2025. Developing innovative products and solutions such as Geoclean and True Value that measure and improve the environmental and social impact of its operations and products Ambuja Cement is committed to the innovation and development of products and solutions that enhance its environmental and social performance, as well as the value proposition for its customers and stakeholders. The company has launched Geoclean, a cement product that contains a special additive that reduces the nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions from the cement manufacturing process, as well as from the construction activities. Geoclean not only improves the air quality and health of the people, but also increases the durability and strength of the structures. The company has also introduced True Value, a methodology that quantifies and monetizes the environmental and social impact of its operations and products, using internationally accepted standards and tools. True Value helps the company to identify and address the positive and negative externalities of its business, and communicate its true worth to its stakeholders.These initiatives have helped Ambuja Cement to reduce its environmental footprint, create value for its stakeholders, and contribute to the well-being of the society. Ambuja Cement is a socially responsible corporate citizen and a leader in sustainability.

    "article_content": "The recent heatwave across north India has claimed lives of over 190 homeless people in New Delhi in 9 days, according to a report by a Delhi-based NGO. Between June 11 and 19, a total of 192 homeless people died, a report by the Centre for Holistic Development said. This data was obtained from the Zonal Integrated Police Network, Ministry of Home Affairs and tabulated by Sunil Kumar Aledia of the CHD, a member of the National Forum for Homeless Housing Rights-NFHHR. The India Meterological Department has forecast above-normal temperatures for this month as well. Delhi experienced its warmest night in over 50 years on Wednesday, with a minimum temperature of 35.2 degrees Celsius, according to data from the weather department. While it has been the most devastating for people living on the streets. heatwave has affected every individual in some form or the other. It has caused several people to fall ill, caused a loss in productivity and thus, overall loss of income for both rich, and the poor. The effects of climate change has never been so stark for Indians as they are now. This has resulted in a call for action by the population of the country. Call for Action from India and the World According a new survey, 77 per cent of Indians are demanding stronger actions against climate change. 33 per cent of Indians claimed that they have recently experience extreme weather events caused because of climate change. The Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024 survey was conducted by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) in collaboration with the University of Oxford and GeoPoll. The survey collected responses from over 75,000 people across 77 countries, representing 87 per cent of the global population. The survey reveals robust support for stronger climate measures among the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters. Majorities in these countries favour increased climate action, including 66 per cent in the US and Russia, 67 per cent in Germany, 73 per cent in China, 77 per cent in South Africa and India, 85 per cent in Brazil, 88 per cent in Iran, and up to 93 per cent in Italy. The survey has shown that climate anxiety among people is widespread. About 56 per cent people claimed that they are thinking about and are overwhelmed by climate change regularly. These concerns are higher among people from the least developed countries (LDCs), and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Cassie Flynn, Global Director of Climate Change, UNDP, said, “As world leaders decide on the next round of pledges under the Paris Agreement by 2025, these results are undeniable evidence that people everywhere support bold climate action.” “The next two years stand as one of the best chances we have as the international community to ensure that warming stays under 1.5 degrees Celsius. We stand ready to support policymakers in stepping up their efforts as they develop their climate action plans through our Climate Promise initiative,” she said. As we gear up for another round of negotiations with regards to climate change during COP29, the policymakers need to take into account the pressures and anxieties of the people as they work towards fighting against the devastating effects of climate change."

    "article_content": "An 18-year-old e-rickshaw driver named Arti from Uttar Pradesh was recognised with the Amal Clooney Women’s Empowerment Award. Arti, from Bahraich district of Uttar Pradesh was honoured with this prestigious award at the hands of King Charles III of the United Kingdom. Arti, a single mother with a 5-year-old daughter, drives a pink e-rickshaw which has enabled her to not only be financially independent but also play a role in ensuring safety of female passengers in her village. The award ceremony was held in the iconic Buckingham Palace, where Arti arrived in her pink e-rickshaw. “Arti’s determination to create a safer world for her daughter and her relentless efforts in a traditionally male-dominated field exemplifies the spirit of resilience and empowerment we seek to celebrate,” said Amal Clooney, Human Rights Lawyer, during the award ceremony. Amal Clooney Women’s Empowerment Award The Amal Clooney Women’s Empowerment Award is an accolade that was established with the purpose of recognising remarkable women that have made major contributions in the field of women’s empowerment and gender equality. It is named after the renowned British international human rights lawyer, Amal Clooney. The award does not come with any geographic restrictions for its nomination or selection process. It is sponsored by the British Charity Prince Trust International, founded by King Charles when he was the Prince of Wales. Arti was recipient of this award for her work through the Pink E-rickshaw initiative of the government, through which she is inspiring young girls in her locality to become strong and independent. What is E-Rickshaw Initiative? The government of Uttar Pradesh launched Mission Shakti in 2020 in order to empower women in the state with focus on safety, security, and self-reliance. The initiative provides a secure platform for women where they can learn, get skilled for various vocations, and access different livelihood schemes. In this manner, the women can transform their lives and become self-reliant and productive members of the society. As part of this mission, the Government of Uttar Pradesh had launched Pink E-rickshaw scheme, wherein women are provided training to drive e-rickshaws and navigate traffic rules and regulations. Once they receive the necessary training, the scheme also help women with getting e-rickshaws at a low-interest rate loan, along with a subsidy of Rs. 49,500. Arti was introduced to this initiative under Project Leher, launched by Prince’s Trust International in partnership with the Aga Khan Foundation."

    "article_content": "Organizations of all sizes have had to navigate significant upheaval over the last few years – the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the war in Ukraine and the pressure on energy prices and increasing food supply challenges. The race to reach net zero – and the challenge and opportunity this represents – has been a constant throughout. Though the context continues to be challenging, and the obstacles to reaching net zero are real, we are increasingly seeing that there are commercial benefits to be realized by organizations that prioritize their sustainability efforts. Ultimately, while setting and achieving targets might meet legal obligations and create a pleasing public image, the core potential benefit to it could actually be economic. In order to achieve a net zero, there needs to be a balance between the carbon emitted into the atmosphere, and the carbon removed from it. Reaching net zero is not only the right thing to do – there are also tangible commercial gains that can be made on the way. However, the net zero transition is complex, industry specific, and even organization specific. For example, local manufacturers will have different markets and requirements to a multi-national organization. Where evidence suggests there has been progress on the understanding of net zero, it is possible that for many organizations, an understanding of what they really need to do to make progress remains elusive. So, how can organizations take strides towards their net zero goals? 1. Climate change calls for culture change Actively decarbonizing can be seen as an opportunity to embed sustainability into the wider organizational culture and accelerate progress towards a sustainable world. Instigating a culture change needs more than just good intentions. Guidance, such as the ISO Net Zero Guidelines as well as best practice standards, can help organizations of all sizes set a strategy towards realistic net zero goals that is relevant to their particular needs and requirements. 2. Work together Setting up a sustainable supply chain can sometimes be the biggest opportunity for organizations. By accelerating engagement with supply chains, and working collaboratively upstream and downstream, organizations can partner to achieve net zero goals together. Organizations are already taking action in-house on reducing waste and energy usage and wider collaboration has the potential to help us reach net zero sooner. 3. Best practice as the benchmark In a competitive market, organizations of all sizes can benefit from a level playing field in order to work together to achieve a sustainable world. Being a first mover may seem like a risk, particularly for smaller organizations, so clear targets and a legal framework can play an important role. In addition, or in cases where regulation is yet to emerge, standards can provide a benchmark for organizations wanting to clearly demonstrate their net zero commitments. 4. Become a trusted partner As net zero becomes increasingly central to winning public and private sector contracts, organizations have the opportunity to strengthen their long-term prospects by becoming trusted supply chain partners, ultimately benefiting individuals, organizations and the planet. As other organizations seek to fulfil their net zero targets, smaller organizations can position themselves as part of the journey. Standards such as ISO 9001 and reputable schemes like Race to Zero provide credibility that will empower them and their networks to maximize these benefits. 5. Plot a course and chart the journey While the ambition is to reach net zero, setting interim targets that mark off progress can help organizations stay on track, and can help build consumer trust and brand credibility. The next step is to share progress, by publishing net zero policies, getting data verified by a third-party, such as The Carbon Disclosure Project, and being transparent about the actions that have been taken. Good management practices, energy management, water management, supply chain, and procurement can be essential first elements to get things under control. There could be a view that the onus is on the Government to drive change through legislation. But collaboration across society will also help move the dial and ultimately achieve progress on Net Zero. The impetus is no longer merely a moral one, or even a legislative one – research suggests consumers and clients expect meaningful action towards net zero goals, and we can expect this to have an increasing impact on the bottom line of organizations. Those that grasp the opportunity and start to turn their ambitions into tangible actions now have the opportunity to help everyone reap the rewards of a more sustainable world.

    "article_content": "Water is one of our most precious and undervalued resources. We need it to maintain good health and a biodiverse environment, to grow food and across every industry. Access to clean water is at the forefront of building a more equitable society, which is why the UN included this in the Sustainable Development Goals. However, recent events have challenged the perception that drought and flooding are rare. As the climate crisis intensifies, communities are increasingly facing challenges arising from too little and too much water. Effective management of water has never been so important. Levels of water scarcity are soaring globally, however data suggests that India is one of the countries most at risk. India’s relationship with water is complex and multifaceted due to the country’s diverse geography, climate, population, agriculture-dependence and socio-economic factors. Water plays a critical role in all aspects of India’s society, economy, and environment. This recent report by BSI, Thirst for Change: Securing a Water-positive Future which includes an Indicator evaluating water scarcity in 40 locations, with the US, China and India receiving the highest possible rating. According to the report, India has the highest agricultural water usage, even ahead of China. Along with China, India faces the challenge of high utilization and low levels of renewable water per capita. Water resources are already under pressure and vulnerable to scarcity risks, and the high leakage level of 86 liters per person per day further compounds the challenge for India. Currently, India’s personal water use is relatively low, but this could leave the country highly vulnerable if personal consumption increases from the current levels. The large cities of Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore are already known to face severe water stress. A comprehensive approach involving policy reforms, community engagement, technological innovations, and responsible water management practices can help us address India’s water challenges. For example, in 2019 Chennai reduced its consumption of fresh water by becoming the first India city to recycle its wastewater at scale to meet the non-drinking water needs of its industries. Its two Tertiary Treatment Reverse Osmosis (TTRO) plants helped to recycle about 20% of Chennai’s sewage resulting in a more sustainable water source for the population. Likewise, efforts to mitigate the impact of floods and droughts have been made through various hydrology projects that introduced systems and technology that gave reservoir managers an accurate picture of the water situation unfolding in their region in order to improve the overall management of water resources in the country. There is a need for organizations and the government to set standards in water management that ensure efficient utilization of this important resource. For example, ISO 46001, the water efficiency management systems standard, enables organizations to assess and account for their water use, and to identify, plan and implement measures to achieve water savings through the systematic management of water. Furthermore, research identifies that using water wisely can bring important benefits, including enabling equitable global access, protecting precious habitats, and making us more resilient to climate change and drought. Few things to consider are: 1. Recognize water wastage as a serious challenge – Acknowledge the issue and act, with utility companies leading the way to reduce network leakage 2. Ensure it is easy to choose water-saving products and make sustainable choices – for example, learning from countries including Australia and Singapore, which apply mandatory product water efficiency labelling systems, aligned with the relevant standard 3. Embrace innovation and make better use of data – smart meters have the potential to be a game changer when it comes to saving water 4. Encourage a water-saving culture – Prioritize protecting our planet through water management, whether that is at home or in the workplace, and across different sectors 5. Close the loop – Make water recycling and reuse the norm where possible, using techniques such as water recycling and water reuse in new buildings, or rainwater harvesting 6. Partner for impact – Collaborative effort across a wide range of players from government and regulators to the water industry and ultimately, all of us as water users can help us address the growing challenges around water availability. Whilst water is abundant on Earth, the fact just 0.5% is considered accessible freshwater means that managing its use is critical. By 2050 more than 5 billion people are expected to be facing inadequate access to water at least one month per year means water security deserves as great a focus as the wider climate challenge. Indeed, given that water provision and how we use water contribute around 10% to global carbon emissions, we cannot tackle one without the other. It is simply not sustainable for demand for water to continue to rise without action to ensure we are managing it efficiently. But taking steps to secure a water positive future is about accelerating progress for people and planet. Ultimately, all of us stand to benefit from turning ambition into action to secure our future water supply and accelerate progress to a sustainable world.

    "article_content": "समूचे देश में चिलचिलाती गर्मी की शुरुआत हो चुकी है। इस भीषण गर्मी के बीच पानी की समस्या भी गंभीर होती जा रही है। देश के कई शहरों और इलाकों में इसका असर देखने को मिल रहा है। ऐसे में कॉरपोरेट सोशल रिस्पांसिबिलिटी की मदद से आम जनमानस को राहत देने की कोशिश की जा रही है। जल संरक्षण के लिए सीएसआर फंड (CSR Fund) की मदद से मध्य प्रदेश (Madhya Pradesh News) में एक अनोखा काम किया जा रहा है। पानी की कमी से निजात पाने के लिए रिचार्ज सॉफ्ट बनाया जा रहा है। दरअसल सीएसआर के माध्यम से इंदौर नगर निगम ( Indore Nagar Nigam ) द्वारा शहर के अलग-अलग जगहों पर जलजमाव वाले क्षेत्रों की सूची बनाने के साथ-साथ अब उन स्थानों पर रिचार्ज शाफ्ट यानी कि बारिश का पानी बोरिंग कर जमीन में भेजने की कवायद शुरू हो गई है। सौ से ज्यादा ऐसे स्थान चिन्हित किये गए है जहां जलजमाव होता है और उन जगहों पर वाटर रिचार्ज सॉफ्ट बनाया जा रहा है। इंदौर नगर निगम के इस सीएसआर पहल से दूर होगी पानी की समस्या Water Recharge Shaft के इस पहल के लिए शुरुआती दौर में कई बड़ी कंपनियों का सहारा लेकर इंदौर नगर निगम (Indore Municipal Corporation) यह काम सीएसआर प्रोजेक्ट (CSR Project) के तहत कर रहा है। इंदौर शहर के कई क्षेत्रों में जलस्तर लगातार कम होने की शिकायतों के साथ-साथ कई क्षेत्रों में बोरिंग बंद होने के मामले सामने आ रहे हैं। इसी के चलते Indore नगर निगम और कई संस्थाओं ने इसके लिए अभियान शुरू किया है। आम जनमानस की भागीदारी को बढ़ाने के लिए लोगों को जागरूक किया जा रहा है। रेसिडेंट एसोसिएशन की मदद भी ली जा रही है, बड़ी कार्यशाला का आयोजन भी किया जा रहा है। गौरतलब है कि नगर निगम ने पहले चरण में शहर के सौ ऐसे स्थानों का चयन किया है जहां हर बार बारिश का पानी जमा होता है और इस जलजमाव के कारण लोगों को दिक्कतों का सामना करना पड़ता है। इसी के चलते निगम इन स्थानों पर रिचार्ज शाफ्ट लगा रहा है। सीएसआर की मदद से इंदौर में बनाया जा रहा है वाटर रिचार्जिंग शाफ़्ट इस तकनीक के तहत उन क्षेत्रों में एक सुरक्षित स्थान पर बोरिंग कराया जाता है और उस बोरिंग के माध्यम से बारिश का पानी फिर से जमीन में भेजा जाता है। The CSR Journal से खास बातचीत करते हुए Indore Municipal Corporation के एडिशनल कमिश्नर अभिलाष मिश्रा ने बताया कि फिलहाल इस पहल के लिए कई स्थानीय कंपनियों की मदद से सीएसआर (कॉरपोरेट सोशल रिस्पांसिबिलिटी – Corporate Social Responsibility) के तहत कार्य कराए जा रहे हैं। IMC के Additional Municipal Commissioner Abhilash Mishra ने लोगों से अपील भी की कि इस पहल में लोग आगे आएं और Water Recharge Shaft के लिए अपना योगदान दें। हम आपको बता दें कि अब तक शहरभर में बोरिंग इसलिए किए जाते रहे हैं कि ताकि जमीन से पानी हासिल किया जा सके, लेकिन अब निगम द्वारा विभिन्न कंपनियों की मदद से बोरिंग कराकर बारिश का पानी जमीन में भेजा जाएगा। यानी कि रिचार्ज शाफ्ट से रिवर्स बोरिंग किया जा रहा है। कॉरपोरेट की मदद से पानी की समस्या से मिलेगी निजात सीएसआर प्रोजेक्ट के तहत जलजमाव वाले क्षेत्रों में लगाए जा रहे एक सिस्टम पर दो लाख रुपए का खर्च होता है, क्योंकि इसमें उस क्षेत्र में बोरिंग करने के साथ-साथ उसके लिए तमाम उपकरण भी लगाए जाते हैं, ताकि बारिश का पानी आसानी से जमीन में पहुंचाया जा सके। कुछ स्थानों पर कम्पनी की मदद से तो कुछ स्थानों पर निगम अपने स्तर पर यह कार्य कराएगा। शहरभर में 200 स्थानों पर यह कार्य होना है और आने वाले दिनो में कुछ बड़ी फर्मों को काम सौंपे जाएंगे। इस काम से जलजमाव की भी स्थिति से निजात मिलेगी साथ ही पानी की भी कमी को दूर किया जा सकेगा।"

    "article_content": "Oxfam India’s 2020 virtual Trailwalker challenge concluded on a triumphant note on 29 November. This fundraiser gave thousands an opportunity to help them and also raise money for Oxfam India’s ongoing COVID-19 relief work, and their #RightsOverProfits campaign. The total amount raised by the walkathon was over Rs. 50 lakh. Two editions spread across five months saw participation from first time enthusiasts to seasoned marathoners, lone runners to corporate teams, from all corners of the world — the fundraiser attracted almost 5,000 people who supported Oxfam India’s initiative to help pandemic-hit migrant workers. This year’s theme of the Oxfam Trailwalker was ‘Walk in solidarity’ and the focus was on ending economic discrimination of vulnerable and marginalised citizens, especially the migrant labourers who went through enormous hardships and tragedy during and after the lockdown. Three Trailwalkers also achieved seemingly impossible feats in the process. Pankaj Maste from Mumbai completed over 100 km in just one day while Anupama Singha Roy from Bengaluru and Sanjiv Sharma from New Delhi completed 50 km in one day as well! Team participation from corporates like Salesforce, Accenture, Wells Fargo, Thomson Reuters and Schlumberger gave a big boost to the fundraising efforts. Thanks to such support in the past few months, Oxfam India has managed to reach out to underserved citizens in 16 states, provided one month’s dry ration to 387,495 people, distributed 60,080 ready-to-eat meal packets, distributed 57,424 safety kits and transferred Rs 264.45 lakh to 5289 households. Critical information about the pandemic has reached over 5 million people and 6,626 PPE Kits have been provided to front-line workers and hospitals. Amitabh Behar, Chief Executive Officer of Oxfam India says, “We have tried with action and intent to reach out to the most vulnerable sections not just with tangible gestures but with information that can save lives. None of this however would have been possible without the support of the thousands who backed our fundraising efforts wholeheartedly and made it possible for us to help so many people.” This massive effort was a virtual version of Oxfam India’s annual mega walkathon recognised world-wide as the Oxfam Trailwalker challenge. This year, because of the pandemic, participants had to take part “virtually” and complete the challenge in and around around their homes, with social distancing norms in place. The concept of the virtual Trailwalker made it very easy and simple for anyone around the globe to participate by just signing up on the Oxfam India website and choosing to cover 50 kms or 100 kms within 10 days.

    "article_content": "NGOs play a crucial role in improving the lives of people who have been affected by natural disasters or are facing other challenges. NGOs can act as implementers, catalysts, and partners to provide essential goods and services to those in need. In India, there are NGOs working for quality education, healthcare, nutrition, animal welfare, environmental conservation, for the marginalised sections of the society and in remote and backward areas, sometimes in collaboration with the government, sometimes with corporates through CSR or through independent donations. The nonprofit sector of our country serves as the infrastructure for corporate social responsibility. NGOs, or non-governmental organisations, are important players in this area, putting CSR strategies into practice and carrying out a variety of humanitarian programmes. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs’ (MCA) CSR regulations give specific weight to an NGO’s position as a partner in corporate citizenship implementation. On World NGO Day, The CSR Journal takes a look into few of the top NGOs operating in India for various causes.

    "article_content": "छत्तीगढ़ के रायगढ़ जिले के जिलाधिकारी तारन प्रकाश सिन्हा (DM Taran Prakash Sinha ) की मेहनत रंग ला रही है। पूरे जिले के लगभग 200 तालाब बारिश के पानी से लबालब भर चुके है। तालाब में पानी भरने की वजह से जिले में जल संरक्षण का सकारात्मक परिणाम देखने को मिल रहा है। इतना ही नहीं तालाब भरने की वजह से ग्राउंड वाटर (Ground Water in Chhattisgarh) भी रिचार्ज हो रहा है और इसके साथ ही जिले में पानी की भी किल्लत से निजात मिल रहा है। गौरतलब है कि छत्तीगढ़ (Chhattisgarh Election News) के रायगढ़ जिले में जल संरक्षण की दिशा में ऐतिहासिक काम करते हुए बारिश के करोड़ों लीटर पानी को सहेजने जिले में 170 तालाबों का जीर्णोद्धार किया गया है। जिसमें से 105 तालाब अमृत सरोवर, 55 तालाब सीएसआर (CSR) और 10 तालाबों का डीएमएफ व दूसरे मदों से जीर्णोद्धार किया गया है। अब ये तालाब लबालब भर चुके हैं जिसमे करोड़ों लीटर पानी सहेजा जा रहा है। सीएसआर से हो रहा है जल संरक्षण (Water Conservation in Chhattisgarh) जिलाधिकारी तारन प्रकाश सिन्हा के नेतृत्व में जल संरक्षण की दिशा में बारिश के पानी को सहेजने जिले के अलग-अलग तालाबों के साफ -सफाई और गहरीकरण का काम हालही में किया गया। अमृत सरोवर की खुदाई मनरेगा से की गई, वहीं जिले के विभिन्न कॉरपोरेट्स को Corporate Social Responsibility के तहत अलग अलग तालाबों को संवारने का जिम्मा दिया गया था। तालाबों में में जमी गाद और कचरे को साफ किया गया। जिससे तालाब (Ponds) की गहराई और क्षेत्रफल बढ़ा।बारिश के पानी से एक तालाब में ही बारिश का लगभग 1 करोड़ लीटर तक ज्यादा पानी संचित हो पा रहा है। जल संरक्षण के साथ भू-जल स्तर में भी हो रहा है सुधार हम आपको बता दें कि तालाब हमारे आस-पास जन जीवन का अभिन्न अंग है। यह न केवल गांवों में विभिन्न जरूरतों के लिए जल उपलब्ध कराते हैं बल्कि ग्रामीण जन जीवन और अर्थव्यवस्था को सशक्त बनाने में महती भूमिका निभाते हैं। आज जब गर्मी की चपेट में आकर जल स्रोतों के सूखने को घटनाएं सामने आती रहती हैं। ऐसे समय में रायगढ़ जिले में कलेक्टर तारन प्रकाश सिन्हा के नेतृत्व में जल संरक्षण और संवर्धन की दिशा में यह एक बेहद महत्वपूर्ण पहल किया गया। इसके अंतर्गत गांवों में ऐसे तालाब जिनका अस्तित्व सिमटता जा रहा था उन्हें सहेजने की ओर कदम बढ़ाए गए। CSR Funds से खोदे गए तालाब, बचेगा जल, संवरेगा कल तालाब भरने के बाद भू-जल स्तर (Ground Water in Chhattisgarh) में भी सुधार होगा। ग्राम वासियों और पशुपालकों को रोजमर्रा की जरूरत के लिए पानी मिलता है। मछली पालन और दूसरी आर्थिक गतिविधियों की संभावनाएं बढ़ती हैं। तालाब को गहरा करने के लिए जल संरक्षण के साथ रोजगार के अवसर भी तैयार हुए हैं। इस पूरे प्रोजेक्ट में 20 करोड़ रुपए की लागत आई है। गहरीकरण और साफ -सफाई से तालाब और आस-पास की सुंदरता बढ़ेगी। तालाबों के जीर्णोद्धार से यहां करीब 1 करोड़ लीटर तक बारिश का पानी ज्यादा स्टोर किया जा रहा है। जिससे आस-पास के लगभग 20 से 25 एकड़ में भू-जल स्तर बढ़ेगा। सिंचाई की सुविधा भी बेहतर होगी।"

    "article_content": "Cycling is a very enjoyable exercise which makes a person relaxed and happy. It is a low impact aerobic exercise which anybody belonging to any age group can do. Cycling does not cost you a bomb and is also a great way to contribute to environmental conservation as it is a sustainable activity. Every year, World Bicycle Day is observed on the 3 rd of June raise awareness about the immense benefits of cycling and to encourage more people to ride a bicycle. While cycling all the way to your school, college or workplace can be a great choice for those staying closer to their educational institutions and workplaces, those who are unable to do this, can ride a bicycle to the local market, grocery shop, and railway station or while visiting friends and neighbours. One can also enrol in cycling groups which make a tour of any city especially on weekends. Cycling is known to boost our heart health, prevent cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and also benefits cancer patients! While the health benefits of cycling are many, this activity also boosts our mental health and helps in combating stress, anxiety and depression. It is a great way to increase our fitness and overall wellbeing. Why should we ride a bicycle? Cycling increases fitness Cycling makes a person lean and fit. Cycling leads to increased muscle strength and flexibility. Cycling is an aerobic activity, which benefits our heart, blood vessels and lungs. Cycling makes us breathe deeper, it makes us sweat and increases our body temperature, all of which contribute in enhancing our overall fitness level. Cycling makes our legs stronger Cycling uses all of the major muscle groups as you pedal. It improves our bones and muscles. This practice improves the overall function in the lower portion of our body and strengthens our leg muscles without negatively impacting our joints. Regular cycling benefits our quadriceps, gluteal muscles, hamstrings, and calf muscle. Cycling helps in weight loss For people who are struggling to lose weight, cycling can be your best choice! Cycling regularly is a great choice for burning our calories and reduce body fat. Cycling increases our metabolic rate, builds muscle and burns body fat. Regular cycling and following a healthy eating plan can help in fighting obesity and bring a person back to shape. Cycling for at least 30 to 45 minutes a day is recommended for someone trying to lose weight. Cycling prevents diseases In today’s time, there are multiple health risks associated with a sedentary lifestyle such as obesity, heart diseases, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, stroke, metabolic problems, type 2 diabetes and even certain cancers such as colon, breast, and uterine cancers. Cycling can help to protect you from serious diseases such as stroke, heart attack, some cancers, depression, diabetes, obesity and arthritis. Cycling boosts our heart rate, improves cardiovascular function, and enhances our overall fitness level. Regular cycling can help prevent heart issues such as stroke, heart attack, and high blood pressure. While cycling reduces our risk of cardiovascular diseases, it is also lower chances of diabetes, physical inactivity, and high blood pressure. Type 2 diabetes is a major public health concern especially in India and lack of physical activity is one of the major reasons behind this. According to a research done in Finland, people who cycled for more than 30 minutes per day had a 40 per cent lower risk of developing diabetes. Cycling can benefit cancer patients Being physically active while undergoing cancer treatment is highly recommended as it benefits one’s health and fitness and improves their mental wellbeing. Exercises like cycling are suggested for people who are recovering from cancer. However, this is not applicable for cancer patients who experience low energy and pain during treatment. Cycling may reduce risk for certain types of cancer, including breast cancer. Cycling boosts mental health Cycling is known to reduce stress, anxiety and depression and boosts our mental health. Cycling releases endorphins also known as ‘feel-good’ hormones. These hormones help to relax our mind and make us feel happier. Cycling is a great way to boost our mood and reduce feelings of anxiety. Cycling on a regular basis also substantially reduces stress. Conclusion Bicycles are easily available on rent almost in all Indian cities and towns and the rent is cheap. Hence, for riding a bicycle, you do not necessarily have to buy one. If you are still not riding a bicycle, why don’t you try one today?"

    "article_content": "Did you know that you cannot wake up one morning saying “I will donate blood” and walk into your nearest hospital or blood donation camp? There are guidelines and health conditions which make you eligible or ineligible for blood donation. World Blood Donor Day is observed on the 14th of June every year across the world to raise awareness of the need for safe blood and blood products and to thank voluntary, unpaid blood donors for their life-saving gifts of blood. World Blood Donor Day is celebrated on the birth anniversary of Karl Landsteiner, who discovered the ABO blood group system. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Blood Donor Day theme for this year is ‘celebrating 20 years of giving: thank you blood donors!’ Blood donation serves to give patients access to safe blood and blood products in adequate amount, blood being a major component of our body. Blood donation is an unselfish act as we often donate blood for people who we do not know. However, a person willing to donate blood has to fit into certain criteria for being eligible. This is the reason why a thorough health check-up is done before blood donation to ensure the donor’s well-being. On World Blood Donor Day, let us learn about the eligibility criteria for blood donation in India. Age, sex and general health To be able to donate blood a person should be aged between 18 and 60 years Any Gay or Transgender person is ineligible to donate blood in our country. India has had an official ban on blood donations by transgender persons since 2017. Transgender persons, gay men and female sex workers are considered to be a high-risk HIV/AIDS category and prohibit them from donating blood. The donor’s Haemoglobin count should not be less than 12.5 g/Dl. A test will be administered at the donation site. In many countries, a haemoglobin level of not less than 12.0 g/dl for females and not less than 13.0 g/dl for males as the threshold, informs World Health Organization (WHO). The donor’s Pulse rate should be between 50 and 100/minute with no irregularities The donor’s Blood Pressure should be 100-180 mm Hg for Systolic and 50 – 100 mm Hg for Diastolic The donor’s body temperature should be Normal – 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit with oral temperature not exceeding 37.5 degrees Celsius Additional requirements A person donating blood should not have been treated for Rabies or received Hepatitis B immune vaccine in the past one year. A person willing to donate blood should not get a tattoo, ear or skin piercing or acupuncture in the past six months. Donor should not have received blood or blood products in the past six months. Donor should not have any serious illness or undergone any major surgery in the past six months. Donor should not come in contact with any person with hepatitis or yellow jaundice in the past six months. Donor should not have donated blood in the past three months. Donor should not have undergone treatment for Malaria in the past three months. Donor should not have had any immunizations in the past one month. Donor should not have taken any antibiotics or any other medications (Allopathic or Ayurveda or Sidha or Homeo) in the past 48 hours. Donor should not have consumed alcoholic beverages in the past 24 hours. Donor should not have taken aspirin in the past 72 hours. Donor should not have undergone any dental procedure in the past 72 hours. If you have visited the dentist for a minor procedure you must wait 24 hours before donating; for major work wait a month, says World Health Organization (WHO). Diseases, illnesses, menstruation and pregnancy Donor should not be suffering from any transmittable diseases. Donor should not be suffering from cough and cold, influenza or sore throat. Pregnant or lactating women are not eligible to donate blood. Women who have had miscarriage in the past 6 months are not eligible to donate blood. Any woman during her menstrual cycles is not eligible to donate blood. Donor should not have Diabetes Donor should not be suffering from chest pain, heart disease, high Blood Pressure, cancer, blood clotting problem or blood disease, unexplained fever, weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, enlarged lymph nodes in armpits, neck or groin, white patches in the mouth etc. A person who has ever suffered from TB, bronchial asthma or allergic disorder, liver disease, kidney disease, fits or fainting, blue or purple spots on the skin or mucous membranes, received human pituitary – growth hormones etc. is ineligible for blood donation. Behaviours Donor should not engage in “at risk” sexual activity in the past 12 months. A female sex worker is ineligible to donate blood in India. A person who has ever had a positive test for HIV (AIDS virus) is not eligible to donate blood. A person who has ever injected recreational drugs is not eligible to donate blood. Travel History People who have recently travelled to certain regions or countries may be restricted from donating blood due to potential outbreaks in those areas. Travel to areas where mosquito-borne infections are endemic, e.g. malaria, dengue and Zika virus infections, may result in a temporary deferral, as per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Conclusion If you are a resident of India, then you must follow our national eligibility guidelines to be able to donate blood. Guidelines laid down by the Ministry of Health, Government of India have to be followed by blood banks for donor screening."

जबकि ये सभी 31 लाख एनजीओ समाज की भलाई के लिए काम करते हैं। आपको जानकर ये भी हैरानी होगी कि भले देश में इतने NGO हैं। लेकिन ये NGO सुचारु रूप से काम नही करते हैं। ज्यादातर NGO कागज़ों तक ही सीमित हैं। इसका मुख्य कारण है सही जानकारी का न होना, NGO में मैनेजमेंट का अभाव और सबसे महत्वपूर्ण धन का अभाव, इन एनजीओ के लिए फंडिंग का नहीं होना। फ़ाइनेंशियल फंडिंग नहीं होने से ज्यादातर NGO निष्क्रिय है एनजीओ को समाज सेवा या सामाजिक हित से संबंधित कामों के लिए खोला जाता हैं लेकिन इससे समाज सेवा के साथ पैसा कमाने, टैक्स बचाने, राजनीति में करियर बनाने जैसे बहुत से व्यक्तिगत लाभ को अगर कोई देखता है तो वही एनजीओ की अहमियत खत्म हो जाती है। ऐसे में एनजीओ का अगर संचालन बिना स्वार्थ के और सामाजिक बदलाव की संकल्पना को ध्यान में रखते हुए निरंतर अगर आप काम करते रहेंगे तो एनजीओ को खोलने का मकसद भी सार्थक होगा। अब एक एनजीओ को चलाने के लिए बहुत जरुरी होता है लगातार फंडिंग का आना। हालांकि आर्थिक अनुदान पाना एक एनजीओ के लिए सबसे कठिन काम होता हैं यदि आप सही और प्रोफेशनल तरीके से काम नही करते हैं। ऐसे में NGO के लिए धन जुटाना असंभव सा लगने लगता हैं। तो आईये आपको बताते है कुछ ऐसे तरीकों के बारे में, जिससे आप अपने एनजीओ के लिए ज्यादा से ज्यादा धन जुटा सकेंगे। फंडिंग के लिए एनजीओ का विश्वसनीयता होना जरुरी किसी भी एनजीओ को अगर आर्थिक मदद चाहिए तो सबसे पहले उसे अपनी क्रेडिबिलिटी को, अपनी विश्वसनीयता को सामाजिक तौर पर साबित करनी पड़ेगी। आपकी पूरी जानकारी को सार्वजनिक करनी पड़ेगी। आप किस फील्ड में काम करते है, कैसे करते है, कहां करते है, इसका पूरा ब्यौरा आपको साझा करनी पड़ेगी। आपको अपने एनजीओ की जानकारी के लिए वेबसाइट बनवानी पड़ेगी। एनजीओ के कार्यो को और उसकी पूरी जानकारी वेबसाइट पर दे सकते हैं जिससे लोगो का NGOs के प्रति विश्वास बढेगा और वे आपको वित्तीय सहायता भी प्रदान करेंगे। इससे आपके एनजीओ का प्रचार भी अच्छा होगा और आपकी पहुंच ज्यादा से ज्यादा लोगो तक होगी। आप अपने वेबसाइट पर Donation Form भी लगा सकते हैं जिससे पैसा डायरेक्ट NGOs के बैंक अकाउंट में आ जाएगा। एनजीओ के लिए सरकारी फंड | Government Funds for NGO एनजीओ कई तरीकों से फंडिंग जुटा सकते हैं, सरकारी व प्राइवेट कंपनियां एनजीओ को ग्रांट दे सकती हैं, यहां तक कि पीएसयू और कॉर्पोरेट्स अपने सीएसआर फंड का इस्तेमाल एनजीओ के जरिये करवा सकती है। ये पीएसयू और कॉर्पोरेट्स NGO को एम्प्लिमेंटिंग एजेंसीज के तौर पर नियुक्त भी कर सकती है। यदि आपका एनजीओ रजिस्टर हैं तो आप सरकारी फंड ले सकते हैं। सरकार द्वारा कुछ नियम और कानून होंते हैं जिसके अनुसार आपको अपना Document Submit करना होता हैं। सरकारी फंड प्राप्त करने में थोड़ी दिक्कतें जरूर होती हैं पर सही तरीके से प्रयास करने पर आप सरकार वित्तीय सहायता पा सकते हैं। भारत सरकार द्वारा आर्थिक ग्रांट (Financial Grant) पाने के इच्छुक सभी वॉलंटरी आर्गेनाईजेशन यानी वीओ / NGO यानी गैर-सरकारी संगठनों को NGO Darpan या फिर मिनिस्ट्री ऑफ़ सोशल जस्टिस के वेबसाइट पर अपना पंजीकरण कराना होगा। NGO Darpan पोर्टल में पंजीकृत VO / NGO को एक विशिष्ट आईडी प्रदान करेगा। एनजीओ को अपना डिटेल्स देना पड़ेगा कि उनका एरिया ऑफ़ ऑपरेशन क्या है ?, ऑडिटेड अकाउंट की डिटेल्स, एनजीओ की विशेषताएं बतानी पड़ेगी। भारत सरकार भी तमाम परियोजनाएं चलती है, स्वच्छ भारत योजना, बेटी बचाओ, बेटी पढ़ाओ योजना जैसी योजनाएं भारत सरकार चलाती है। इनका इम्प्लीमेंटेशन यही एनजीओ करती है। जिसके लिए इन NGO को भारत सरकार के विभिन्न मंत्रालय ग्रांट यानी फंडिंग देते हैं। मंत्रालय वर्तमान में लक्षित समूहों जैसे अनुसूचित जातियों, अन्य पिछड़ा वर्गों, अल्पसंख्यकों, वृद्धों, नशीली दवाओं के दुरुपयोग के पीड़ितों, स्ट्रीट चिल्ड्रेन, विकलांग के कल्याण के लिए विशेष रूप पृथक डिज़ाइन की गई स्कीमों के अंतर्गत समाज के पिछड़े वर्गों गैर-सरकारी संगठनों को सहायता प्रदान करता है। सहायता के लिए आवेदन करने के पात्र कौन हैं?

    "article_content": "By Sumeet Sandhu, General Manager, Resource Generation – South, CRY What do you want to become when you grow up? Doctor? Engineer? Entrepreneur? Well, ‘Fundraiser’ doesn’t even feature in the list. However, when exploring an alternative career is becoming a more mainstream conversation, the option of ‘fundraising’ certainly pops out. For many fundraisers in the industry currently, a fundraising career came as “second innings”, something we happened to fall into. But is it worth chasing as a career option? What is fundraising? The process of collecting money as donations, for a charitable cause from individuals, companies and businesses is called ‘Fund-Raising’. This is one of the main tools of functioning for non-profit organizations. The growth of the development sector has seen lot of NGOs come alive in the last decade. Though the concept of fundraising is widely accepted in the western world, it still doesn’t enjoy the confidence of the Indian career-seekers. With technology, there is a drift in the mindset heralding a positive change. While still first thoughts of fundraising generate thoughts of people in the street vying for attention with folders and flyers, or strangers knocking on doors, there is much more to it than what meets the eye. Fundraising for a noble cause, executed with honesty, has garnered mass appeal. The erstwhile US President Barack Obama chose this route, and organized a successful fundraising campaign raising $778,642,962 USD, before he got elected in 2008. Fundraising in India It might be surprising but the fact remains that the Indian Non-profit sector is the largest in the world. The largest pie being held by religious NGOs, followed by community/ social services and than by education. Recent legal changes (mandatory corporate social responsibility in India being introduced in the Companies Act in 2013), more wealth being generated within the country resulting in more funds available for non-profits and high attrition rate in corporate sector resulting in large influx of talent into non-profit sector, are the probable causes contributing to the rapid growth of the development sector in the last decade. The fundraising industry in India is divided into mainly 3 sectors: Individual giving (individuals donating in their personal capacity), Corporates or the Corporate Social Responsibility sector, Institutional grants (large social sector institutions coming forward to support social causes). Many tools like Online crowd-funding, Fundraising events, Cause related marketing campaigns or partnerships have recently gained traction to drive high growth in the industry. While the new tactics are spreading its roots, the traditional ways of meeting people face to face or door to door is still quite prevalent. The western world continues to lead in Innovation by coming out with marquee appeal campaigns like Ice-bucket challenge, Red Nose Tuesday etc. The Human Connection The evolution of fundraising has been based on the foundation of “the human connection”, to reach out to the goodness of each person and administer inspiring ways to motivate them to donate. Most believe, for obvious reasons, fundraising means “raising money” or “asking people for money”, but the fundamental aspect of fundraising is about human relationships. The fulcrum of fundraising lies in its cause. Honesty is the secret of a good fundraising campaign no matter what the platform or channel used while the need of human-connect remains paramount. Who makes the cut? The most important requirement in a fundraiser boils down to “being comfortable asking for money”. The good news is there are no professional qualifications/ certifications you need, to be a fund-raiser, but yes qualifications and relevant experience does help. Basic skill sets of good communication, inter-personal and organizational skills, go a long way in crafting out a career in the field. A sales and marketing background, or an orientation for the same, aligns with the demands of work. While there is no specific genre of education required, ability to think-on-your-feet, to articulate the cause effectively, build-a-connect with the potential donor, being able to respond to donor queries satisfactorily, are some of the must-haves. It helps to remember that an act of charity is a manifestation of kindness which needs to be handled with gratitude and grace. A college graduate from a communication or management background or anyone who has a specific experience in the development sector will find it easier, having said that the core of pre-requisites remains an undying passion and an unfaltering belief towards the cause. There are examples of fundraisers climbing up the ladder and taking senior roles in reputed organizations. CRY is one such repository of examples. The wisdom of sensitivity and the importance of diplomacy within the cusp of strategy also equip a person to take up hardcore corporate roles in the domains of marketing and strategy. Preparing for fundraising Though professional education in the development sector is still at a nascent stage, this sector is seeing some excitement too. TISS (Tata Institute of Social Sciences) continues to be the oldest and most respected institution, new institutes like ISDM (Indian School of Development Management) are making a mark. Is it for me? If you happen to be someone, who is not able to see something that isn’t right, or just walk past it (poverty, injustice, abuse, hunger) and has a strong urge to do something about it, to change it, make a difference; then “Fundraising might be the career path you have been looking for”. And yes, the well-known “Maslow’s hierarchy of needs” theory applies to a choice of career too; you do want a sense of purpose along with financial security, which fundraising offers. The salaries in the sector might not be comparable to the corporate world, but it does get you by if your financials needs are not top-of-line, and the satisfaction of doing something meaningful, compensates for it by offering some purpose in a world that is rather transactional.

    "article_content": "Kendriya Sainik Board exclusively partnered with free fundraising platform Crowdera to garner support on comprehensive fundraising strategies including crowdfunding for their campaigns, corporate fundraising, and team fundraising. Since partnering with Crowdera, on their fundraising platform, Kendriya Sainik Board has to date raised ₹2,04,64,407.

More than 60,000 jawans retire every year as they need to mandatorily retire after service of 15-20 years. Most of them are in the age group of just 35-40 years at the time of retirement. The aim of the campaign is to support and educate the children of retired servicemen, Financial assistance to ex-servicemen in Penury.” While exhorting support for the campaign, Chet Jainn, CEO & Founder Crowdera, said “Freedom comes at a price and we need to take some time out to reflect on the liberties we enjoy and take for granted; liberties that are enabled only because of our defence forces. Contributing to this campaign will be our way of showing our respect and gratitude to those who keep us free.” Kendriya Sainik Board wants to make an appeal to Indian nationals, influencers, celebrities, CEOs, and philanthropists to join them in fundraising for the brave ex-servicemen of our country. Since its campaign launch on Crowdera’s crowdfunding platform, the campaign has raised more than Rs. 2.04 crores for the welfare of the ex-servicemen of India, but substantial support is still needed. This campaign is already being supported by prominent personalities across the nation including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Amitabh Bachchan, Amir Khan, Akshay Kumar, and Pawan Kalyan.

    "article_content": "Menstruation is a natural phenomenon that every woman goes through. However, lack of proper knowledge about menstrual hygiene is a major issue for women living in slum areas. It often leads to poor hygiene, infections, and other health problems, further exacerbating their struggles and hampering their overall progress. Even though we are progressing as a nation and winning accolades on the global stage, rural India continues to battle challenges like poor menstrual hygiene, taboos, superstitions and lack of awareness. It is a shocking fact that menstruation acts as a major barrier to girls’ education and women’s participation in the workforce in rural area even today. On April 10, 2023, the Supreme Court of India called for a ‘uniform national policy’ to be developed by the Central Government, in consultation with States and Union Territories, to ensure menstrual hygiene in schools. The policy aims to provide sanitary pads, vending and disposal mechanisms, and exclusive washrooms for girl students in schools. On Menstrual Hygiene Day 2024, The CSR Journal takes a look at some of the latest Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives which aim to spread awareness around menstrual health and hygiene in India thus empowering adolescent girls and women. Top CSR projects working towards menstrual health and hygiene in India CSR of Union Bank of India Union Bank of India is running a CSR initiative to promote menstrual hygiene and maintain a hygienic waste management system. The bank is installing sanitary pad vending machines and sanitary pad disposal machines in government or government-aided schools under the jurisdiction of its 134 regional offices. This initiative aims to raise awareness among girls about sanitation and hygiene while reducing absenteeism among female students. As part of its commitment to improving infrastructure in schools, Union Bank of India has also announced that it will construct more than 134 girls’ toilets across the country, with contributions from all regions. This initiative seeks to provide young girls with clean and safe sanitation facilities, ensuring their comfort and dignity. CSR of TVS Motor Company Srinivasan Services Trust (SST), the social arm of TVS Motor Company and Sundaram-Clayton Limited, has been working for women empowerment in the rural belts of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh for the past 27 years, through formation of Women Self-help groups, and helping them sustain through interventions in diverse sectors such as training, credit linkage, livelihood programmes and nudging them towards development of their community. SST has established a hygiene programme that focuses on menstrual health, benefiting over 1000 girl children annually, as per a recent announcement made by the trust. CSR of Flipkart – Project Udaan The Flipkart Foundation and Give Foundation in August 2023 announced partnered with Pinkishe Foundation, a non-profit organisation working towards improving the lives of women and girls in India, towards spreading awareness about menstrual health and hygiene. The initiative – ‘Project Udaan’ – aims to create period-positivity while addressing the challenges girls and women from marginalized communities face, especially in rural areas. By providing essential information and eco-friendly period products, the project endeavors to foster better reproductive health and behavioural practices. The project will be executed across multiple locations in four states, including Gandhinagar and Mehsana in Gujarat, Gurugram in Haryana, Bengaluru in Karnataka and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh. ‘This collaboration aims to empower and encourage adolescent girls and dismantle the taboo around periods. Besides promoting appropriate menstrual health practices, the project also envisions nurturing a sense of dignity and confidence among young girls and women. The programme seeks to cater to girls aged 10 to 18 years, benefiting 1,600 girls directly and an additional 3,200 girls and women indirectly, covering 20-25 schools identified with the help of local teams,’ as per a statement from the company. CSR of Amrutanjan Health Care Limited On the occasion of International Women’s Day in March this year, Amrutanjan Health Care Limited launched a campaign #PowerToBeYou to address the critical issue of period poverty in India and to spread the message that every woman has the right to manage her periods with dignity and confidence. Menstrual hygiene brand Amrutanjan Comfy, under its Project Disha, this year, has reached out to 10 states, 900 towns, 400 schools, 4.8 Lakh students and 100 Anganwadi centers across India to create awareness around menstrual hygiene and dismantle the barriers that hinder access to essential menstrual hygiene products, as per an announcement. #PowerToBeYou aims to transform communities by empowering women with access to affordable and high-quality menstrual hygiene products. CSR of Aditya Birla Group – Ujaas Aditya Birla Education Trust’s social initiative, Ujaas, is working towards creating awareness about menstrual health and hygiene in India. Founded by Advaitesha Birla, Ujaas has been actively engaged in driving awareness in the menstrual health space. “To date, we have reached out to over 254,654 girls through 8,516 educational sessions on menstrual health. Furthermore, we have distributed over 4,349,652 sanitary pads free to girls in rural Maharashtra across 1,228 schools in 17 districts,” as per a statement issued on 28 th May 2024. In addition to these efforts, Ujaas launched its Menstrual Health Express initiative in February this year. The Ujaas Van has started traveling across 25 states and 107 cities, conducting informative menstrual health workshops in partnership with local NGOs. The aim was to dismantle menstrual taboos and promote hygiene. Over 250,000 free pads were distributed to local communities where access to hygienic products was limited. Moreover, Ujaas has launched a Self-Help Groups (SHGs) program and a manufacturing unit for sustainable cloth pads. This initiative not only provides access to cloth pads in rural markets but also creates livelihood opportunities for 25 SHG women in the first phase. CSR of PNB Housing Finance PNB Housing Finance has undertaken a mission to create awareness and train rural women about the importance of menstrual hygiene. A program on menstrual hygiene management (MHM) was inaugurated on 19 January 2023 under which the Company, in association with the Desai Foundation, has set up a sanitary napkin production unit at Sitapur Road in Lucknow. PNB Housing Finance’s CSR arm, the Pehel Foundation, has taken this initiative to eliminate a key barrier to girls’ education and women’s participation in the workforce. The programme aims to increase awareness about menstrual hygiene among rural women and provide them with easy access to quality and affordable sanitary napkins. A three-pronged approach, i.e., creating awareness, establishing a local production unit, and building a robust distribution network of female sales representatives, will help foster a sustainable ecosystem and boost their financial empowerment. While this programme aims to help provide livelihood opportunities to rural women, the company is confident that the direct distribution model will increase access to menstrual hygiene, which can prove to be a catalyst for change in the entire community. CSR of PepsiCo With a focus on three priority campaigns of Government of India – the Jal Jeevan Mission, Jal Shakti Mission and Swachh Bharat Mission – the PepsiCo Foundation announced in March 2023 that it will invest USD 400,000 in partnership with Pandit Jagat Ram Memorial FORCE Trust to expand its safe water access and sustainable sanitation program in Uttar Pradesh. As part of the program, the PepsiCo Foundation and Pandit Jagat Ram Memorial FORCE Trust will help provide improved access to fresh water for drinking and domestic purposes, impacting more than 20,000 people and 3,000 children across 13 villages in Mathura district over a period of three years. The partnership will also create WASH awareness (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) focusing on sanitation, solid waste management, and hygiene practices with water quality, safety and personal health behaviors impacting 50,000 people and 3000 children. As part of the WASH efforts, the program will identify 400 women and girls as Menstrual Hygiene Management Guides and 400 youth as WASH Guardians to create a strong support ecosystem in their communities. CSR of o9 Solutions – o9 Solutions, a leading enterprise AI software platform provider is working to ensure the enhanced sanitation and hygiene of the women of the Sathyamangalam community in Tamil Nadu. The company also funded a menstrual health project under which the women of the same tribal community are trained to manufacture low-cost sanitary pads. In collaboration with Read India team, o9 will help them connect them with marketplaces and assist them in selling the product in and around the communities, announced the company. The girls’ students at the school will get free sanitary pads. This would improve the overall condition of hygiene among women in the community. Several awareness programs are planned to be conducted by the resource persons and the employees of o9 to raise the awareness level of girls and women in the community."

    "article_content": "There is a severe dearth of healthcare facilities in rural India. Despite accounting for more than 68% of the population, only about 3% of healthcare professionals practice there. To solve this, Rural Health Care Foundation (RHCF) has been running out-patient primary medical care centres in areas of West Bengal deprived of proper healthcare facilities within 50km radius. They have 12 rural centres in different districts of West Bengal. They also run 5 urban centres in Kolkata. The centres offer high-quality and low-cost medical care to communities. The rural centres, equipped with General Medicine, Optometry, Dentistry and Homeopathy departments and a pharmacy with over 200 kinds of generic medications, provides medical consultation at Rs. 80 and a 1-week supply of medication for free. Subsidized spectacles, free cataract and pterygium surgeries (in collaboration with Rotary) are also provided. Located in areas connected with proper transportation, the centres run 6 days a week. The non-medical support staffs at the centres are hired from within the communities, which help in building the trust with patients. The organization itself has methodical and organized operations to continue their mission. They follow a service delivery model that is scalable, replicable and also allows strive for sustainability, thus reducing dependency on donors. At present, a total of 5000 patients in a month can make a centre financially self-sustainable. From efficient utilization of funds (e.g. limiting administration expenses to 10% of project cost) to the procurement of generic medications to lower overall expenses, RHCF has strategies in place to help them further. Established in 2009, the organization has treated over 2.2 million patients to date.

    "article_content": "Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13) is one of the 17 goals established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The goal aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Climate change is a global problem that threatens the very survival of our planet and requires immediate action from all stakeholders. The world has already witnessed the devastating effects of climate change, including extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and increased frequency of natural disasters. These effects have not only led to a loss of life but have also had severe economic and social consequences. In this context, achieving SDG 13 is crucial to ensure a sustainable future for all. India, one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The country’s diverse geography and large population make it particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change. India is already experiencing the effects of climate change, including more frequent heatwaves, droughts, and floods. These impacts are expected to worsen in the future, with rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns leading to reduced agricultural productivity, water scarcity, and increased health risks. Given these challenges, it is imperative that India takes proactive measures to mitigate climate change and its impacts. In recent years, the Indian government has taken several steps towards achieving SDG 13, including the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency policies, as well as efforts to promote sustainable transportation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, achieving SDG 13 requires a collective effort from all stakeholders, including businesses, governments, and civil society. Investing in Renewable Energy One of the most effective ways to combat climate change is by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and gas, releases large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat and contribute to global warming. Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower can provide a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. They are clean, abundant and do not produce harmful emissions that contribute to climate change. In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards renewable energy investments in India, with both the government and private sector taking proactive measures towards promoting renewable energy. Many companies in India have already started investing in renewable energy as part of their CSR initiatives. They are recognising the role they can play in mitigating climate change and promoting sustainability through investing in renewable energy. By investing in renewable energy, companies can not only reduce their carbon footprint but also contribute to the country’s sustainable energy transition. Tata Power is one of the largest power companies in India, with a presence in over 35 countries. The company has committed to generating 30-40% of its total energy output from renewable sources by 2025. It has already installed over 2.7 GW of renewable energy capacity, including wind, solar, and hydro power. The company is also working towards developing energy storage solutions to enhance the integration of renewable energy into the grid. Infosys is a global leader in technology consulting, with a strong focus on sustainability. The company has installed solar panels on the rooftops of its buildings, resulting in a reduction of 6,000 tons of carbon emissions annually. It has also implemented energy efficiency measures, such as LED lighting and efficient air conditioning systems, to reduce its energy consumption. Infosys is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2040 and has set a target of sourcing 50% of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2025. Promoting Energy Efficiency Promoting energy efficiency is an essential step towards sustainable development and combating climate change. In India, many companies have recognised the need to adopt energy-efficient measures to reduce their carbon footprint and improve their overall operational efficiency. One such company is Mahindra & Mahindra, which has been a pioneer in the adoption of sustainable practices. Mahindra & Mahindra has implemented various energy efficiency initiatives at its manufacturing facilities to reduce its energy consumption per vehicle produced. The company has invested in new technologies, such as energy-efficient lighting, process optimisation, and improved thermal insulation, to reduce its energy consumption. Additionally, the company has set up energy management systems to monitor and control its energy usage, enabling it to identify areas for further improvement. In 2020, Mahindra & Mahindra was awarded the prestigious CII Energy Management Excellence Award for its energy conservation efforts. The company was recognised for its innovative approach to energy management, which includes the use of renewable energy, process optimisation, and employee engagement initiatives. Apart from Mahindra & Mahindra, other companies in India have also implemented energy efficiency measures as part of their CSR initiatives. For instance, Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), one of India’s largest fast-moving consumer goods companies, has implemented several energy-efficient measures, such as the installation of energy-efficient lighting and the use of renewable energy sources at its manufacturing facilities. As a result of these initiatives, HUL has been able to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 16% since 2010. Encouraging Sustainable Transportation Encouraging sustainable transportation is a crucial aspect of combating climate change. The transportation sector is one of the leading contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for nearly one-quarter of global emissions. Therefore, companies must prioritise sustainable transportation as part of their CSR initiatives to help achieve SDG 13. One effective way to promote sustainable transportation is by implementing carpooling programs. By encouraging employees to share rides, companies can significantly reduce their carbon footprint and promote a culture of sustainability. Wipro, a global leader in IT services, has implemented a successful carpooling program for its employees, resulting in a reduction of 3,200 tons of carbon emissions annually. The company has also installed electric vehicle charging stations at its campuses to encourage the use of electric vehicles. In addition to carpooling programs, companies can also provide electric or hybrid vehicles to their employees. For example, Infosys, a global technology consulting company, has replaced its entire fleet of diesel vehicles with electric cars. As a result, the company has reduced its carbon footprint by 60% and saved approximately 13 million litres of diesel since 2018. Companies can also promote the use of public transportation as part of their CSR initiatives. For example, Google India has partnered with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to provide real-time information about the metro system to its users. This initiative has encouraged more people to use public transportation, resulting in a reduction in the number of cars on the road and a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, companies can incentivise sustainable transportation by offering benefits such as free or subsidised public transportation passes, electric vehicle charging stations, and preferred parking for carpoolers or electric vehicle users. Promoting Sustainable Agriculture Agriculture is a sector that contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), agriculture, forestry, and other land use account for 23% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, promoting sustainable agriculture is an essential aspect of combatting climate change, and companies must prioritise sustainable agriculture as part of their CSR initiatives to help achieve SDG 13. Sustainable agriculture practices such as organic farming, crop rotation, and conservation tillage can help reduce emissions and promote climate resilience. Companies in India can invest in sustainable agriculture practices to promote climate-resilient agriculture and reduce their carbon footprint. For example, ITC Limited, a leading Indian conglomerate, has implemented sustainable agriculture practices across 550,000 acres of farmland, resulting in a reduction of 1.2 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually. The company’s sustainable agriculture practices include using organic manure, improving soil health through soil testing, and implementing efficient water management practices. In addition to ITC Limited, many other companies in India are investing in sustainable agriculture as part of their CSR initiatives. For instance, PepsiCo India has launched a program called ‘Sustainable Farming Initiative’ to promote sustainable agriculture practices among its contract farmers. The program has helped farmers adopt sustainable agriculture practices such as drip irrigation, laser land levelling, and integrated pest management. Similarly, Tata Chemicals, a leading chemical and fertilisers company in India, has developed a sustainable agriculture program called ‘Pragati’ to promote sustainable agriculture practices and improve farmers’ livelihoods. Moreover, companies can promote sustainable agriculture practices by providing financial and technical assistance to farmers. For instance, Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), a leading consumer goods company in India, has launched a program called ‘Project Shakti’ to empower rural women by providing them with training and resources to become entrepreneurs. Under this program, HUL has also provided financial and technical assistance to women farmers to adopt sustainable agriculture practices. Supporting Reforestation Supporting reforestation is an effective way for companies to contribute towards mitigating climate change. Reforestation involves planting trees in areas where forests have been depleted or destroyed. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Reforestation also promotes biodiversity and helps to prevent soil erosion. Several companies in India have initiated reforestation efforts as part of their CSR initiatives. For example, JSW Group, a leading Indian conglomerate, has launched the “Sakhi Van” project, which aims to plant one million trees across India. The project employs women from local communities to plant and maintain the trees, providing them with employment opportunities while also contributing to reforestation efforts. Similarly, Aditya Birla Group, one of India’s largest conglomerates, has planted over one million trees in 13 states in India as part of its CSR initiatives. In addition to afforestation programs, companies can also support forest conservation initiatives. Forest conservation involves protecting existing forests from degradation and deforestation. Companies can support forest conservation by partnering with NGOs and government agencies working to protect forests, investing in forest restoration projects, and implementing sustainable forestry practices. Tata Steel, a subsidiary of the Tata group, has partnered with the Forest Department of Jharkhand, a state in eastern India, to implement a program to protect forests from degradation and deforestation. The program involves planting trees, building check dams to prevent soil erosion, and promoting sustainable forestry practices. Implementing sustainable forestry practices is also essential for mitigating climate change. Sustainable forestry practices involve managing forests in a way that promotes the long-term health and productivity of the forest while minimising negative environmental impacts. Companies can implement sustainable forestry practices by using certified sustainable wood products, supporting forest certification programs, and implementing responsible sourcing policies. Promoting Sustainable Waste Management In India, waste management has become a significant challenge due to the country’s rapidly growing population and urbanisation. According to a report by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), India generates around 62 million tons of waste annually, and this is expected to double by 2030. However, only 70-80% of the waste is collected, and less than 30% is treated, leading to severe environmental and health impacts. Companies can play a significant role in promoting sustainable waste management practices by adopting the “reduce, reuse, and recycle” approach. By reducing the amount of waste generated and promoting the reuse of products and materials, companies can significantly reduce their carbon footprint. Additionally, by recycling waste materials such as paper, plastic, and metals, companies can reduce the demand for virgin materials, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with their extraction and production. Several companies in India have implemented sustainable waste management practices as part of their CSR initiatives. For example, Coca-Cola India has implemented a comprehensive waste management program that includes a recycling initiative and a composting program for its waste. The company has also partnered with local NGOs and waste collectors to collect and recycle plastic waste from communities. Similarly, ITC Limited has implemented a solid waste management program that involves recycling waste and converting it into compost. The company has also set up a biogas plant that converts organic waste into energy, reducing its carbon footprint and contributing to the achievement of SDG 13. Another example is Tata Steel, which has implemented a waste management program that includes the use of eco-friendly technology and the recycling of waste materials. The company has also implemented a zero-waste-to-landfill policy, which involves diverting all waste from landfills and finding alternative uses for it. In addition to reducing waste generation and promoting recycling, companies can also contribute to sustainable waste management by promoting composting. Composting is a process that involves the breakdown of organic waste into nutrient-rich compost that can be used as fertiliser. By promoting composting, companies can reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and contribute to the development of sustainable agriculture. For example, Infosys has implemented a composting program at its campus in Bangalore, where it converts food waste into compost that is used in the company’s gardens and landscaping. The program has resulted in a reduction of 4,200 tons of waste sent to landfills annually. Educating and Engaging Stakeholders In addition to implementing sustainable practices, companies can also play an essential role in educating and engaging their stakeholders about climate change and sustainability. By raising awareness about climate change, companies can inspire individuals to take action and contribute to the fight against climate change. Moreover, companies can use their influence to promote sustainable practices among their employees, customers, and suppliers. One example of a company that is taking an active role in educating and engaging stakeholders is Mahindra & Mahindra. The company has launched a sustainability program called “Rise for Good,” which aims to raise awareness about sustainability among its stakeholders. The program focuses on four key areas: sustainable livelihood, education, health, and environment. Under the environment pillar, Mahindra & Mahindra has implemented several initiatives to promote sustainability and raise awareness about climate change. For instance, the company has launched an eco-driving program that aims to promote fuel-efficient driving among its employees. The program provides training on fuel-efficient driving techniques and rewards employees who achieve high fuel efficiency. Moreover, Mahindra & Mahindra has implemented several initiatives to promote sustainable transportation among its stakeholders. The company has launched an electric vehicle (EV) initiative that aims to promote the adoption of EVs in India. As part of the initiative, Mahindra & Mahindra has launched several electric vehicles and is working to develop charging infrastructure for EVs. In addition to educating and engaging its stakeholders, Mahindra & Mahindra has also taken steps to reduce its carbon footprint. The company has implemented several energy efficiency initiatives at its manufacturing facilities, resulting in a 19% reduction in energy consumption per vehicle produced. Moreover, Mahindra & Mahindra has implemented sustainable agriculture practices across its farmland, resulting in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, by educating and engaging stakeholders, companies can play a critical role in achieving SDG 13. By raising awareness about sustainability and promoting sustainable practices, companies can inspire individuals to take action and contribute to the fight against climate change. Furthermore, by implementing sustainable practices themselves, companies can lead by example and encourage others to follow suit. In conclusion, SDG 13 calls for urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and corporate philanthropy can be powerful tools for achieving this goal in India. By investing in renewable energy, promoting energy efficiency, encouraging sustainable transportation, supporting sustainable agriculture and reforestation, promoting sustainable waste management, and educating and engaging stakeholders, companies can contribute to mitigating climate change and promoting sustainability. However, it is crucial that companies prioritise sustainability and view it as a long-term investment rather than a short-term cost. Ultimately, achieving SDG 13 will require a collective effort from governments, businesses, and civil society."

    "article_content": "A Mumbaikar loses 121 hours in traffic every year. A Delhite spends 110. Talking about traffic to a person living in Bengaluru is like touching a raw nerve. This is the same story for all the urban dwellers in the world. Traffic congestions are a major source of frustration for so many people in the world. In addition to this, they are also a cause of noise pollution, air pollution, fuel wastage, and carbon emissions. Research has shown that pollution at intersections is 29 times more than open roads. Most of it is caused because of slowing and then abrupt accelerating of vehicles. While it is impossible to completely eliminate stop and go at intersections, the traffic at intersections can be optimised significantly with use of technology. With an aim to do that, Google has deployed the use of Artificial Intelligence for improving efficiency of traffic light timings and configurations through Project Green Light. What is Project Green Light? Project Green Light is aimed at optimising the traffic light timings in a way to avoid or reduce congestions, thus reducing the stop and go instances at intersections. It makes use of Google AI and Google Maps driving trends with some of the strongest understandings of global road networks. Using this, it creates models of traffic patterns and build intelligent recommendations for city traffic engineers to make traffic flow more efficient. Early evaluations have indicated that there is a potential of reduction in stops by up to 30%, along with 10% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Through this method Google has claimed that it is possible to optimise each intersection and coordinate between adjacent intersections to create waves of green lights to further reduce stop and go traffic in the cities. Project Green Light is now live in 70 intersections in 12 cities, 4 continents, from Haifa, Israel to Bangalore, India to Hamburg, Germany. This has allowed in lowering of emissions and fuel wastage for up to 30 million car rides every month. Vineet Kumar Goyal, Commissioner of Police, Kolkata has said, “Green Light has become an essential component of Kolkata Traffic Police. It serves several valuable purposes which contribute to safer, more efficient, and organized traffic flow and has helped us to reduce gridlock at busy intersections. Since November 2022, we have implemented suggestions at 13 intersections. The outcome is excellent as per the feedback from commuters and traffic personnel.” Conclusion Artificial Intelligence has been so far viewed as a villain that can cost millions of people their jobs. However, when deployed effectively, it can not only solve problems that were otherwise too complicated to solve manually, but also do it in an affordable manner."

    "article_content": "Climate change is not just a concern for the environment that we live in, but also poses a major threat to human life and economy of the world as revealed by new studies and reports. A recent study published has revealed that the world will lose 19 per cent of its income by 2050 because of extreme weather events caused by climate change. In fact, a report by UK-based NGO Christian Aid has claimed that climate change related weather events have cost the world at least $41 billion since COP 28. Economic Impacts of Climate Change According to a recent study conducted by researchers from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impacts Research that is published in the journal Nature , the global economy is predicted to lose about 19 percent of its income as a result of climate change related events. India will be among the worst hit nations which is expected to suffer a loss of about 22 percent of its income by 2050 which would amount to around $38 trillion. This is true even if the efforts are made to significantly reduce carbon emissions starting immediately. Scientist and one of the study’s authors, Maximilian Kotz, has stated that loss of income will affect a large amount of population residing across North America, Europe, South Asia and Africa. The losses will occur as a result of effects of climate change on agriculture productivity, economic productivity of labour, and loss of infrastructure caused due to extreme weather events. These losses are much higher than the cost of limiting global warming to two degrees. These findings are based on the trends observed over the last four decades across 1600 regions. The study has claimed that significant economic losses will be observed over the next 25 years across the globe including the developed nations such as Germany, France and the United States of America, laying the blame on historical emissions caused for rapid and unsustainable development. The study has also clarified that if efforts are not made immediately to reduce the emissions, the losses could increase to 60 per cent by 2100. International Response The international community has been working towards reducing the effects of climate change by discussing solutions at COP conducted annually and working on agreements such as the new loss and damage fund set up during COP 28 organised in Dubai. However, there is still a major gap in action that needs to be filled with energy transition and elimination of usage of fossil fuels. Additionally support needs to be extended to vulnerable nations, that are at most risk of extreme weather related events. The report by the UK-based NGO, Christian Aid has asked the developed countries to provide enhanced financial support to meet the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) for climate finance that is to be in the agenda of discussion at the upcoming COP 29 in Baku, Azerbaijan. Conclusion Climate change is not only an academic discussion. It is not something that might affect someone sometime in future. It is here and it is causing loss of lives, resources and economy. It is beyond high time we take coordinated action, to prevent further damage rather than accrue resources to control the situation after the disaster."

    "article_content": "Recent heatwave in India has claimed lives of over 80 people, and over 25,000 people suffered from a heatstroke. The temperatures touched close to 50 in so many areas. Despite these harsh conditions, there were several people who had to do hard labour to earn a living. It is a difficult choice millions of daily wage labourers face every year in India during extreme weather events – either to stay home and not being able to afford food and medicines, or to work and put their life in jeopardy. More often than not, they choose the latter, and end up facing life threatening conditions to secure meals, education and medicines for them and their families. During the recent heatwave, around 46,000 women across 22 districts in India were able to make a third choice. They were able to stop working for a few hours daily, thanks to the parametric insurance program they were enrolled in. What is Parametric Insurance? Parametric insurance is a type of insurance that pays out when a certain pre-defined metric is hit, for example, a fixed high temperature. This is different from a regular insurance in the way that rather than assessing the loss incurred because of the event, the insurance pays out the agreed upon amount at the occurrence of the event. The company verifies the occurrence of the event using third party data, and once the verification is done, the person covered is eligible for a prompt payout without going through a tedious claim process. During the recent heatwave, about 50,000 women were enrolled under parametric insurance program by ICICI Lombard Insurance. Among these women, about 46,000 women received a total of $340,000 in payouts in the month of may, allowing them to be cautious about their health, while still being able to afford daily necessities. The Self-Employed Women’s Association labour union runs this insurance program. The premium for this program is paid for partly by the women enrolled in the program, and Climate Resilience for All, a non-profit, covering the remaining portion. The pilot program launched last year and is set to run until April 2025. Climate Resilience for All, is supporting this program through development, technical expertise and funding. Kathy Baughman McLeod, chief executive officer of Climate Resilience for All, has claimed that the program is successful and it plans to continue for a few more years. The organisation aims to ultimately sign up 2.9 million members of SEWA to the program, which would allow the plan to be funded entirely by women paying the premiums. “Our experience is that poor women don’t want charity always,” said Reema Nanavaty, general secretary of SEWA. “Once they see that this program is addressing their dire needs, I’m sure the women would start contributing toward the program.” The eventual plan would see the premium for each woman be about a day’s wage every month, she added. Talking about the impact of the program, Ms. Nanavaty said, “The biggest value the insurance payment gives them is dignity and self-respect.” SEWA and Climate Resilience for All teams recognise that insurance cannot solve all the problems, which is why they are also running other campaigns to educate the women on different ways in which they can protect themselves from extreme heat."

    "article_content": "According to official reports, the Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has sent a proposal to the government asking to amend the corporate social responsibility (CSR) provisions under Company’s Act, to include donations made by companies through Social Stock Exchanges. Social Stock Exchanges (SSE) are a segment under stock exchanges where non-profit organisations that are working for social welfare can register themselves and raise funds after being listed. The concept of Social Stock Exchanges was first proposed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her FY20 budget speech. Both BSE and NSE run social stock exchanges. Current CSR Law Currently, under the Company’s Act, the companies are required to spend 2 per cent of their average net profit over the last three years for CSR initiatives that are listed in the act. The non-profits listed under Social Stock Exchange work for the same causes as listed in the Company’s Act. Even so, if the companies want to extend their support to these organisations under CSR, they can do so by making financial contributions directly to the organisation, but cannot do so through SSE. The amendments to the Company’s Act as proposed by SEBI will allow companies to utilise the funds allocated for CSR to support organisations through SSE. According to SEBI, the minimum donation that can be made through SSEs is Rs. 50 lakh. Purpose of SSEs Social Stock Exchanges provide credibility to a non-profit organisation. It acts as a bridge of trust between a donor and recipient. This is because all the enterprises that are listed on an SSE are required to file a social impact report. This is an accountability measure which is supposed to be audited by a company secretary, cost accountants, or a chartered accountant (CA). The report must include details of activities of the organisation for the benefit of its donors. The first such report is set to be published in December 2024. R Balasubramaniam, chairperson of Sebi’s special advisory committee on SSEs said at a seminar on SSEs in New Delhi organized by the National Stock Exchange, “The time is not far when donors will ask whether a non-profit organization is registered with a social stock exchange before moving funds.” Donors can help the organisation listed under SSE by investing in Zero Coupon Zero Principal (ZCZP) securities. This is a unique asset that appears in a donor’s demat (dematerialisation) account, but does not yield any profits. The main purpose behind introduction of SSEs was to provide information to potential donors about legitimate institutions for philanthropic donations. The principle of SSEs is to not provide financial returns, but instead focus on social returns – welfare of society, as per Sebi."

    "article_content": "Adani Group has committed to invest more than $100 billion in green energy projects to accelerate energy transition, and in enhancing manufacturing capacity to produce all the major components required for generation of green energy. In order to achieve this, the conglomerate, apart from building solar parks and wind farms, is also building major facilities to manufacture electrolysers for making green hydrogen, wind power turbines and solar panels. Green hydrogen is made by splitting hydrogen from water with the help of electrolysers powered by clean energy. This is seen as a potential panacea for decarbonising the industry as well as transportation. Gautam Adani, Chairman of Adani Group has asserted that energy transition and digital infrastructure are trillion-dollar opportunities which has a potential to transform India at a local as well as a global scale. He said, “The next decade will see us invest more than $100 billion in the energy transition space and further expand our integrated renewable energy value chain that today already spans the manufacturing of every major component required for green energy generation,” while speaking at ‘Infrastructure – the Catalyst for India’s Future’ event of Crisil. Adani highlighted that affordable green energy is needed by several sectors in order for them to become sustainable. And to enable this, the company is building the world’s largest single-site renewable energy park in Khavda village of Kutch district in Gujarat. This renewable energy park will generate 30 GW power, which will take the total renewable energy capacity of Adani Group to 50 GW by 2030. Adani believes that energy transition will fundamentally change the global energy landscape. He said, “The global transition market was valued at approximately $3 trillion in 2023 and is expected to grow to nearly $6 trillion by 2030, and thereafter double every 10 years till 2050.” “As many of you know, in the case of India, our country aims to install 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030. This ambitious target will require annual investments of over $150 billion dollars. The transition to green energy in India is expected to generate millions of new jobs in sectors such as solar and wind, energy storage, hydrogen and its derivatives, EV charging stations, as well as grid infrastructure development,” he added. Digital Infrastructure On digital infrastructure, Adani remarked that data is the new oil. This makes Data Centre the heart of all the action, as there is an increasing need for ability to process data at an unprecedented speed and scale. However, this will require massive amounts of energy making data centre business among the highest consumers of energy in the world. “This makes the energy transition even more complex and is raising electricity prices, thereby adding to the already high prices because of the combined impact of climate change and demand growth,” Adani said. Gautam Adani said, the infrastructure required for energy transition and the infrastructure required for digital transformation are now inseparable as the technology sector becomes the largest consumer of the precious green electrons. “In fact, it is anticipated that by the year 2030, the world will need 100 to 150 GW of additional green energy just for the AI data centres. We already have India’s largest order book for data centres and are now in discussions for additional gigawatt-scale green AI data centres which we are uniquely positioned to deliver,” he said."

    "article_content": "UNICEF has said that it is deeply concrened about the health and safety of babies and young children caused as a result of severe heatwave that has been engulfing several countries in South Asia. The rising temperatures, that is predicted to reach up to 47°C, pose significant risks to millions of children who are more vulnerable to heat-related illnesses. The Indian Meteorological Department and Pakistan’s Meteorological Department have issued warnings of extreme danger, prompting urgent measures to safeguard the young and vulnerable populations. Health Risks and Preventive Measures According to UNICEF, children are at an increased risk during extreme heat events because they cannot regulate their body temperatures as well as adults. This can cause health related issues such as dehydration, heat strokes, and other severe conditions like rapid heartbeat, cramps, confusion, and even coma. In addition to this, prolonged exposure to high temperatures can adversely affect children’s brain development, potentially causing long-term cognitive issues. In order to reduce and mitigate these risks, UNICEF has advised parents and caregivers to be vigilent about keeping children hydrated and cool. Experts have recommended use of simple measures such as using ice packs, fans, and spraying water, which can help lower body temperature. For older children, an effective strategy is cold water immersion. In addition to this, loose clothing and frequent checks for symptoms of heat stress, such as, excessive thirst, dry mouth, and dizziness, are extremely important. The organisation has urged parents to seek immediate medical attention if a child is exhibiting severe symptoms like high fever or rapid breathing. UNICEF also emphasizes the need for health workers to be equipped to identify and treat heat stress symptoms promptly. The organization has provided guidelines to help frontline workers, families, and caregivers recognize and respond to heat-related illnesses efficiently. These steps are vital, especially in regions like South Asia, where a significant percentage of children are exposed to extreme temperatures for extended periods each year. Broader Impact and Call to Action The implications of rising temperatures extend beyond immediate health concerns. For pregnant women, extreme heat can result in early contractions, preterm births, and even stillbirths. Premature babies are at higher risk of death, underscoring the urgent need for protective measures. South Asia has one of the highest percentages of children exposed to extreme temperatures, with a UNICEF analysis indicating that 76% of children under 18 in the region faced extreme high temperatures in 2020. Furthermore, 28% of these children were exposed to multiple heatwaves annually. UNICEF calls for a collective effort to protect children from the adverse effects of extreme heat. The organization’s BEAT the Heat campaign outlines critical steps: – Be Aware Recognize heat stress and take preventive measures. – Easily Identify Know the symptoms of heat-related illnesses. – Act Immediately Apply first-aid actions to mitigate heat stress. – Take to a Health Facility Ensure prompt medical attention for severe cases. These proactive steps are crucial in safeguarding children’s health and ensuring they remain safe during extreme weather conditions. The urgency of these measures is highlighted by recent events, such as the oppressive heatwave in Bangladesh that led to the closure of primary schools, affecting 30 million children. The 2021 Children’s Climate Risk Index (CCRI) by UNICEF identifies children in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan as being at ‘extremely high risk’ from climate change impacts. This underscores the necessity for immediate and sustained action to protect the most vulnerable from the escalating climate crisis."

    "article_content": "As per information from the e-vahan portal, Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, a total of 15,04,012 Electric Vehicles (EVs) have been registered in India in the last two years between the months of June and December. There has been no slow-down in the sale of electric vehicles in India during the previous two months, according to Minister of State for Heavy Industries, Krishan Pal Gurjar. The total number of Electric Vehicles registered in India in the last 2 Years for specified months have been mentioned in the following table: Steps taken by Govt of India to boost EV sale In order to increase the sale of EVs in the country, the Government of India has adopted the following measures: 1.Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India): In order to promote manufacturing and adoption of electric vehicle in India, the Government launched the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) Scheme in 2015 on pan India basis with an aim to reduce dependency on fossil fuel and to address issues of vehicular emissions. At present, Phase-II of FAME India Scheme is being implemented for a period of 5 years w.e.f. 01 st April, 2019 with a total budgetary support of Rs. 10,000 crores. This phase focusses on supporting electrification of public & shared transportation and aims to support, through subsidies, 7090 e-Buses, 5 lakh e-3 Wheelers, 55000 e-4 Wheeler Passenger Cars and 10 lakh e-2 Wheelers. In addition, creation of charging infrastructure is also supported to address range anxiety among users of electric vehicles. 2.Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Automobile and Auto Component Industry: The Government on 15 th September, 2021 approved the PLI Scheme for Automotive Sector with a budgetary outlay of Rs. 25,938 crores over a period of five years. The scheme provides incentives up to 18% for electric vehicles. 3.Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, ‘National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cells (ACC) Battery Storage’: The Government on 12 th May, 2021 approved PLI Scheme for manufacturing of ACC in thecountry with a budgetary outlay of Rs. 18,100 crore. The scheme envisages establishing a competitive ACC battery manufacturing set up in the country for 50 GWh. Additionally, 5GWh of niche ACC technologies is also covered under the Scheme. 4.GST on electric vehicles and chargers/charging stations for electric vehicles has been reduced to 5%. 5.The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways announced that battery-operated vehicles will be given green license plates and be exempted from permit requirements. 6.The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways issued a notification advising states to waive road tax on EVs, which in turn will help reduce the initial cost of EVs. EVs coming to India in 2024 Some of the EV cars to look forward to in 2024 in India include Tata Harrier EV, Tata Curvv EV and Tata Punch EV from Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki EVX, EV9 from Kia, Mahindra XUV.e8 – an electric SUV from Mahindra and Mahindra."

    "article_content": "Titan Company Ltd., in collaboration with Himmotthan Society, announced a significant milestone in their joint effort to bring sustainable water solutions to the Tehri district of Uttarakhand. Under this initiative, trenches and percolation pits have been constructed across 60 villages, offsetting 126 million litres of water from an annual water deficit of 359 million litres through community participation. This project has not only increased per capita water availability from 17 to 55 litres per day but also helped reduce drudgery of women and children on an average by 3 hours daily, resulting an improved quality of life. In response to the severe water crisis exacerbated by changing climatic conditions and the devastating Uttarakhand floods of 2013, Titan Company Ltd. partnered with Himmotthan, a Tata Trusts initiative, to solve these issues. Currently, Titan is supporting 60 villages in the Tehri district of Uttarakhand. One of the major components within the programme is “Water Next” – See Water through Climate Lens , which creates an ecosystem at the village level to gather insights of the natural resources present in the area, audit water and microclimate, and develop a water balance sheet of each village. Following this, the programme co-creates a matrix to address the water issues in a scientific and participatory manner. This is the first step towards creating Climate Resilient Himalayan Communities. Sharing his views, Mr. C K Venkataraman, Managing Director, Titan Company Limited, said, “India is currently facing one of the most severe water crises in its history, with millions of people struggling to access clean and reliable water sources. Recognizing this urgent need, Titan Company Ltd. has been committing to addressing these challenges head-on through strategic partnerships and sustainable practices. Our collaboration with Himmotthan in the Tehri district is a testament to this commitment. By rejuvenating their traditional water resources and developing a climate resilient ecosystem for Himalayan Communities, we’ve not only alleviated water scarcity but also empowered women and transformed lives. At Titan, we believe that sustainable development is not just about addressing immediate needs but about creating a foundation for sustained outcomes.” The initiative has had a profound impact on the daily lives of the women and children in these villages. With the reduced burden of water collection, women have been able to engage in meaningful employment, pursue education, and to be able to spend more time with their families. The increase in microclimate and soil moisture from 20% to 30% has also boosted crop production by enhancing the presence of pollinators, thus improving overall livelihoods. Mr. N E Sridhar, Chief Sustainability Officer, Titan Company Limited, emphasized the program’s impact on community resilience, stating, “The success of the Himmotthan Water Program demonstrates the incredible potential of integrating local knowledge with sustainable practices. By enabling the women of Tehri district to take charge of their Natural resources, and water is utmost, we’ve seen a ripple effect that extends to education, health, and economic stability. This project is a powerful reminder that sustainable solutions must be inclusive and community-driven to create enduring change.” To further illustrate the journey and success of the Himmotthan Water Program, Titan Company Ltd. has released a video on the occasion of World Environment Day that documents the transformation in Chamba village.

    "article_content": "World No Tobacco Day is observed on the 31st of May every year by the World Health Organization and public health champions around the globe. The purpose is to spread awareness against the harmful effects of tobacco on human health, including the deaths caused by tobacco consumption and addiction. World No Tobacco Day 2023 Theme This year’s theme is ‘We need food, not tobacco’. According to World Health Organization, the 2023 global campaign aims to raise awareness about alternative crop production and marketing opportunities for tobacco farmers and encourage them to grow sustainable, nutritious crops. It will also aim to expose the tobacco industry’s efforts to interfere with attempts to substitute tobacco growing with sustainable crops, thereby contributing to the global food crisis. Harmful effects on our body There are multiple ill-effects of tobacco on the human body, warns Dr Anirban Biswas, noted Pulmonologist from Bardhaman, West Bengal, India. A person smoking cigarette or tobacco in any other form or chewing tobacco is at a very high risk of falling prey to heart attack, cerebral stroke and gangrene of limbs. Tobacco consumption leads to respiratory diseases like COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), a common lung disease causing restricted airflow and breathing problems. Tobacco is also majorly responsible for several types of cancer of the lungs, oral cancer, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and kidney cancer. How tobacco affects pregnant women, elderly and children Tobacco has the deadliest effect on expecting mothers and may even lead to abortion, says the doctor. A pregnant woman consuming tobacco also negatively impacts the child in the womb and the baby is born with anomalies like cleft lip, less weight and several neurological problems. The doctor also warns about the deadly effects of passive smoking especially on the elderly people and children. To learn how smoking or any other form of tobacco consumption kills humans, watch this video:"

    "article_content": "देश के अन्य राज्यों की तुलना में महाराष्ट्र की राजनीति (Maharashtra Politics) में पिछले कई सालों से भूचाल चल रहा है। महाराष्ट्र की राजनीति में सत्ता पर काबिज होने के लिए नेताओं ने क्या-क्या गुल खिलाये है ये किसी से भी नहीं छुपा है। सत्ता हासिल करने के लिए रिसॉर्ट पॉलिटिक्स (Resort Politics) अपने चरम पर रही है। महाराष्ट्र सरकार (Maharashtra Government) के 5 साल पूरे होने आये लेकिन इन पांच सालों में महाराष्ट्र की जनता को सरकार की तरफ से राजनीतिक झटके ही मिले है। महाराष्ट्र की जनता ने अपने आखों से कई मुख्यमंत्री को बदलते हुए देखा है। साल 2014 में विधानसभा के चुनाव में महाराष्ट्र (Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha Election) में पहली बार गैर कांग्रेसी (Maharashtra Congress) यानी भारतीय जनता पार्टी की सरकार सत्ता में आई। कांग्रेस के वोटों में 30 फीसदी गिरावट हुई और विधायकों की संख्या में 50 फीसदी की कमी। साल 2014 में महाराष्ट्र में बीजेपी ने सरकार बनाई और पूरे पांच साल तक देवेंद्र फडणवीस (Maharashtra Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis) मुख्यमंत्री रहे। साल 2019 में एक बार फिर से बीजेपी महाराष्ट्र में सत्ता पर काबिज होने के लिए जनता के सामने आई और जनता के सामने तमाम वादों का पिटारा देवेंद्र फडणवीस ने खोल दिया। अपने मेनिफेस्टो (Maharashtra BJP Manifesto) में देवेंद्र फडणवीस इस बात का जिक्र करते हुए कहते हैं कि पिछले 5 सालों में अमित शाह और प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी के नेतृत्व में साल 2014 से लेकर साल 2019 के दरमियान महाराष्ट्र कई मामलों में देश की तुलना में नंबर वन बना। कई मामलों में अग्रसर तो कई में फिसड्डी है महाराष्ट्र देवेंद्र फडणवीस के दावों की मानें तो महाराष्ट्र अकेले इन्वेस्टमेंट (Investment in Maharashtra), रोजगार (Government Jobs in Maharashtra) इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर जैसे क्षेत्रों में देश की तुलना में महाराष्ट्र ने पहला क्रमांक हासिल कर महाराष्ट्र की जनता का मान बढ़ाया है। शिक्षा क्षेत्र में महाराष्ट्र 17 वे नंबर से हटकर एक नंबर पर आ गया। वही हेल्थ के मामले में छठे क्रमांक से हटकर पहले तीन क्रमांक में आ गया। खेती के क्षेत्र में भी बड़े पैमाने पर सुधार हुआ है। टेक्नोलॉजी में बहुत इनवेस्टमेंट हुआ है। देश की अर्थव्यवस्था 5 ट्रिलियन डॉलर इकोनॉमी (5 Trillion Economy) के नरेंद्र मोदी के सपने को साकार करने के लिए महाराष्ट्र भी अपना 20 फीसदी योगदान देगा और महाराष्ट्र की अर्थव्यवस्था एक ट्रिलियन डॉलर्स इकोनॉमी को ले जाने के लिए काम किया जा रहा है लेकिन ये सब सत्ता पर काबिज नेताओं के दावों पर आधारित है। देश के अन्य राज्यों की तुलना में महाराष्ट्र हमेशा से ही अग्रसर रहा है। लेकिन फिर भी महाराष्ट्र पर कई धब्बा लगता ही रहता है। किसान आत्महत्या, सूखाग्रस्त महाराष्ट्र (Drought in Maharashtra) जैसे कई मुद्दे है जहां महाराष्ट्र हमेशा कलंकित होता है। फिर जारी होगा इलेक्शन मेनिफेस्टो और खुलेगा वादों का पिटारा चुनावी माहौल है ऐसे में फिर से इलेक्शन मेनिफेस्टो (Maharashtra Election Report Card ) जारी होगा, बड़े बड़े वादे किये जायेंगे, नेताओं द्वारा कसमें खायी जाएंगी। पुराने वादे कितने पूरे हुए और कितने अधूरे हैं इसी की पड़ताल करने के लिए The CSR Journal ने एक स्पेशल मुहीम शुरू की है Election Report Card, इस ख़ास सीरीज में हम जानेंगे नेताओं के चुनावी वादों में कितना रहा हकीकत और कितना रहा फ़साना। महाराष्ट्र में लोकसभा की कुल 48 सीटें हैं। Loksabha Election 2024 में Maharashtra BJP राज्य में सबसे ज्यादा सीटों पर चुनाव लड़ेगी। ऐसे में आइये जानते हैं 2019 के संकल्प पत्र में क्या-क्या था? महाराष्ट्र सरकार (Maharashtra Election Report Card) उनमें से कितने वादे पूरे कर सकी और किन वादों में सरकार पर सवाल उठते हैं। Maharashtra Lokshaba Election 2024 किसान भाइयों के लिए महाराष्ट्र सरकार ने क्या किया है (Agriculture in Maharashtra) महाराष्ट्र में किसान ख़ुदकुशी (Farmers Suicide in Maharashtra) एक गंभीर समस्या है। महाराष्ट्र में किसान आत्महत्या सरकार के लिए किसी संकट से कम नहीं है। किसानों के आत्महत्या का मामला सरकार के गले की फांस बन गई है। विधानसभा में पेश किए गए रिपोर्ट के अनुसार राज्य में रोज 7 किसान किसी न किसी कारण आत्महत्या कर रहे हैं। हालांकि सरकार ने किसानों को आत्महत्या करने से रोकने के लिए कई सारे कदम उठाए हैं लेकिन उनके सारी योजनाएं धरी की धरी रह गई है। विदर्भ के अमरावती और संभाजीनगर विभाग में किसानों के आत्महत्या (Farmers Sucide) के सबसे ज्यादा मामले सामने आए हैं। साल 2023 जनवरी से अक्टूबर के बीच राज्य में 2,366 किसानों ने आत्महत्या की है। आत्महत्या के सबसे ज्यादा मामले अमरावती विभाग से आए हैं। यहां पर 951 किसानों ने आत्महत्या की है। इसके बाद छत्रपति संभाजीनगर विभाग में 877, नागपुर विभाग में 257, नासिक विभाग में 254 और पुणे मंडल में 27 किसानों ने खुदकुशी की है। आत्महत्या करने वाले किसान के परिवार को सरकार एक लाख रुपये की आर्थिक मदद हादसे के तत्काल बाद ही दे देती है। किसान मरते रहे, सरकार देखती रही मदद व पुनर्वसन मंत्री अनिल पाटील ने लिखित उत्तर में विधान सभा में कहा है कि किसान आत्महत्या (Farmers Suicide in Maharashtra) नहीं करे इसलिए लिए वसंतराव नाईक कृषि स्वावलंबन मिशन, कृषि समृद्धि योजना, महात्मा ज्योतिराव फुले किसान कर्ज मुक्ति योजना, एक रुपये वाली फसल बीमा योजना जैसी कई योजनाएं लागू कर सरकार मदद कर रही हैं। नमो किसान महा सम्मान योजना के तहत राज्य सरकार हर साल किसानों को 6,000 रुपये की मदद देती है। इसके अलावा बेमौसम बारिश, ओलावृष्टि, सूखा जैसी प्राकृतिक आपदा आने पर किसानों को अलग से मदद करती है। आत्महत्या करने वाले किसान के परिवार को एक लाख रुपये देते हैं ताकि परिवार को उस वक्त राहत मिल सके। इतने उपायों और योजनाओं के बाद भी देश की तुलना में सबसे ज्यादा किसान महाराष्ट्र में आत्महत्या करते है। (Maharashtra Government Schemes for Farmers) नहीं हुई किसानों की आय दोगुनी जहां केंद्र सरकार ने किसानों की आय (Farmers Income Double) को दोगुना करने का काम कर रही है इस बीच किसान की ख़ुदकुशी सरकार पर एक कलंक है। केंद्र सरकार की मोदी गवर्नमेंट ने किसानों की आय दोगुना करने के लिए 2022 का लक्ष्य रखा था, लेकिन साल 2024 हो गए हैं अभी तक किसानों की आय दोगुनी नहीं हुई है। देवेंद्र फडणवीस (DCM Devendra Fadnavis) ने साल 2019 के मेनिफेस्टो में इसका जिक्र करते हुए किसने की आय को दोगुना करने का जिक्र करते हुए किसान फसल बीमा योजना, प्रधानमंत्री किसान सम्मान निधि योजना, सस्ते दामों पर यूरिया की उपलब्धता, सॉइल हेल्थ कार्ड, सिंचाई, इनाम योजना जैसी विविध योजनाओं को गिनाया और महाराष्ट्र की राज्य सरकार ने लागू किया लेकिन फिर भी किसानों की आय डबल नहीं हुई। मिल रहा है केंद्र और राज्य सरकार से दोगुना किसान सम्मान निधि प्रधानमंत्री किसान सम्मान निधि (PM Kisan Samman Nidhi) और मुख्यमंत्री किसान सम्मान निधि ये दोनों केंद्र और राज्य सरकार की किसानों के लिए सम्मान निधि दिया जाता है। अभी हालही में देश के प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) यवतमाल के दौरे पर थे जहां महाराष्ट्र के किसानों को अलग से 3800 करोड़ रुपए ट्रांसफर हुए हैं। यानि महाराष्ट्र के किसानों को पीएम किसान सम्मान निधि के 12 हज़ार हर वर्ष मिल रहे हैं। पीएम किसान सम्मान निधि के तहत अभी तक देश के 11 करोड़ किसानों के खाते में 3 लाख करोड़ रुपए से अधिक जमा हो चुके हैं। इससे महाराष्ट्र के किसानों को 30 हज़ार करोड़ और यवतमाल के किसानों को 900 करोड़ रुपए मिलें है। ये पैसा छोटे किसानों के कितने काम आ रहा है। कुछ दिन पहले ही केंद्र सरकार ने गन्ने के लाभकारी मूल्य में रिकॉर्ड बढ़ोतरी की है। अब गन्ने का लाभकारी मूल्य 340 रुपए प्रति क्विंटल हो गया है। इससे महाराष्ट्र के करोड़ों गन्ना किसानों और खेत मजदूरों को लाभ हो रहा है। महाराष्ट्र के कई गांव सूखाग्रस्त, बूंद-बूंद पानी के लिए तरसते लोग विकसित भारत के लिए गांव की अर्थव्यवस्था का सशक्त होना बहुत ज़रूरी है। कहते है कि देश की आधी आबादी से ज्यादा लोग गांव में रहते है। गांव में रहने वाले हर परिवार की परेशानियों को दूर कर उन्हें आर्थिक संबल बनाने के प्रयास में महाराष्ट्र सरकार कहीं सफल तो ज्यादातर विफल नज़र आयी है। पानी का महत्व क्या होता है, ये विदर्भ और मराठवाड़ा (Vidarbha and Marathvada of Maharashtra) से बेहतर भला कौन जान सकता है। पीने का पानी हो या फिर सिंचाई का पानी विदर्भ और मराठवाड़ा के सूखाग्रस्त इलाके में हाहाकार रहता है। लेकिन अब कितना बदलाव आया है ये हर साल मीडिया रिपोर्ट में दिख ही जाता है। इन इलाकों में गरीब, दलित, पिछड़े और आदिवासी हमारी माताओं-बहनों के लिए जल संकट बहुत बड़ा संकट था। इस स्थिति से माताओं-बहनों को बाहर निकालने के लिए ही लाल किले से पीएम नरेंद्र मोदी (PM Narendra Modi) ने हर घर जल की गारंटी दी थी। लेकिन आज भी ग्रामीण परिवारों तक पाइप से पानी नहीं पहुंचा है। पीएम द्वारा दिए गए आकड़ों की माने महाराष्ट्र में भी जहां 50 लाख से कम परिवारों के पास ही नल से जल (Nal Jal Yojana) था, आज लगभग सवा करोड़ नल कनेक्शन हैं। लेकिन जहां महाराष्ट्र की कुल आबादी 15 करोड़ है और महज सवा करोड़ नल कनेक्शन हैं ऐसे में ये आकड़े कितने कारगर है इसका अंदाजा आप खुद ही लगा लीजिये। आर्थिक समृद्धि में महाराष्ट्र अग्रसर फिर भी इंडस्ट्रीज दूसरे राज्यों में जाने को मजबूर आर्थिक समृद्धि में महाराष्ट्र अग्रसर है। महाराष्ट्र में बड़े पैमाने पर देश विदेश की कंपनियां निवेश करती है। स्विट्जरलैंड के दावोस में हालही में वर्ल्ड इकोनॉमिक फोरम (World Economic Forum) में महाराष्ट्र का डंका बजा है। अकेले महाराष्ट्र में निवेश को लेकर 3 लाख 53 हजार 675 लाख करोड़ का रिकॉर्ड एमओयू हुआ है। इन समझौतों के जरिए राज्य में बड़ी संख्या में 2 लाख रोजगार (Employment in Maharashtra) पैदा होंगे। महाराष्ट्र भारत में सर्वाधिक जीडीपी वाला राज्य है। All India औसत हिस्सेदारी में महाराष्ट्र का नॉमिनल GDP 14% और उच्चतम एफडीआई 29% है। महाराष्ट्र सरकार भले इन उपलब्धियों को रखे लेकिन सच्चाई ये भी है कि अब महाराष्ट्र से ज्यादा निवेश उत्तर प्रदेश, गुजरात, तेलंगाना जैसे राज्यों में हो रहा है। इतना ही नहीं महाराष्ट्र से कई बड़ी परियोजनाओं दूसरे राज्यों में चली गयी। महाराष्ट्र की जगह दूसरे राज्यों को बड़ी परियोजनाएं मिलने के मुद्दे पर एकनाथ शिंदे-देवेंद्र फडणवीस की सरकार विपक्ष के निशाने पर भी रही है। सत्तारूढ़ सरकार राज्य में वेदांत-फॉक्सकॉन और टाटा-एयरबस परियोजनाओं को लाने में विफल रही। ये दोनों परियोजनाएं गुजरात के खाते में चली गईं। ऐसे में ऐसी क्या मज़बूरी है कि ये प्रोजेक्ट महाराष्ट्र का त्याग कर दूसरे राज्यों का रुख कर रहे है। (Investment in Maharashtra) महाराष्ट्र का इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर है सबसे ऊपर (Infrastructure Development in Maharashtra) इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर के मामले में महाराष्ट्र दूसरे राज्यों की तुलना में सबसे आगे है। मुंबई में मेट्रो का जाल बिछाना हो या एक्सप्रेस वे बनाना हो महाराष्ट्र दूसरे राज्यों के लिए नजीर रहा है। देश का पहला एक्सप्रेस वे मुंबई पुणे एक्सप्रेस वे बना, बांद्रा से वर्ली सी लिंक देश का पहला सी लिंक बना। मुंबई से नवी मुंबई सिर्फ 20 मिनट में अटल सेतु से पहुंचा जा सकता है। अभी हालही में पीएम मोदी ने मुंबई और इसके उपनगर नवी मुंबई को जोड़ने वाले देश के सबसे लंबे समुद्री पुल अटल सेतु का उद्घाटन किया। अटल सेतु ब्रिज ने मुंबई से नवी मुंबई तक आवागमन को बदल दिया है, जिससे यात्रा का समय 2 घंटे से घटकर 20 मिनट रह गया है। अटल सेतु ने न केवल यात्रा के समय को तेज कर दिया है, बल्कि प्रमुख शहरों के बीच कनेक्टिविटी में भी काफी सुधार किया है, जिससे क्षेत्रीय विकास को बढ़ावा मिला है। मुंबई नागपुर समृद्धि महामार्ग (Mumbai Nagpur Samruddhi Highway) भी महाराष्ट्र की समृद्धि में एक महामार्ग का काम कर रहा है। नागपुर-मुंबई समृद्धि महामार्ग मुंबई के लोग केवल 10 घंटे में नागपुर पहुंच सकेंगे जो शहर से लगभग 800 किलोमीटर दूर है। चुनावी मुद्दा होने के बावजूद, बदहाल है मुंबई गोवा का हाईवे (Mumbai Goa Highway) मुंबई-गोवा हाईवे की बदहाली से परेशान लोग लगातार आंदोलन करते रहते हैं। मुंबई गोवा का हाईवे इतना जर्जर है कि पिछले 10 वर्षों में 6 हजार करोड़ रुपए खर्च किए जा चुके हैं। लेकिन हाल फिलहाल बदहाल है। मुंबई-गोवा हाईवे का निर्माण पिछले 15 सालों से जारी है। लेकिन ये प्रोजेक्ट है कि खत्म होने का नाम ही नहीं ले रहा। डेढ़ दशक में अब तक इस हाईवे पर करीब 1500 से ज्यादा लोगों की जान चली गई। लेकिन अब महाराष्ट्र की शिंदे सरकार का दावा है कि इसका काम अगले महीने पूरा हो जाएगा। केंद्रीय मंत्री नितिन गडकरी ने भी इसकी जानकारी दी थी। बता दें कि मुंबई-गोवा हाईवे कोंकण में 66 पर्यटन स्थलों को जोड़ता है, लिहाजा इससे विकास को बहुत बढ़ावा मिलेगा। गौरतलब है कि इस सड़क का निर्माण कार्य साल 2011 में शुरू हो गया था। इस हाईवे के जरिए मुंबई से गोवा का सफर तय करने के मौजूदा समय में लगभग 6 घंटे कम हो जाएंगे। गड्ढा मुक्त मुंबई का सपना नहीं बन पता हकीकत मुंबई ही नहीं बल्कि महाराष्ट्र में जब भी बारिश आती है, सड़कों पर बहुत गड्ढे हो जाते है। अगर अकेले मुंबई की बात करें तो हर साल करोड़ों रुपये खर्च कर गड्ढे भरे जाते है लेकिन कुछ ही दिनों में फिर से सड़कों पर गड्ढे हो जाते है। गड्ढों को लेकर सीएम (Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde) ने दावा करते हुए कहा दो से ढाई साल में मुंबई गड्ढों से मुक्त हो जाएगी और सभी सड़कें पक्की हो जाएंगी। सीएम एकनाथ शिंदे ने कहा पहले हर बरसात के मौसम में तारकोल की सड़कें बनाई जाती थीं और लोगों को गड्ढों में यात्रा करने के लिए मजबूर होना पड़ता था। बीजेपी के मेनिफेस्टो रेलवे का जिक्र लेकिन मुंबईकरों को रेलवे से मिलती है सिर्फ असुविधा बीजेपी अपने मेनिफेस्टो में रेलवे इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर पर जिक्र करते हुए बहुत सी बातें लिखी है। बीजेपी के मेनिफेस्टो की माने तो केंद्र सरकार ने रेलवे पर बहुत फोकस किया है और बड़े पैमाने पर बदलाव कर रही है लेकिन ये धरातल पर नहीं है। एक एक करके महाराष्ट्र के रेलवे प्रोजेक्ट और रेलवे मुंबईकरों समेत महाराष्ट्र वासियों को कितनी सुविधाएं देती है इसकी पड़ताल करते है। बात करें बुलेट ट्रेन की तो मुंबई अहमदाबाद की तर्ज पर मुंबई नागपुर बुलेट ट्रेन (Bullet Train Latest News) लाया जायेगा। बीजेपी ने इसको लिए मेनिफेस्टो में जिक्र भी किया है। लेकिन सच्चाई यही है कि मुंबई से नागपुर के बीच प्रस्तावित बुलेट ट्रेन की अबतक सिर्फ डिटेल्ड प्रोजेक्ट रिपोर्ट (DPR) ही बनी है और आगे की कार्यवाही कुछ नहीं हुआ है। रही बात मुंबई अहमदाबाद बुलेट ट्रेन की तो हां जरूर यहां काम हुआ है। भारत के बुलेट ट्रेन प्रोजेक्ट (Bullet Train Project in India) के पहले फेज का काम तेजी से जारी है। इसमें 100 किमी का पुल तैयार हो चुका है। 250 किमी तक पिलर खड़े किए जा चुके हैं। देश की पहली बुलेट ट्रेन मुंबई से अहमदाबाद (Ahmedabad News) के बीच चलेगी। भीड़भाड़ है मुंबई की लोकल है तो सहूलियत देगी मुंबई की मेट्रो (Metro in Mumbai) मुंबईकर सबसे ज्यादा देश को टैक्स देते है, मुंबईकर सबसे ज्यादा रेलवे का टिकट ख़रीदते है। इन सब के बावजूद मुंबईकरों को यात्रा कैसे करनी पड़ती है ये बताने की जरुरत नहीं है। मुंबई की लाइफ लाइन आमची लोकल ट्रेन ना सिर्फ जानलेवा बनती जा रही है बल्कि इतनी भीड़, इतनी भीड़ होती है कि मुंबई की लोकल से यात्रा करना मतलब यात्रा के दौरान सरसो का दाना गिरा दो तो शायद वो भीड़ में ट्रेन की फर्श पर गिरे। लोकल की इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर को बढ़ाने और सुविधाजन यात्रा का हर बाद भरोसा दिया जाता है लेकिन कुछ ख़ास नहीं हो पाता। हां जरूर मुंबई में मेट्रो के जाल से आनेवाले दिनों में सहूलियतें होंगी। करीब छह दशक पहले मुंबई में आने-जाने के लिए ट्राम का इस्तेमाल होता था, यात्रियों की संख्या बढ़ने पर ट्राम की जगह बेस्ट की बसों ने ले ली। जब बसें कम पड़ने लगीं, तो लोकल ट्रेन मुंबई की लाइफ लाइन बन गईं। अब एमएमआर में 337 किमी लंबा मेट्रो का जाल बिछा कर सरकार लोगों को सफर का नया विकल्प उपलब्ध करवा रही है। महाराष्ट्र में शिक्षा पर जोर देने की बात में कितनी सच्चाई? (Education in Maharashtra) शिक्षा व्यवस्था, किसी समाज में चलने वाली एक सामाजिक प्रक्रिया है। शिक्षा की ही बदौलत हर एक व्यक्ति का विकास संभव होता है। शिक्षा की वजह से ही किसी भी व्यक्ति के ज्ञान, कला-कौशल में बढ़ोतरी होती है और व्यवहार में बदलाव आता है। शिक्षा की वजह से ही लोग सभ्य, सुसंस्कृत, और योग्य नागरिक बनते हैं। विद्यालय, अर्थात वो स्थान जहां देश का भविष्य आकार लेता है। जहां हमारी भावी पीढ़ियां यानी हमारे बच्चों के बेहतर भविष्य की नींव रखी जाती है। विद्यालय बच्चों के व्यक्तित्व के निर्माण का सबसे महत्वपूर्ण केन्द्र होते है ऐसे में सरकारी प्राथमिक एवं उच्च प्राथमिक विद्यालयों में मूलभूत सुविधाओं का बेहतर होना बहुत जरुरी है। सबसे पहले यहां ये बताना जरुरी हो जाता है कि बेसिक एजुकेशन सिस्टम में सरकारी प्राइमरी स्कूल का इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर कैसा है। वैसे तो महाराष्ट्र की सरकारी स्कूलों का इंफ़्रा बहुत क्लास लेवल का है ऐसा नहीं है। महाराष्ट्र के पहाड़ी इलाकों और दुर्गम क्षेत्रों में बच्चों के पढ़ाई की क्या हालत है ये खुद बच्चे और उनके अभिभावक जानते है। आजकल ई लर्निंग और ई क्लासेस का बहुत चलन है, सरकार ऑनलाइन पढ़ाई पर जोर भी दे रही है लेकिन बच्चों को ऑनलाइन पढ़ाई के लिए सरकार कितनी सुविधाएं दे रही है ये किसी से छुपा नहीं है। महाराष्ट्र में बीजेपी ने अपने मेनिफेस्टो में कई वादे किये है। स्कॉलरशिप यानी छात्रवृत्ति को लेकर बीजेपी ने एक विंडो प्रणाली लागू करने की बात तो कही थी लेकिन अभी तक वन विंडो सिस्टम शुरू नहीं किया गया है। हां ये जरूर है कि छात्रवृत्ति पाने के लिए ऑनलाइन प्रणाली है लेकिन इंटीग्रेटेड सभी स्कॉलरशिप (How to get Scholarship in Maharashtra) के लिए कोई एक सिस्टम नहीं है। ग्रामीण महाराष्ट्र से शहरी क्षेत्र में आने वाले विद्यार्थियों के लिए यातायात के अधिक और सुगम व्यवस्था का बीजेपी ने वादा किया था लेकिन अलग से ऐसी कोई प्रणाली लागू नहीं की गयी है जिससे विद्यार्थियों के लिए यातायात सुगम हो सके। मुंबई के सेंट्रल यूनिवर्सिटी की स्थापना का भी वादा था जो की अभी अधूरा है। पारम्परिक पढ़ाई के करिकुलम में खेती की पढ़ाई कराई जायेगा ऐसा भी वादा बीजेपी ने किया था लेकिन ये वादा भी अधूरा है। मराठवाड़ा, उत्तर महाराष्ट्र और कोंकण में आईआईटी, आईआईएम और एम्स स्थापना की बात कही गयी थी लेकिन बीजेपी का ये वादा भी अधूरा है। खेलो इंडिया (Khelo India) के स्तर पर खेलो महाराष्ट्र का भी आयोजन किया जायेगा लेकिन महाराष्ट्र सरकार ने अब तक नहीं किया है। कैसा है महाराष्ट्र का स्वास्थ्य (Health in Maharashtra) दूसरे राज्यों की तुलना में महाराष्ट्र की स्वास्थ्य व्यवस्था अच्छी है। महाराष्ट्र के मुख्यमंत्री एकनाथ शिंदे (Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde) और उपमुख्यमंत्री देवेंद्र फडणवीस हेल्थ सर्विसेस (Health services in Mumbai, Maharashtra) और हेल्थ इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर पर विशेष ध्यान देते है। महाराष्ट्र के हर जिले में सरकारी अस्पताल है और सुपर स्पेशलिटी हॉस्पिटल (List of the Super Speciality Hospital in Mumbai, Maharashtra) की बात करें तो डिवीजन स्तर पर तो एक अस्पताल जरूर मिल जायेगा। स्वास्थ्य को लेकर महाराष्ट्र में बहुत सारी योजनाएं चलायी जा रही है जिससे ना सिर्फ महाराष्ट्र के लोगों को इसका फायदा हो रहा है बल्कि दूसरे राज्यों से आये गरीब और जरूरतमंद मरीजों को भी हो रहा है। आम लोगों के इलाज के लिए महाराष्ट्र के मुख्यमंत्री एकनाथ शिंदे खुद मुख्यमंत्री सहायता निधि चलाते है। इस Medical Help Cell से मिलने वाली आर्थिक सहायता की राशि 2 लाख से बढ़ाकर 3 लाख रुपए भी कर दी गई है। लिवर ट्रांसप्लांट, बोन मैरो ट्रांसप्लांट, हॉर्ट ट्रांसप्लांट, कृत्रिम अंग लगाने व नवजात बालकों के आईसीयू में इलाज के लिए भी मुख्यमंत्री सहायता निधि से राशि उपलब्ध कराई जा रही है। 12 करोड़ लोगों को स्वास्थ्य बीमा देने के लिए दो योजनाएं मिलाई गईं, एक कार्ड से 5 लाख का इलाज मुफ्त मिलेगा महाराष्ट्र में स्वास्थ्य सेवा बेहतर करने और गरीब वर्ग तक इलाज की सुविधा पहुंचाने के लिए केंद्र और राज्य सरकारें कई जन कल्याणकारी योजनाएं चला रही हैं (Health Insurance Scheme of Maharashtra)। ऐसी ही स्वास्थ्य योजना आयुष्मान भारत (Ayushman Bharat Yojana) केंद्र की ओर से संचालित की जा रही है। स्वास्थ्य बीमा का लाभ देने वाली ज्योतिबा फुले आरोग्य योजना (Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana ) महाराष्ट्र सरकार चला रही है। अब इन दोनों योजनाओं को एक साथ मिलाकर यानी को-ब्रांड करके राज्य के लोगों को लाभ दिया जाएगा। आयुष्मान और ज्योतिबा फुले योजना का संयुक्त कार्ड बनेगा। आयुष्मान भारत योजना और ज्योतिबा फुले आरोग्य योजना को एक साथ को ब्रांड कर महाराष्ट्र राज्य में लागू करके प्रदेश में 12 करोड़ लोगों को आयुष्मान भारत योजना और ज्योतिबा फुले आरोग्य योजना का एक संयुक्त कार्ड बनाकर 5 लाख की स्वास्थ्य सुरक्षा देने का निर्णय लिया गया है। लेकिन सुपर स्पेशलिटी हॉस्पिटल को बढ़ाने को लेकर महाराष्ट्र सरकार जरूर कम पड़ी है। विकास में समान भागीदारी रखने वाली महाराष्ट्र की महिलाओं के सम्मान में महाराष्ट्र सरकार ने ये काम किये (Women Empowerment in MH) विकास में समान भागीदारी रखने वाली महाराष्ट्र की महिलाओं के सम्मान के लिए महाराष्ट्र सरकार ने पिछले 5 सालों में बहुत सारे इनिशिएटिव लिए हैं। चाहे माझी कन्या भाग्यश्री योजना हो या अस्मिता योजना, महिला बचत ग्रुप को 27000 से लगभग चार लाख लेकर आने का काम महाराष्ट्र सरकार ने किया है। एसिड अटैक से मिलने वाली सरकारी मदद में भी महाराष्ट्र सरकार ने बढ़ोतरी की है। एवं महिला सुरक्षा के लिए भी महाराष्ट्र सरकार ने कई उपाय योजनाओं पर काम किया है। बीजेपी के मेनिफेस्टो की जिक्र करें तो महाराष्ट्र में महिलाओं के लिए कई लुभावने वादे किए गए लेकिन उसमें उन वादों में कुछ हद तक सच्चाई रही और बहुत हद तक फसाना है। भाजपा द्वारा जारी मेनिफेस्टो के अनुसार महिलाओं की आर्थिक विकास में 50 फीसदी की भागीदारी होगी। लेकिन सच्चाई इससे परे है। महिला उद्योगों और महिला बचत गट को सुविधा देते हुए वूमेन एंपावरमेंट पर काम किया जाएगा। वीमेन एम्पावरमेंट पर काम तो महाराष्ट्र सरकार ने किया है लेकिन महिला सशक्तिकरण कितनी महिलाओं तक पहुंची है ये अकड़ा सरकार के पास भी नहीं है। महिलाओं के स्वास्थ्य के लिए ₹1 में सेनेटरी नैपकिन उपलब्ध करने की बात तो बीजेपी ने अपने मेनिफेस्टो में की है लेकिन मुंबई जैसे शहर और महाराष्ट्र के ग्रामीण में 1 रुपये में सेनेटरी नैपकिन कहां मिल रही है ये कोई नहीं बताने वाला है। शहर और ग्रामीण महाराष्ट्र में महिलाओं के लिए पर्याप्त संख्या में टॉयलेट्स (Women Toilets) बनाए जाएंगे ऐसी तो बातें मेनिफेस्टो में है लेकिन मुंबई में 1769 महिलाओं पर केवल एक टॉयलेट की व्यवस्था है। वहीं 696 पुरुषों पर एक टॉयलेट है। साल 2018 में यह देखा गया कि 4 सार्वजनिक शौचालयों में से सिर्फ 1 महिलाओं के लिए था। केंद्र सरकार द्वारा शुरू किए गए स्वच्छ भारत अभियान के तहत तय किए गए मानक 100-400 पुरुषों तथा 100-200 महिलाओं के लिए 1 शौचालय से बहुत कम है। नौकरी करने वाली महिलाओं के लिए प्रत्येक जिले में कम से कम एक हॉस्टल बनाया जाएगा ऐसी बात भी मेनिफेस्टो में कही गयी है लेकिन महाराष्ट्र के सभी जिलों में Womens Hostels in Maharashtra नहीं है और जहां है वहां लंबी वेटिंग है। महिला अत्याचारों के मामले को निस्तारण करने के लिए अतिरिक्त न्यायालय की स्थापना की जाएगी ऐसा भी वादा किया गया है लेकिन कोर्ट में इतने लंबित केसेस है ऐसे में महिलाओं की सुनवाई ही कहां हो पायेगी। समावेशी विकास और महाराष्ट्र (Inclusivity in MH) कब बनेंगे ये स्मारक भारतरत्न डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर स्मारक हर एक राज्य समाज के हर वर्ग को साथ लेकर चलना चाहती है, सभी वर्गों का समावेशी विकास करना चाहती है। भारतरत्न डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर (Latest Updates about Baba Saheb Ambedkar Smarak) को नमन करते हुए महाराष्ट्र सरकार ने मुंबई के इंदु मिल में भारतरत्न डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर का भव्य स्मारक बनाने का ऐलान किया था। बीजेपी ने इस भव्य स्मारक के उद्घाटन का साल 2022 रखा था लेकिन साल 2024 आ गया लेकिन अभी तक भारतरत्न डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर का भव्य स्मारक नहीं बन पाया है। भारतरत्न डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर विविधांगी व्यक्तिमत्व के धनी थे। वंचित और उपेक्षित समाज के लोगों को उनका न्याय एवं हक़ मिलें, इसके लिए वे दिन-रात लड़े। मुंबई शहर यह डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर की कर्म भूमि के रूप में पहचानी जाती है। यहीं पर ही उन्होंने शिक्षा हासिल की है और विश्व स्तर के नेतृत्व के रूप में वे यहीं से पहचाने जाने लगे। डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर का प्रेरणादायी कार्य नए पीढ़ी तक पहुंचाया जा सके, इसके लिए डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर का भव्य स्मारक बनाया जा रहा है। छत्रपति शिवाजी महाराज स्मारक महाराष्ट्र नवनिर्माण सेना के अध्यक्ष राज ठाकरे ने अभी हालही में कहा कि मुंबई के पास अरब सागर में छत्रपति शिवाजी महाराज (Latest Updates about Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Smarak) का प्रस्तावित भव्य स्मारक बनाना मुश्किल और बेहद महंगा होगा। बीजेपी ने अपने मेनिफेस्टो में स्मारक का जल्द निर्माण करने की बात लिखी है। हम आपको बता दें कि स्मारक का प्रस्ताव सबसे पहले वर्ष 2004 में तत्कालीन कांग्रेस-राष्ट्रवादी कांग्रेस पार्टी सरकार द्वारा रखा गया था। फिर बाद में भारतीय जनता पार्टी-शिवसेना सरकार और शिवसेना-कांग्रेस-राष्ट्रवादी कांग्रेस पार्टी सरकार द्वारा इसे आगे बढ़ाया गया। वर्तमान में शिवसेना-भाजपा-राकांपा (अजित पवार गुट) शासन के तहत अब भी यह एक ‘जीवित मुद्दा’ बना हुआ है। प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी द्वारा 24 दिसंबर 2016 को मोटरबोट में जाकर मरीन ड्राइव समुद्र तट के सामने 1.5 किलोमीटर दूर प्रस्तावित स्थल पर ‘जल पूजा’ करने के बाद इस परियोजना के बड़े पैमाने पर शुरू होने की उम्मीद थी। बालासाहेब ठाकरे स्मारक शिवसेना के संस्थापक बाल ठाकरे के स्मारक के निर्माण का भी मेनिफेस्टो में जिक्र किया गया लेकिन तारीख नहीं बताई गयी है। यह स्मारक मध्य मुंबई के शिवाजी पार्क स्थित मेयर के बंगले में बन रहा है। आपको बता दें कि 17 नवंबर 2012 को शिवाजी पार्क में शिवसेना संस्थापक बालासाहेब ठाकरे का अंतिम संस्कार किया गया था। तब यह एक अस्थायी स्मारक विकसित किया गया था। जिसे भव्य स्मारक के रूप में विकसित करने को लेकर सभी पार्टियां एकमत थीं। (Latest Updates about Balasaheb Thackeray Smarak) स्मारक को भव्य स्वरूप देने की योजना फडणवीस के मुख्यमंत्री काल में शुरू हुई, जब राज्य सरकार ने मेयर बंगले में 400 करोड़ रुपये के स्मारक के लिए हरी झंडी दी। 6056 वर्ग मीटर में फैले इस परियोजना में बालासाहेब ठाकरे के कामों को प्रदर्शित किया गया है। महाराष्ट्र सरकार के राज में कितना है सुराज्य राज्य में अगर सुराज्य हो तो विकास भी संभव है। महाराष्ट्र में कानून व्यवस्था (Low and Order in Maharashtra) हो या गुड गवर्नेंस, (Good Governance of Maharashtra) सरकार ने सक्रिय भूमिका निभाई है। राज्य में कानून व्यवस्था को चुस्त दुरुस्त करते हुए पिछले 5 साल में पुलिस के 440 करोड़ के बजट में देवेंद्र फडणवीस ने बढ़ोतरी करते हुए इसे 2200 करोड़ लेकर आये। महाराष्ट्र के बड़े शहरों में सीसीटीवी का जाल बिछाना हो या साइबर पुलिस स्टेशन बनाना हो देवेंद्र फडणवीस और सीएम एकनाथ शिंदे को इसमें कामयाबी जरूर मिली है। सूखे की समस्या को हमेशा के लिए खत्म करने के लिए महाराष्ट्र सरकार ने फिर से जलयुक्त शिवार योजना की शुरुआत की। जिसकी वजह से जल संरक्षण के मामले में महाराष्ट्र नंबर-1 बन गया। महाराष्ट्र में पानी की समस्या को दूर करने के लिए जलयुक्त शिवार योजना को लाया गया है। इस योजना को देश के नामी-गिरामी उद्योगपति, बैंकर्स, एनजीओं और कई सारे धार्मिक ट्रस्ट भी समर्थन देने लगे हैं। योजना के तहत हर साल राज्य के 5,000 गांवों को पानी की समस्या से छुटकारा दिलाया जाएगा। महाराष्ट्र सरकार का मानना है कि किसानों को आत्महत्या करने से रोकने लिए उन्हें खेती के लिए पानी मुहैया कराना बेहद जरूरी है।"

    "article_content": "Popularly known as the land of ‘Dawn-lit mountains’ Arunachal Pradesh is one of the most beautiful States located in the North-Eastern part of India. It is a treasure trove of natural marvels, which makes it a preferred travel destination especially for those who love nature. Tawang, Ziro Valley, Roing, Sela Pass, Namdapha National Park, Bomdila, Dirang, Tezu, Pasighat, Nuranang Falls, Mechuka, Itanagar, Along, Bhalukpong, Sangti, Changlang, Bumla Pass, Anini, Daporijo, Hayuliang Village, Pakhui Wildlife Sanctuary and Gorichen Peak are some of the popular tourist attractions in Arunachal Pradesh. A land of tribal cultures, Buddhist monasteries, pristine lakes, high altitude mountains, and quaint hillside villages, Arunachal Pradesh also has beautiful festivals which are celebrated in different parts of the year. Arunachal Pradesh became a full-fledged state of India on 20th February 1987. This date is celebrated as Arunachal Pradesh Foundation Day every year. On Arunachal Pradesh Foundation Day 2024, here is a glimpse into some of the most popular and colourful festivals celebrated by its residents. Festivals of Arunachal Pradesh Losar Festival This is one of the main festivals of Arunachal Pradesh which is celebrated to welcome the Tibetan New Year spanning for a fortnight. With an aim to ward off evil and invite positive energy and peace in every home, the festival is marked by cleaning homes, hoisting religious flags over every house, offering prayers, reading Holy Scriptures and lighting butter lamps in every home. This festival is observed by people belonging to the Monpa tribe, which forms a dominant population in the state’s Tawang and West Kemang districts. The Monpas, who are the followers of Mahayana Buddhism, worship the local deity and enjoy local wine and traditional food together during the festival. They also dress up beautifully in ethnic jewellery and outfits. Tawang is one of the most popular tourist attractions in North East India. The festival is celebrated in February or early March and travellers flocking the valley during this part of the year can witness this beautiful festival. Traditional mask dance, Aji Lhamu is a major attraction of this festival. Dree Festival The Dree festival is celebrated in July first week every year. It is celebrated by the Apatani tribe, also known as Apa, which resides in the Ziro valley in the Lower Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh. It is an agricultural festival observed for seeking protection against insects and pests, famine and epidemics and praying for soil fertility of the soil. Worshipping is done in a place closer to the paddy fields, the exact venue is selected by the priest. Deities like Tamu, Metii, Danyi and Harniang are worshipped during this festival. Solung Festival Celebrated in the first week of September, Solung is a popular agriculture festival observed by the Adi Tribes residing in the lower part of Lower Dibang Valley district. After the seeds are sown, the people celebrate this festival seeking prosperity and good harvest. Guardian deities Kine Nane, Doying Bote, Pedong Nane and Gumin Soyin are worshipped during this festival. The festival is celebrated for five consecutive days. The first day is called ‘Solung-Gidi Dogin’ (day of preparation), the second is the main day which is called Doreph-Long (the day of animal sacrifice). On this day, animals like mithuns and pigs are sacrificed and offered to Dadi Bote, the god of domestic animals. Locally made rice beer ‘Apong’ and meat is exchanged by the tribal people as part of the celebration. The third day is called ‘Binnayat Binam’ (worshipping the goddess of crops and food), the fourth day is Taktor of Ekoph, (villagers prepare weapons), and on the fifth day, the priest gets a ceremonial send-off through music and dance. During the festival, the leader Miri sings the ‘Solung Abung’ and narrates stories of the origin of the ancestors of the tribe and their heroic feats every day in the evening. Ponung dance performed by beautifully decked up ladies is a major attraction of this festival. Ladies of all age groups take part in this. Chalo-Loku Festival Chalo-Loku or Loku is the main festival of the Nocte tribe residing in the Tirap district of Arunachal Pradesh. Also known as the Nocte Naga, this is a Tibeto-Burmese ethnic group. The three-day long agriculture festival is celebrated during July-August and October-November. It is marked by animal sacrifice in the beginning which is followed by the Chamkat ritual and folk dance. Dancers deck up in traditional costumes and jewellery. The dance is performed at the house of the Chief. People from all age groups take part in this dance. This is an interesting ritual, in which male children on reaching adolescence are included in the Paang (decision-making committee). Locally made rice wine ‘Apong’ is consumed by villagers together with their relatives and friends during this time. Pigs and buffaloes are sacrificed during this festival and the meat is cooked by the villagers."

    "article_content": "This weekend, more than 1,000 college and university students from across the country and around the world came together at the University of Chicago for the 11th annual CGI University (CGI U) meeting, making more than 700 Commitments to Action to address this generation’s most pressing challenges. New commitments this year include efforts to combat the opioid crisis in the United States by building an online platform to reduce stigma and provide access to the overdose medication, naloxone; promoting maternal health in Vietnam by developing a week-long reproductive education series for women led by health care professionals; and combating climate change by encouraging Nigerians to use public transportation though a mobile application. While speaking at the Closing Plenary, Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton urged students to work collaboratively to make a difference, “We have to keep doing what CGI U represents – which is to bring people together who want to be part of solving problems, who want to bring their talent and their energy and their optimism to that task.” In the lead up to the CGI U meeting, students had the opportunity to participate in a two-day “Codeathon” event co-hosted by CGI U, the CGI Action Network on Post-Disaster Recovery, and the Clinton Climate Initiative. Students were challenged to develop digital tools that can increase the effectiveness of response and recovery efforts following natural disasters. The winning team, Basic Aid Outreach (BAO), recognized at the closing plenary, created a platform that leverages existing social networks, the power of AI, and crowdsourced data to empower local volunteers and agencies to take the lead in delivering aid to victims of natural disasters in Southeast Asia. CGI U students at this year’s meeting also participated in the Resolution Social Venture Challenge. A collaboration between Clinton Global Initiative University and The Resolution Project, this competition provides a pathway to action for socially responsible young leaders who want to create change that matters. A total of $50,000 was awarded to winning projects, which address a wide range of challenges participants have observed firsthand in their communities, including special education in Chicago Public Schools, menstrual hygiene in Ghana, food waste in India , and much more."

    "article_content": "World Health Day is celebrated on 7 th April every year. Each year draws attention to a specific health topic of concern to people all over the world. The date of 7 th April marks the Foundation anniversary of the World Health Organization (WHO), which was established in 1948. The theme for World Health Day 2024 is ‘My health, my right’. Going with the theme, The CSR Journal takes a look into healthcare schemes offered by four states of India namely Odisha, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Haryana to benefit citizens, especially those who are marginalised and less privileged. While the Govt of Odisha offers Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana, West Bengal Government offers the Swasthya Sathi scheme, Andhra Pradesh Government is enhancing healthcare of its residents through the Aarogyasri scheme while on Haryana Day last year, the state government expanded the benefits of Ayushman/Chirayu scheme and introduced a cashless health facility for govt employees, pensioners and journalists. Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana – Odisha In December last year, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik launched the third phase of the Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana (BSKY), the flagship health assurance scheme of his government, to cover rural poor families that were left out in the first two phases. Patnaik said with this third phase of expansion, it is estimated that over 1.10 crore families, covering nearly 90 per cent of the state’s population will be provided health assurance under BSKY. The chief minister said that the BSKY will ensure that no family in Odisha is left vulnerable due to lack of financial resources to meet high expenditure for critical illnesses. As per the BSKY norms, the new beneficiaries will also be entitled to cashless care worth Rs 5 lakh per annum and the amount of coverage for women would be up to Rs 10 lakh in empanelled private hospitals both inside and outside the state. In the first phase of the BSKY, all services in public health facilities were made free of cost for all persons, irrespective of income or residence. In the second phase, BSKY provided cashless healthcare in private health facilities for all covered under Food Security Schemes and ration card holders. In the past five years, BSKY has provided free healthcare service to nearly 21 lakh patients with cashless healthcare of about Rs 4,500 crores, in private hospitals alone. Swasthya Sathi scheme – West Bengal Swasthya Sathi is a scheme that offers cashless hospitalisation up to Rs 5 lakh per family to those who cannot afford private healthcare across the state. The scheme was officially launched by Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee on 30th December 2016. Main Features of the Scheme include basic health cover for secondary and tertiary care up to Rs. 5 lakh per annum per family. It is paperless, cashless and smart card based. All pre-existing diseases are covered. There is no cap on the family size and parents of both the spouse are included. All dependent physically challenged persons in the family are also covered. The entire cost is borne by the State Government and no contribution from the beneficiary. Online Swathya Sathi Smart card is provided to each family on the day of Enrolment. Smart Card captures the details of the family members along with photographs, biometric, address, mobile number, caste ID etc. There is a 24X7 toll free Call Centre (18003455384) with feedback option along with Android based Swasthya Sathi Mobile app for assistance to the beneficiaries. Swasthya Sathi covers 85 million people, providing up to Rs 500,000 in universal health insurance. The scheme helps around 7,000 people get treated at around 2,500 private hospitals and nursing homes every day, as per state government officials. Aarogyasri scheme – Andhra Pradesh The “Dr. YSR Aarogyasri Health Insurance Scheme” was launched in 2007 by the Govt. of Andhra Pradesh to provide financial aid to low-income families within the state. The scheme is a PPP model in the field of Health Insurance, tailor-made to the health needs of poor patients and provides end-to-end cashless services for identified diseases under secondary and tertiary care through a network of service providers from Government and private sector. In December 2023, Andhra Pradesh government enhanced the coverage of its healthcare scheme for the poor, Dr YSR Aarogyasri, from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 25 lakh. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy said the revamped scheme will now provide free treatment costing up to Rs 25 lakh while expanding the coverage to about 4.25 crore people in the state under the purview of Aarogyasri. The treatment under the scheme is now being provided in 2,513 hospitals across the state, the Chief Minister said. The distribution of Smart Aarogyasri Cards with new features also started after the CM’s announcement of the upgraded scheme. The state government bears the medical expenses for Aarogyasri card holders once their hospital bill crosses Rs 1,000. The state-sponsored health insurance scheme, meant to provide universal health coverage to BPL (Below Poverty Line) families, is run by the Dr YSR Aarogyasri Health Care Trust, in consultation with insurance and healthcare specialists. It includes a network of service providers from the government and private sector. Ayushman/Chirayu scheme and cashless health facility for govt employees – Haryana On the occasion of Haryana Day, 1 st November, 2023, Former Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar launched two initiatives enhancing healthcare for residents of the state. The former Haryana CM extended coverage of the Ayushman/Chirayu scheme to families with annual income ranging from Rs 1.80 lakh to Rs 3 lakh. Earlier the scheme benefitted only families with an annual income below Rs 1.80 lakh. After expansion, the scheme will now benefit an additional 38,000 families. On the occasion, another healthcare initiative was rolled out. This is a cashless health facility for government employees, pensioners, and accredited journalists and the entire expenditure under the scheme will be borne by the state government. Under this scheme, cashless treatment can be availed for 1,340 diseases across 569 empanelled hospitals in Haryana. The initial phase incorporates 894 employees from the fisheries and horticulture departments, encompassing 1,055 disease packages and 305 hospitals. Future plans include the extension of this scheme to other departments within the state."

    "article_content": "The history of India’s freedom movement during the colonial regime will be incomplete if the role of vernacular press is not mentioned. Newspapers were a major tool for national awakening against colonial rule and a mouthpiece of protest against imperial injustices. These newspapers played a crucial role in influencing the masses, updating them about political developments and spreading the word about political ideologies and strategies that fuelled the movement for freedom. Newspapers as a mass medium helped in spreading the call for unity against British rule thereby encouraging India’s youth to come forward and take part in the movement to free their motherland from British colonial rule. Newspapers at that time were a weapon for influencing the masses and criticism of first the East India Company and later the British Raj; as a result, many were banned by the Government. Vernacular Press Act – 1878 The Vernacular Press Act was established by Lord Lytton in 1878 to repress voices in vernacular or non-English press criticising policies and activities of the British Government. This happened 20 years after the British crown took over the rule in India from the East India Company in 1858 following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The act was intended to control the vernacular press and take action against newspaper reports which encouraged sedition. As per this act, the content of printed newspapers was checked by the district magistrate and action was taken accordingly against reports termed seditious. The Vernacular Press Act also gave power to the British Government to ban newspapers and confiscate related its properties include the printing press. The act was revoke in 1881 by Lord Ripon, who succeeded Lord Lytton as the viceroy and is remembered as the “Good Viceroy of India”. India’s first newspaper – Bengal Gazette India’s first ever printed newspaper ‘Bengal Gazette’ was published in English language on 29th January, 1780, by Irish journalist James Augustus Hicky during the British Raj. The tabloid was also known as “Hicky’s Gazette” or “The Original Calcutta General Advertiser.” Indian Newspaper Day is observed every year on the 29th of January to mark the birthday of India’s first printed newspaper, which was known for its sarcasm and provocative journalism. The newspaper was highly critical about the administration of Governor General Warren Hastings. It was stopped on 30th March 1782 by the British Government who confiscated its types and the printing press.

    "article_content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday distributed more than 1 lakh appointment letters to newly inducted recruits via video conferencing under “Rozgar Mela”. Recruitment has been done for Government departments and organisations including Indian Railways and Indian Paramilitary Force. The PM says, “Rozgar Melas are playing a crucial role in enhancing the contribution of our Yuva Shakti in nation building.” He also laid the foundation stone of Phase I of the Integrated Complex “Karmayogi Bhavan” in New Delhi, which is aimed at promoting collaboration and synergy among various pillars of Mission Karmayogi. Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister said, “Today, more than 1 lakh youth have been given appointment letters for jobs in the government. You have achieved this success through hard work. The campaign to provide jobs to the youth in the Government of India is going on at a fast pace.” “Today the foundation stone of an integrated training complex has also been laid in Delhi. I am confident that the new training complex will further strengthen our capacity building initiatives,” he added. Recruitment in Railways through Rozgar Mela Addressing the new recruits, PM Modi informed that while many applicants under “Rozgar Mela” have bagged positions at the Indian Railways, many of them will be included in Indian Paramilitary Force. He said, “Today, recruitment is also being done in Indian Railways through the Rozgar Mela. Whenever people have to go on a long journey with their family, Indian Railways is still the first choice of the common family. Indian Railways is today going through a huge transformation. Indian Railways is going to be completely transformed by the end of this decade. We have started a campaign to reinvent the entire train travel experience. We focused on modernization and upgradation of railways. This time in the budget also, the government has announced that 40 thousand modern bogies like Vande Bharat Express will be prepared and added to normal trains. This will make the journey of common passengers more convenient.” Youths recruited in Indian Paramilitary Force through Rozgar Mela Talking about recruitment of eligible youths for Indian Paramilitary Force, the PM added, “Today, among the youth who have received appointment letters, a large number are going to be a part of the Paramilitary Force. This in itself is a big aspiration of the youth which is being fulfilled. In the last few years, the recruitment process in Paramilitary Force has been reformed. The decision to conduct written examination in 13 languages ​​apart from Hindi and English has been implemented from January this year. This has provided equal opportunity to lakhs of participants to prove their mettle. The quota for districts located on the border and districts affected by militancy has also been increased.” Recruitment process in Govt jobs “completely transparent” The PM highlighted that recruitment process in the Government of India in the present day is “completely transparent”. Taking a jibe at the previous government, the PM said, “In earlier governments, it used to take a very long time from the issue of job advertisement to the issuance of appointment letter. Taking advantage of this delay, the game of bribery was also rampant during that time. We have now made the recruitment process in the Government of India completely transparent. Not only this, the government is very insistent that the recruitment process be completed within the stipulated time. With this, every youth has started getting equal opportunity to prove his ability.” India is the world’s third largest startup ecosystem Highlighting the fact that our nation is the third largest startup ecosystem in the world, the PM said, “Today, India is the third largest startup ecosystem in the world. The number of startups in the country is now reaching around 1.25 lakh. I am very happy to see that a large number of these startups are happening in small tier-2, tier-3 cities which are not even district centres. Lakhs of jobs are being created for the youth in these startups. In this time’s budget, it has also been announced to extend the tax exemption given to startups. Our youth will benefit greatly from this.” The PM also reminded that in the interim budget declared earlier this month, it has been announced to create a new fund of Rs 1 lakh crore for research and innovation."

    "article_content": "In a landmark judgement, the Supreme Court on Thursday (15 th February) struck down the Central Government’s Electoral Bonds scheme calling it ‘unconstitutional’ and ‘violative of Right to Information’. The court also said that this bond is capable of making the donor eligible for taking advantage or favour from any political party. The apex court ordered the State of Bank of India (SBI) to stop issuing electoral bonds. The unanimous verdict was delivered by a five-judge Constitution bench headed by the Chief Justice of India (CJI) D Y Chandrachud along with Justices Sanjiv Khanna, BR Gavai, JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra. Interestingly, the verdict comes months before the Lok Sabha elections in 2024. What are electoral bonds? Why did the apex court strike it down? The CSR Journal takes a look. What are Electoral Bonds The Electoral Bonds scheme allowed anonymous funding to political parties. The scheme was started by the NDA Government in 2018. The identity of the donor is kept confidential both by the bank as well as by the political party which is receiving the donation. These bonds are issued by the State Bank of India (SBI) and are sold in multiples of Rs 1,000, 10,000, 1 lakh,10 lakh, and 1 crore. The contributor could buy a bond from SBI and the bank would release it to the political party. After the money is transferred, the recipient political party gets 15 days time period to encash it. All donations made under this scheme are anonymous and exempt of taxes. Electoral bonds, with a validity period of 15 days and yet to be encashed, would be returned by political parties or purchasers to the bank, which must refund the amount to the purchasers’ accounts. Under this scheme, political parties which are registered under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and which have received more than one per cent votes in the last Lok Sabha or state legislative assembly elections are eligible to receive electoral bonds. How much did political parties receive through Electoral Bonds As per reports, talking about donations received till April 2022, Rs 9,856.72 crore has been received through electoral bonds since its inception in 2017-18, with ruling party BJP alone receiving Rs 5,271.97 crore . Other parties which have received anonymous donations include Congress (Rs 952.29), Trinamool Congress (Rs 767.88 crore), the Biju Janata Dal (Rs 622 crore) and the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (Rs 383.65 crore) in the abovementioned time period. Apex Court’s instruction to SBI regarding Electoral Bonds The State Bank of India (SBI) has issued Electoral Bonds worth Rs 16,518 crore in 30 tranches since the beginning of the scheme in 2018. The Supreme Court has ordered the State of Bank of India to stop issuing electoral bonds and directed the bank to submit details of bonds purchased from 12 th April, 2019, till date to the Election Commission of India (ECI). The bank has been given time till 6 th March, 2024 to share the information with ECI. Why this decision A five-judge Constitution bench headed by CJI D Y Chandrachud has declared Electoral Bonds as ‘unconstitutional’. The Court said the scheme violates the constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression as well as the right to information. The scheme violates the voters’ Right to Information about political funding under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. “This is violative of the principle of free and fair elections and political equality captured in a value of ‘one person, one vote’,” stated Chief Justice Chandrachud. Scheme empowered corporates The scheme allowed inflow of huge contributions by business conglomerates, top corporate companies and multinational corporations with major business stakes in the country to political parties. The scheme and the amendments authorised “unrestrained influence of corporates in the electoral process” said the court. The Apex Court has said anonymity about the source of political funding through electoral bonds can promote corruption and a culture of quid pro quo with the ruling party to introduce a policy change or for getting a licence."

Central Financial Assistance (CFA) for Residential Rooftop Solar The scheme provides a Central Financial Assistance (CFA) of 60% of system cost for 2 kW systems and 40% of additional system cost for systems between 2 and 3 kW capacity. The CFA will be capped at 3 kW. At current benchmark prices, this means Rs 30,000 subsidy for 1 kW system, Rs 60,000 for 2 kW systems and Rs 78,000 for 3 kW systems or higher. Households will be able to access collateral-free low-interest loan products of around 7% at present for installation of residential RTS systems up to 3 kW. Features of the Scheme A Model Solar Village will be developed in each district of the country to act as a role model for adoption of rooftop solar in rural areas, Urban Local Bodies and Panchayati Raj Institutions shall also benefit from incentives for promoting RTS installations in their areas. The scheme provides a component for payment security for Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) based models as well as a fund for innovative projects in RTS.

    "article_content": "India’s third-largest two-wheeler company TVS Motor Company is a reputed two and three-wheeler manufacturer globally operating in across 80 countries. TVS has been championing progress through Sustainable Mobility with four state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Hosur, Mysuru and Nalagarh in India and Karawang in Indonesia. TVS Motor Company is the First Indian two and three-wheeler maker to have become a signatory to the world’s largest sustainability initiative, the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). This will ensure enhanced collaborations and actions towards wider development of goals, particularly the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In the FY 2022-23, the company spent Rs 19 crore on CSR initiatives, which is slightly more than what it was obligated to spend as per the Company’s Act (Rs 18.61 cr). CSR – Srinivasan Services Trust Srinivasan Services Trust (SST) Srinivasan Services Trust (SST), the social arm of TVS Motor Company and Sundaram-Clayton Limited started working in villages established in 1996. Starting with a model of philanthropy, it matured into a model centred on community participation in all its projects. Presently, SST works in 2500 villages across the country with 2,000 villages in Tamil Nadu. It follows a holistic and participatory approach of village development, working very closely with the community and the government. SST’s focus is to bring about sustainable development in villages through Total Community Involvement. Society building through development of women and children, conservation of water, providing holistic health and education infrastructure by renovating the government infrastructure and preserving the environment are its main focus areas. SST works towards economic development of the community by helping them to set up microenterprises and supporting them to improve agriculture and livestock income. SST’s holistic approach focuses on critical areas of Economic Development, Health, Education, Infrastructure, Environment and Social and Cultural Development in the villages. SST works with communities and governments to empower India’s rural poor through awareness, skills and training programs. Over the last 27 years, SST, with the help of TVS Motor Company, has been actively facilitating sustainable and self-reliant development across 2,500 villages in India, bringing a paradigm of holistic and sustained socio-economic change at the grassroots level across India. Over Rs 85 crore have been contributed by TVS Motor Company towards Covid- 19 relief. An impact study carried out by Institute of Rural Management (IRMA), Anand has revealed that in the villages in Tiruvannamalai district, where SST has been working, shows an household income growth of about 141% in 5 years (2017-2022) as compared only to a 38% household income growth in neighbouring areas. CSR of TVS Motor Company: 2022-2023 CSR for Water Conservation Srinivasan Services Trust announced in March 2023 that it has over the last six years, invested over Rs 21 crores in water conservation efforts across villages of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. At least 350 desilting projects including desilting of tanks and irrigation channels have been undertaken by SST increasing the water storage availability by 160 crore litres (57 million cubic feet). Additionally, with active participation by the local communities and through their association with National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), SST has implemented programmes in Javadhu Hills in Tiruvannamalai & Tirupathur districts and Thally in Krishnagiri district in which 19 check dams and 120 farm ponds have been created. In partnership with other organizations, SST has also implemented watershed programs in Tirunelveli and Tiruvannamalai districts of Tamil Nadu. SST has also desilted 7 water bodies in Krishnagiri district inside the forests, with the support of the government, which has in turn increased water availability for wild animals. The Trust plans to invest over 10 crore rupees in the next three years for water conservation initiatives. A study by the Centre for Water Resources (CWR), Anna University on 3 minor irrigation (MI) tanks in Krishnagiri, Tiruvannamalai and Tirunelveli districts revealed that partial desilting of water bodies has made the water available for more than one cropping season 79% of farmers adopted changes in the cropping pattern and cultivating more than one season. The underground water storage capacity has improved and there is an increase in water level in bore wells and open wells in the area. CSR for Tiger Conservation Srinivasan Services Trust announced in July 2023 that it has invested Rs 20 million (2 crore) in various conservation initiatives, including water conservation, forest equipment, transportation, and anti-poaching camps across six tiger reserves in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The trust is working to improve living conditions for staff members of the forest department and to construct anti-poaching camps equipped with solar power and drinking water facilities. SST’s tiger conservation programme aligns with their broader mission of developing tribal villages, for which the trust has invested over INR 250 million over the past 16 years. In 2022, SST donated a minibus to the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve. Additionally, SST contributed to the Bandipur Tiger Reserve by donating two forest-road-friendly motorcycles and provided tractors for water transportation in Mudumalai (Tamil Nadu) and Bandhavgarh (Madhya Pradesh).

The company also announced Rs 50 lakh towards disaster relief in Michaung-affected Andhra Pradesh. “The floods have unleashed severe hardship on the community, and we would like to do our part to support the community. This will augment the tireless efforts of the government and the resilient people of Tamil Nadu to restore normalcy.

    "article_content": "अगर आप कैंसर से पीड़ित है और आपका ट्रीटमेंट चल रहा है तो दोबारा कैंसर के फैलने का चांसेस होता है। Cancer Treatment के बाद भी कई मरीजों में कैंसर वापस फैल जाता है। Tata Memorial Hospital के डॉक्टरों ने एक रिसर्च कर कैंसर दोबारा ना हो इसका इलाज खोजा है। टाटा अस्पताल के खारघर स्थित एडवांस सेंटर फॉर ट्रीटमेंट, रिसर्च एंड एजुकेशन इन कैंसर (एक्ट्रेक) अस्पताल के डॉ. इंद्रनील मित्रा के नेतृत्व में ये Cancer Research किया गया है। जिसमें बताया गया है कि रिसर्च में चूहों पर शोध किया है। चूहों में मनुष्य के कैंसर सेल डाले गए। जिसके बाद उनमें ट्यूमर निर्माण हुआ। उसके बाद रेडिएशन थेरेपी, कीमोथेरेपी और सर्जरी के जरिए उनका इलाज किया। इसके बाद कैंसर सेल्स नष्ट होकर उनके बहुत छोटे-छोटे टुकड़े हो गए। यह मरते हुए कैंसर सेल में से क्रोमेटिन कण (क्रोमोजोन के टुकड़े) ब्लड वेन्स के जरिए शरीर के दूसरे हिस्से में पहुंच जाते हैं। ये शरीर में मौजूद अच्छे सेल्स में मिल जाते हैं और उन्हें भी कैंसर सेल में तब्दील कर देते हैं। इस कैंसर रिसर्च से यह स्पष्ट हो गया है कि कैंसर सेल नष्ट होने बावजूद वापस आ जाते हैं। इलाज के दौरान दोबारा कैंसर होने से रोकेगी 100 रुपये की ये टैबलेट Recurring Cancer की समस्या का हल खोजने के लिए डॉक्टरों ने चूहों को रेसवेरेट्रॉल और कॉपर (तांबा) के संयुक्त प्रो-ऑक्सिडेंट टेबलेट दी। यह टैबलेट क्रोमोजोन को बेअसर करने में असरदार रही। टाटा मेमोरियल सेंटर (Tata Memorial Centre) के पूर्व निदेशक डॉ. राजेंद्र बडवे ने The CSR Journal से ख़ास बातचीत करते हुए बताया कि कैंसर के इलाज (Cancer Treatment in India) को बेहतर बनाने की दिशा में अधिक शोध की जरूरत है। डॉ. इंद्रनील मित्रा (Dr. Indraneel Mittra) के शोध से दुनियाभर में कैंसर ट्रीटमेंट को और भी बेहतर बनाने में मदद मिलेगी। वहीं टाटा मेमोरियल सेंटर के उपनिदेशक सेंटर फॉर कैंसर एपिडेमियोलॉजी डॉ. पंकज चतुर्वेदी ने बताया कि समस्या की जड़ का पता लगाने के साथ-साथ उसका निवारण भी उतना ही जरूरी है। कॉपर- रेसवेरेट्रॉल के एक घरेलू नुस्खा है। कैंसर के इलाज को बेहतर बनाने और इलाज के दौरान होने वाले दुष्परिणामों को कम करने में भी मददगार साबित होता है। रेसवेरेट्रॉल अंगूर, बेरीज के छिलके सहित अन्य पदार्थों से मिलता है। कई खाद्य पदार्थों से भी कॉपर मिलता है। कैंसर इलाज में अभी कॉपर- रेसवेरेट्रॉल की दवाई पर कई मंजूरी बाकी है एडवांस सेंटर फॉर ट्रीटमेंट, रिसर्च एंड एजुकेशन इन कैंसर (एक्ट्रेक) के डॉक्टरों का दावा है कि ये न्यूट्रास्यूटिकल कैंसर के साइड इफेक्ट्स को 50 फीसदी कम कर सकती है। साथ ही दोबारा कैंसर होने के खतरे को 30 फीसदी तक रोक सकती है। हालांकि टाटा कैंसर हॉस्पिटल ने इस दवा को लेकर कोई कीमत तय नहीं कि है लेकिन मीडिया रिपोर्ट्स के मुताबिक दवा की कीमत करीब 100 रुपए हो सकती है। फिल्हाल दवा को फूड सेफ्टी एंड स्टैंडर्ड अथॉरिटी ऑफ इंडिया (FSSAI) के अप्रूवल का इंतजार है। सामान्य तौर पर किसी दवा को अप्रूवल के लिए सेंट्रल ड्रग्स स्टैंडर्ड कंट्रोल ऑर्गनाइजेशन (CDSCO) से मान्यता चाहिए होती है। जो स्वास्थ्य एवं परिवार कल्याण मंत्रालय के अंतर्गत काम करता है। किसी भी नई प्रिसक्रिप्शन दवा को देश में बेचने के लिए Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) से अप्रूवल की जरूरत पड़ती है। चूंकि जिस कैंसर की दवा की बात हम कर रहे हैं। वो न्यूट्रास्यूटिकल फूड सप्लीमेंट है इसलिए इसे भारतीय खाद्य संरक्षा एवं मानक प्राधिकरण (FSSAI) से मान्यता की जरूरत पड़ेगी, जो खाने-पीने की चीजों पर निगरानी रखने वाली संस्था है। देश में हर साल करीब 14 लाख कैंसर के मामले सामने आ रहे हैं कैंसर की ये दवाई साइड इफेक्ट को कम करता है। टाटा के बोन मैरो ट्रांसप्लांट विशेषज्ञ डॉ. नवीन खत्री के अनुसार इलाज के दौरान मरीज के मुंह में छाले पड़ जाते हैं, कॉपर- रेसवेरेट्रॉल के सेवन से इस तकलीफ से काफी राहत मिलती है। मुंह के कैंसर की कोशिकाओं की आक्रामकता को कॉपर- रेसवेरेट्रॉल का टैबलेट देने के बाद कैंसर सेल की तीव्रता कम हो गई। पेट से संबंधित कैंसर मरीजों के इलाज के दौरान हाथ और पांव की स्किन छूटने के साइड इफेक्ट को भी कम करने में इससे मदद मिलती है। ब्रेन ट्यूमर के मरीजों में भी कॉपर- रेसवेरेट्रॉल के सेवन से बेहतर परिणाम मिले हैं। देश में हर साल करीब 14 लाख कैंसर के मामले सामने आ रहे हैं। जिसमें से करीब 9 लाख लोग अपनी जान गंवा देते हैं। कैंसर के साथ एक बड़ी समस्या ये है कि ये एक बार ठीक होने के बाद दोबारा भी हो सकता है। इसी सिलसिले में वैज्ञानिक सालों से रिसर्च कर रहे हैं कि आखिर एक बार इलाज के बाद कैंसर वापस कैसे लौट आता है। इसी कड़ी में टाटा मेमोरियल हास्पिटल के डॉक्टरों ने बड़ी सफलता मिलने का दावा किया है।"

    "article_content": "Faridabad is a major industrial and residential city in the State of Haryana . It falls in the National Capital Region (NCR), and has grown enormously during the last couple of decades, particularly because a large number of industries have come up in the town. The city was founded back in 1607 by Shaikh Farid, treasurer of Jahangir, with the object of protecting the highway which passed through the town. Faridabad district became the 12th district of Haryana on 15th August 1979. Faridabad is famous for producing henna, while tractors, motorcycles, switch gears, refrigerators, footwear and tyre-making are other famous industries there. CSR in Faridabad is witnessing more funding in the recent past because of its proximity to the fast-developing cities of Delhi and Gurugram. Here are some of the highest-rated corporate social responsibility initiatives in this flourishing town Faridabad was the second largest recipient of CSR funds in FY 2021-22 in Haryana. The district received Rs. 62.58 Cr. in CSR funds in FY 2021-22 from 163 companies. The top three contributors in Faridabad include Escorts Kubota Limited, American Express (India) Private Limited, and JCB India Limited, spending Rs. 6.63 Cr., Rs. 4.03 Cr., and Rs. 3.25 Cr. respectively through CSR. The top three areas of focus of CSR initiatives in the district were Health, Environment, and Education, which received Rs. 30.8 Cr., Rs.12.17 Cr., and Rs. 12.51 Cr., respectively. M3M Group set up library and a youth training centre M3M Foundation signed a partnership agreement with District Administration, Faridabad at the District CSR Meet, organised by Haryana State CSR Trust for renovating and refurbishing the community library and establishing “iMpower Academy for Skills”. This is in addition to the earlier agreement signed for setting up an Early Child Care and Education centre in Faridabad. M3M Foundation was also awarded the appreciation for Spirit of Philanthropy by the district administration of Faridabad on the occasion. Speaking on occasion, Dr. Payal Kanodia, praised the efforts of the district administration and assured them for all the support from the foundation and its resources for the development of children and youth of the district. AkzoNobel AkzoNobel is a Dutch multinational company known for creating paints and consumer coating for both industry and consumers worldwide. You will probably the luxury paint brand Dulux, which falls under its stable. The company has rolled out a paints training project for the inmates of Faridabad district jail as a part of its rehabilitation programme for prison inmates. Under this project, 125 inmates were trained in the professional skills of decorative painting. Some of them were employed after the completion of their prison term. AkzoNobel also partnered with Faridabad Observation Home for young offenders to provide formal training in decorative painting to its inmates. The objective of the project is to equip the youth with vocational skills, making them job-ready as painters once they make their way into the world. This new division of the CSR project was kickstarted with the launch of the first batch comprising 15 students between the age group of 17-18 years at the Observation Home. In the wake of COVID-19, AkzoNobel India partnered with Faridabad District Prison to make three-layered face masks for frontline health workers, daily wage labourers and their families in Gurgaon. BLEAP scholarship for girls – Microsoft On the occasion of Women’s Day 2021, Ed4All – a digital formal education platform – joined hands with Microsoft to roll out 400 scholarships for girl students across eight districts of India, starting with Faridabad. The BLEAP Scholarship for Women of Tomorrow will enable girls to study from Class 9 to 12 on NIOS and Microsoft Learn curriculum. In addition, BLEAP-Microsoft CoNE will help students who can’t afford to purchase the device for e-learning to borrow them and accelerate their learning capacities. Both are transformational initiatives to support girls to successfully complete their school education by enabling them to be job-ready. Besides access to cutting-edge technology such as AI and Azure, the CSR initiative is also set to provide access to a wide selection of certified technology courses by Microsoft and Pearson’s Certiport and fully prepare them to be inducted into the workforce. Shafi Mohammed, Chairman of Iqraa Public School in Faridabad, who has gender and social equality at the heart of his values, is hopeful this CSR partnership will make Faridabad a 21st-century beacon. Sai Dham Vocational Training Centre Shirdi Sai Baba Vocational Training Centre – popularly known as Sai Dham – in Faridabad provides free vocational training to women and youth. Real estate firm Shiv Sai Infrastructure, BHEL, Honda and ONGC are among the many CSR partners of this NGO that has been alleviating poverty since 1988. Hundreds of women have benefitted from the vocational courses in computers, industrial sewing, elderly healthcare, beauty and wellness, logistics. Take the case of Preeti from Faridabad. Daughter of a mechanic, Preeti was living in a makeshift jhopadi when she joined the Beauty & Wellness training programme at Sai Dham. She acquired the requisite skills and successfully bagged the certificate of Assistant Beautician under National Skill Qualification Framework. The talented young girl went on to become a trainer herself. Thanks to her income, her family was able to build a pucca house for themselves. Preeti is a source of inspiration for other young girls in her community. Toyota Driving School The Toyota Driving School in Faridabad was the first one in the Delhi/NCR region. Auto company Toyota’s mission behind this road safety initiative is to have ‘Safest Cars with Safest Drivers’. The NCRB (National Crime Records Bureau) report has revealed that an average of 17 people are killed in road accidents each and every hour, and the primary reason for road accidents is poor road safety practices. This facility is equipped with driving simulators so that the new driver can learn in a safe and controlled environment. The simulator is based on the cabin of Toyota Etios. This system is said to train the learner about fine control of brake, accelerator, and steering. Moreover, the simulator can also replicate tricky driving situations like fog, rain, low light, driving uphill, and driving downhill. The students are trained to handle basic diagnostics, maintenance and repair of the car. So, it’s not “just another driving school” for getting a driving license, but more of a place that follows a comprehensive approach ensuring that every single student becomes a responsible driver and a safety ambassador in creating a safe road for everyone to use."

    "article_content": "With an aim to enhance green cover of India’s National Highways, The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is taking initiatives to plant trees through the Miyawaki method of tree plantation. Miyawaki method is a unique Japanese approach to ecological restoration and afforestation development. If the Miyawaki plantation in Delhi/NCR is successful, the government will replicate this initiative across the country. The government plans to focus on planting indigenous species of plants that can survive in the local climate and soil conditions. Tree plantation will be done at various locations on pieces of lands adjacent to the National Highways. Total land area of over 53 acres has been identified at different places in and around Delhi-NCR to establish the Miyawaki plantations, as per an official statement from the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways. What is Miyawaki Method? Miyawaki method is a Japanese approach of afforestation which is very effective in urban areas where there is shortage of space. This method aims to create dense, native, and biodiverse forests in a short period of time. These forests retain ground water and help to recharge the ground water table. With this method, trees grow ten times faster and the plantations act as a sound and dust barrier. Miyawaki Forests contribute towards the creation of a resilient ecosystem, offering a range of benefits to both the environment and local community. They also have multiple long-term benefits, which include improvement in micro-climatic conditions such as improvement in air & soil quality. They also contribute to biodiversity conservation, rapid growth of green cover, efficient carbon absorption, soil restoration and in habitat creation for local flora and fauna. “Using the Miyawaki method, increase in green cover will not only help to enhance the overall health and well-being of citizens living along the National Highways, but will also add to the aesthetics and pleasure of commuting on the National Highways in NCR,” reads a statement by the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways. Where will saplings be planted? Tree plantation will commence during the monsoon and is expected to be completed by the end of August. Some of the sites proposed for development of Miyawaki plantations along the National Highways include 4.7 acres of land area along Haryana section of Dwarka Expressway, 4.1 acres near Sohna on Delhi – Vadodara section of Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, around 5 acres each at Chabri and Kharkhara interchanges on NH 152D of Ambala – Kotputli corridor in Haryana, over 12 acres at Shamli bypass on NH-709B, 9.2 acres at Duhai interchange on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway near Ghaziabad and 5.6 acres near Meerut-Najibabad section of NH-34 in Uttar Pradesh. Govt of India initiatives to encourage tree plantation The Government of India is encouraging plantation in the country through several programmes and schemes such as National Mission for Green India, National Afforestation Programme, Nagar Van Yojana, School Nursery Yojana, Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority funds, etc. which promotes tree plantation on waste, vacant and barren lands by involving local communities, NGOs, educational institutions, etc. In April this year, the NHAI organized a day long national workshop in New Delhi to discuss different aspects of environmental impact assessment, planning and mitigation for holistic National Highway development. The sessions included discussion on issues related to Wildlife Clearances; Insights on ‘Eco-friendly Measures to Mitigate Impacts of Linear Infrastructure on Wildlife’; Issues related to Forest & Environment Clearances; Environmental Impact Assessment, Environmental Management Plan, Coastal Regulation Zone Clearances, Regulations and its applicability to Road Infrastructure Projects."

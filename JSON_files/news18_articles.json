    "article_content": "Written By : Sudipto Banerjee & deepti-thakkar News18.com Last Updated: January 23, 2024, 16:00 IST New Delhi, India In November 2023, the Punjab and Haryana high court’s decision struck down the Haryana law as unconstitutional. (Credit: Twitter) Lack of public debate often results in bad laws. Of late, the state governments across India have been making reservation laws to mandate the private sector to provide jobs to local residents. Some of these states are Jharkhand , Andhra Pradesh , and Haryana . Not only do these laws pose a constitutional threat, but they also often carry a strong undertone of regionalism for immediate political gains. We argue in this post that such state laws forcing the private sector to guarantee jobs indicate a bigger problem ─ the government making laws in a non-transparent and non-consultative manner. Last year in November 2023, the Punjab and Haryana high court’s decision struck down the Haryana law — the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020 (HSELC Act) — as unconstitutional [violated Article 16(3) which permits only Parliament to make laws on reservation in public employment and Article 19 which guarantees individual’s right to move freely and practice trade, commerce, and intercourse throughout India]. For readers who are not aware of the HSELC Act, it mandated 75 per cent employment of local candidates (domiciled in the state of Haryana which is to be decided basis the Parivar Pehchan Patra issued under the Haryana Parivar Pehchan Act, 2021 ) by private employers where the gross monthly salary or wages are less than a specified amount (initially Rs 50,000, later amended to Rs 30,000) – refer this . Merely since the state resources are poor and limited, the private employer cannot be forced to employ based on the reservation policy in favour of local candidates. Probably with these strong remarks, the high court has set a promising precedent, especially, when there is a disturbing trend of ruling parties across state governments making similar laws for immediate electoral gains. For instance, such laws have been enacted in states like Andhra Pradesh (date of operation notified but the Act has been challenged before the Andhra Pradesh High Court) and Jharkhand (local associations are exploring options to challenge the law). Although the Haryana state government has moved to the Supreme Court, given the detailed judgement of the high court, it is unlikely that the Supreme Court would uphold the HSELC Act. In any case, it will settle the legal position. Surprisingly, the HSECL Act was passed when there were precedents where the Supreme Court held that the legislative power to create residential qualifications for employment is exclusively conferred on the Parliament. [ AVS Narasimha Rao Case (1969) , Pradeep Jain case (1984) & Saurabh Chaudri case (2003) ]. Was the Haryana state government not adequately advised on the legality of the HSECL Act? Further, it is not clear before the HSELC Act was enacted whether the state government tried to answer some of the basic questions: Recently, the Ministry of I&B through the Broadcasting Bill has put all OTT content services in the basket of traditional broadcasting services. Again, a major decision taken with no prior public consultation. Similarly, at the level of state governments, it is unclear how many laws are being discussed and debated in the public domain. Discussions on laws in state assemblies are few. As per statistics of the PRS Legislative report on Annual Review of State Laws, 2022 , most state legislatures met for an average of less than 25 days in a year between 2016 and 2022 and met mostly for the budget session. Recently, the Rajasthan government passed the gig workers protection law in a hush-hush manner. While the bill was released in the public domain on July 1, 2023, in a marathon style, within less than a month’s time, the state legislative assembly passed the bill on July 24, 2023. Early this month, a meeting was convened by the Haryana government to announce its proposal of a law for the protection of gig workers in the state. Even if we assume that such a law is needed, in the scheme of regulatory governance, public consultation requires debating various options before jumping the gun. Such debates hardly happen and like an authoritarian state, diktats are issued. In the global context, the US has a federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act which lays down the public consultation process to be followed by all federal agencies. In South Africa, public consultation requirements are given in their Constitution (Refer, sections 59 & 72). While the UK does not have a law, the cabinet office is responsible for the government consultation principles, which provide departments with guidance on conducting consultations. Individual departments are responsible for their own consultation practice. In February 2014, the Government of India issued a Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy which mandated departments to proactively publish proposed legislations on the internet and/or other public domains with additional details such as a brief justification for the legislation, essential elements, broad financial implications, an estimated assessment of the impact of such legislation on the environment, fundamental rights, lives and livelihoods of the concerned/affected people, etc. After almost 10 years, a 2019 study ( Democratising Law Making – The Tale of PLCP ) shows the performance of the pre-legislative consultation policy has been abysmal. Out of many of its findings, one of them states that from 2014 till 2019, a total of 186 bills were introduced in the Parliament, out of which 142 saw no public consultation. Of the 44 bills placed in the public domain for receipt of comments, 24 of them did not adhere to the 30-day deadline. Given the above situation, there is a need for serious debate to design a horizontal-parliamentary law. Transparent and participative law-making cannot be overemphasised. Our civil society must demand for a codified obligation, so it is mandatory for all organs of the state (Centre, state government, statutory regulators, etc) to make laws or delegated legislation (rules or regulations) through a consultative process. Meaning, a fixed duration to respond to the draft instrument, disclosure of public response, and most importantly, the government’s response to the public response explaining its rationale behind the final decision. In sum, a law should not be allowed to come into operation unless it meets these basic requirements, until there is a pressing emergency to skip the set process. At present, most explanatory memoranda attached to the draft bills barely offer any analysis of the government’s position or justification, other than a factual summary of the proposed clauses in the draft bill. Most ministries do not bother to publish public comments. Critiques would say easier said than done. Probably true. This exercise would need substantial capacity building across government, time, and resources. Most importantly, a willingness to change. But to justify our claim of a democratic and aspiring developed nation, this is the benchmark India must strive for. Cut to the issue of job reservation laws, the state is expected to enable the right situations, like providing better infrastructure and affordable skilling initiatives for the youth, so the private sector can flourish and youth get ample opportunities. But it is not the duty of the private sector to provide jobs. And certainly, the state cannot direct a private employer as to who it has to employ to guarantee jobs.

    "article_content": "Curated By : Entertainment Bureau Local News Desk Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 14:41 IST Delhi, India Raj Babbar's second wife Smita Patil died in 1986. Actor-turned-politician Raj Babbar celebrated his 72nd birthday on June 23. The actor was known as both the hero and villain in the 80s. He wanted to become an actor since childhood. He was interested in acting, so in 1975 he enrolled at the National School of Drama (NSD) in Delhi. As soon as he completed his acting course, he started working on other films. He has worked in more than 1,560 films in Bollywood. His first film was Kissa Kursi Ka, which was released in 1977. The actor got his real identity from the film Insaaf Ka Tarazu, where he played a negative role. As soon as this film was released, Raj Babbar became director BR Chopra’s favourite hero. In the 80s, Raj Babbar was such an actor who could easily fit into all roles from villain to hero. He is famous for films like Prem Geet, Umrao Jaan, Nikaah, Agar Tum Na Hote, Majdoor, Mehndi, Aaj Ki Awaaz, Haqiqat, Sau Din Saas Ke, Salma, Corporate, Bodyguard, Karz, Fashion, Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster 2, Bullet Raja and Tevar. Like his films, Raj Babbar’s personal life has also been in the headlines. He was married twice to Nadira Babbar and Smita Patil. It is said that despite being already married to Nadira in 1975 and the father of two children, Raj had an extramarital affair. He was so much in love with the actress Smita Patil, that he ignored everyone and started living a live-in relationship with her. Raj Babbar was criticised a lot for this, but he never cared about it. According to reports, the actor’s steps went astray during the 80s. His stardom was at its peak during this time. It was the year 1984 when Raj Babbar and Smita Patil met for the first time. Raj and Smita became close during the film Aaj Ki Awaaz released in the same year. According to the Hindu religion, a second marriage is not allowed while the first wife is alive. But, Raj Babbar left his first wife Nadira and his two children and married Smita Patil without divorcing his first wife. A few years after their marriage, their son Prateek Babbar was born. Smita Patil died on December 13, 1986, just two weeks after giving birth to their son. After Smita’s death, the actor returned to his first wife, Nadira. Nadira and Raj Babbar have children Juhi and Arya. Earlier in an interview with The Times of India, the actor said, “Smita entered my life unexpectedly. When I met Smita Patil for the first time, I realised there was depth to her character. She was generally very friendly and sought my advice once in a while. Gradually, we formed an intimate bond. My relationship with Smita was not the result of problems with Nadira- it just happened. Nadira was mature enough to understand my feelings.”"

But OnePlus claims it has finally cracked the code behind a long battery life for smartphones with its new technology that has been developed in partnership with CATL. OnePlus says the Glacier Battery tech has the potential to not only make smartphone batteries last longer, but also keep them lean and lightweight at the same time. Not since the days of the old and classic Nokia phones, battery life has kept users happy. OnePlus is working on changing this for good. The brand has revealed the details about the battery tech via its Weibo post in China, but we expect the development to be passed on globally, including India. OnePlus seems to be hinting at a new paradigm for smartphone batteries which could end the whole anxiety aspect that forces people to carry power banks or their adapters with them all the time. The company is known for its fast-charging tech but even then, most people would prefer to have a phone that can last for more than a day and the Glacier tech could be the answer to those issues. Reducing the density of the battery packs inside the phone could ensure that you don’t have to bear the thick bricks of phones that a 6,000mAh unit tends to produce. We could see a OnePlus phone sporting this battery tech very soon, and China could be the venue where the glacier tech could make its debut with the rumoured OnePlus Ace 3 Pro smartphone. Now, imagine a phone carrying a 6,100mAh battery that can fast-charge when needed and also last longer than ever before. That’s the dream for millions and we could see it turn into reality this year."

(Photo Credits: YouTube) As the seventh and final season of Young Sheldon approaches, fans of the show are preparing for a significant moment in the show. The series, which explores the early life of Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory, has always hinted at the eventual passing of Sheldon’s father, George Sr. According to the maker of Young Sheldon, a spin-off prequel to The Big Bang Theory, one of the most pivotal moments in Sheldon’s life was the death of his father when he was a teenager, and this event is set to take place in Season 7. In an interview with TVLine, executive producer Steve Holland confirmed that the passing of Sheldon’s father will be addressed in the final season. While not revealing specific details, Holland claims that the show aims to stay true to the larger storylines and events that shape Sheldon’s life, even if it means not adhering to every joke or detail from The Big Bang Theory. “I don’t want to say what you will or won’t see, but things will get addressed,\" Holland explained. “We are not beholden to every joke that was ever made on The Big Bang Theory, but we do feel beholden to the larger canon and the larger events that shape Sheldon’s life. We want to honor those,\" he added. He further said that Young Sheldon has always existed within the same timeline as The Big Bang Theory, despite having a different tone. The passing of George Sr. is a crucial part of Sheldon’s backstory and will not be ignored or avoided in Young Sheldon. “That is a thing that happens in Sheldon’s life. This is the same character (from The Big Bang Theory). We are living in the same universe as The Big Bang Theory and that sort of world-building is important. Big things that (Adult Sheldon said) happened in his life without a doubt happened,\" Holland mentioned. Watch Young Sheldon Season 7’s Trailer here: Apart from Holland, CBS Entertainment President Amy Reisenbach also talked about the series and praised it for its unique storytelling and remarkable cast, stating that the show has successfully captured the essence of the Cooper family and their heartfelt stories. “As a prequel to one of the biggest comedies, Young Sheldon proved lightning can strike twice,\" Reisenbach said, as reported by Comicbook. She further expressed gratitude to the executive producers and the entire team for their work over six seasons and looks forward to the final season’s conclusion. “Being able to tell the origin of Sheldon Cooper, and expanding the story to include the entire Cooper family has been a wonderful experience,\" said executive producers Steve Holland, Steven Molaro, and Chuck Lorre. “We are grateful to our fans for embracing this chapter of the Coopers these past six seasons, and on behalf of the entire Young Sheldon family, we’re excited to share this final season with you,\" they added. The Season premiere of Young Sheldon is tentatively scheduled for February 15."

The demolition, which was carried out by the Mangalagiri-Tadepalli Municipal Corporation (MTMC) using excavators and bulldozers, began after a notice from the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) citing unauthorised construction to be the reason behind the action. The demolition continued even though the YSRCP, which is now in the opposition, sought legal intervention, claiming that the High Court had ordered a halt to any demolition activity.

TDP leader Pattabhi Ram Kommareddy said that the procedure was carried out as per law adding that the demolition of illegal construction has nothing to do with political vendetta. “As per the law and prevailing rules, any illegal construction needs to be demolished. Today, the party office of YSRCP which is being built illegally without obtaining any permissions from the concerned departments is being demolished as per the rules,” he added. On Jagan Reddy’s political vendetta allegation, Kommareddy said, “This has nothing to do with any kind of political vendetta as the YSRCP is alleging. First, they should answer whether the constitution which they have taken up has the required permissions or not…TDP and Nara Chandrababu Naidu have never followed the path of political vendetta.”"

According to a report by Moneycontrol , citing government sources, the discussion on boosting consumption has arisen due to the country experiencing a decline in private consumption growth, which stands at approximately 4 percent — the lowest in 20 years excluding the pandemic year. This is in contrast to a robust GDP growth rate of 8.2 percent in FY24, outperforming global benchmarks. Tax Limit To Rs 5 Lakh According to one official, the government is planning to raise the income threshold for tax liability from the current Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh in the forthcoming budget, expected to be unveiled in mid-July. This adjustment is intended exclusively for taxpayers under the new regime, aiming to increase disposable income, especially among lower-income groups. According to the report, a definitive decision on this matter will be made closer to the budget presentation. According to another official speaking to Moneycontrol , the Centre is unlikely to consider industry requests to decrease the highest individual income tax slab rate under the new tax regime from 30 percent to 25 percent. “Changes in higher income tax slabs are unlikely because consumption boost is currently needed for lower-income people,” the official added. The government might hold off on raising the tax bracket for the highest rate (currently 30% on income above Rs 10 lakh). This could be a nudge for taxpayers to switch to the new system, which has lower rates but fewer deductions. Those who earn more than Rs 15 lakh a year fall under the highest 30-percent tax bracket in the new tax regime, while under the older regime the highest slab kicks in for earnings above Rs 10 lakh itself. According to another official, the Centre is focusing on potentially reducing personal income tax rates instead of significantly increasing expenditure on subsidies and other schemes, which are often susceptible to inefficiencies. “Tax rate cuts are a better way to boost consumption in the economy rather than splurging on welfare schemes given that such programmes are impacted by leakages to an extent, thereby leading to a situation where the benefit of the scheme sometimes fails to entirely reach those who need it the most,” this official told Moneycontrol . Recently, CII President Sanjiv Puri also highlighted that income tax relief for the people in the lowest slab may need to be considered in the upcoming full Budget considering the high levels of inflation In an interview with PTI , he said, “What we are suggesting is that the process of simplification should continue. There are certain suggestions relating to capital gains, which are different for different instruments. Can it be rationalised?” Puri further said there are some operational difficulties in TDS (tax deducted at source) and multiplicity of rates and CII would prefer simplification of these. “…over a period of time as far as customs is concerned, we should move to a three-tier structure, primarily at the lowest level, intermediates in between and then the finished goods and all over a period of time should be moderate rates with some exclusions, as deemed appropriate,” he added. In the 2020 budget, taxpayers were given a choice between two options: The old tax system lets you deduct expenses from your income for investments made under specific sections (like 80C). You can also claim exemptions for things like house rent allowance (HRA) and leave travel allowance (LTA). Under the old regime, Income tax exemption limit is applicable on income up to Rs 2.5 lakh for individuals whereas under the new regime, the exemption limit is on income up to Rs 3 lakh."

    "article_content": "Written By : Sandeep Balakrishna News18.com Last Updated: June 17, 2024, 14:07 IST New Delhi, India By 1925, Naicker decided that Mohandas Gandhi had proven to be an insurmountable roadblock in his unstoppable march towards unhinged Dravidianism. (Image: Twitter) One of the first casualties of Sanskrit learning in Tamil Nadu was a traditional Gurukulam located in the ancient Kallidaikurchi Agraharam falling under the jurisdiction of the Tirunelveli district. It was situated on the banks of the sacred Tamraparni river sanctified by countless generations of Vedic scholarship and whose glories the 19th-century Carnatic music composer, singer and saint, Muthuswami Dikshitar never tired of singing. Kallidaikurichi is just 70 km from Kanyakumari. And Kanyakumari is today a Christian-majority city. Around 1920-22, the Dravidian goon squad (mentioned in the previous part of this series) rudely descended on Kallidaikurchi on the pretext of raising an objection to the funds allocated for the Sanskrit College therein. The squad was led by E.V. Ramaswami Naicker and his trusted lieutenant, P. Varadarajulu Naidu. Through a series of relentless, pitched agitations lasting about three years, Varadarajulu Naidu exhorted the non-Brahmins as follows: “[the Gurukulam] is a direct challenge to the non-Brahmins and…this is the time for the pure Tamilians to vindicate their honour!” Naidu then embarked on a blitzkrieg of such incendiary speeches against Brahmins in his statewide campaigns. His campaign stops included Tirunelveli, Mayavaram, Salem and other important cities and towns. The outcome was entirely along expected lines: violent street riots broke out wherever he went, and the Brahmin community ultimately came to the negotiating table. The maiden victim of the negotiation was V.V.S. Aiyer, the head of the Kallidaikurichi Gurukulam, who resigned. With that, E.V. Ramaswami Naicker and his Dravidian ‘warriors’ had tasted blood. By 1925, Naicker decided that Mohandas Gandhi had proven to be an insurmountable roadblock in his unstoppable march towards unhinged Dravidianism. He quit the Congress and formed his own organisation of Dravidian stormtroopers. Around this time, the ‘supreme’ status of the Tamil language had acquired almost unchallengeable proportions. Throughout the Tamil-speaking regions, feverish efforts were underway to invent a new political vocabulary, which was to be “purely Tamil” — i.e., completely shorn of any Sanskrit influence. In hindsight, it appears that scores of eminent men in public and academic life of that period had completely fallen for this dubious theory. Among the more high-profile victims who fell for this Tamil supremacy hoax was the former Diwan of Mysore, V.P. Madhava Rao. Here is how the scholar Irschick describes it: “At a Madras Congress Provincial Conference held at Cuddalore in 1917, V. P. Madhava Rao, a Maharashtrian Brahman from Tanjore, pointed out that those who had spoken in Tamil at the meeting had demonstrated conclusively ‘the capacity of the Tamil language for the expression of ideas connected with administration, with law, and politics’.” From one perspective, it was the need of the hour to develop a native political vocabulary as a means to rouse the masses against the alien British rule. However, in the context of Tamil Nadu, this vocabulary would mean handing over ammunition to linguistic and racial separatism for which there was no basis in India’s history. This is precisely what the likes of V.P. Madhava Rao did when he gave his endorsement to an alleged Tamil linguistic superiority. The other notable name was that of “Right Honourable” V.S. Srinivasa Sastri who eventually capitulated to the demands of Tamil linguistic chauvinism. Exactly a year later, Varadarajulu Naidu launched another multi-city political tour. We can again turn to Irschick for what occurred next: “Varadarajulu Naidu [in his political tour]… used only Tamil, and he effectively proved how valuable it could be as a political tool. At Negapatam [Nagapattinam], his first triumph, he attracted a huge crowd of workers from the railway shops. At Madura he spoke to millworkers — so vigorously, in fact, that he was arrested. He was convicted on the evidence of shorthand transcripts of his Tamil speeches…” Meanwhile, in the same year that Ramaswami Naicker established his own political front, a Tamil scholar named M.S. Purnalingam Pillai, who was also secretary of the Tamil University Committee, “moved at a Justice [Party] Confederation in December 1925, that the government should…grant to the Tamil districts a university to encourage the ‘growth of the Tamil language’, as well as the development of ‘historical consciousness among Tamilians’”. His chorus was joined by T.N. Sivagnanam Pillai (Justice Minister of Development), who also demanded a separate Tamil University and alleged that Madras University was insulting Tamil by concentrating on Sanskrit, over which the “Aryas-Brahmins” held a monopoly. To be sure, the demand for a separate Tamil University was as old as 1916. After sustained activism, the university was established largely due to the decisive largesse bestowed by Sir Annamalai Chetti. In 1929, the Annamalai University was founded in the sacred temple town of Chidambaram. However, it would still take more than two decades before the fate that befell Sanskrit learning in Thanjavur and the Kallidaikurchi Gurukulam would befall on other centres of Sanskrit learning in Tamil Nadu. It was just a question of when and not if. (To be continued) The author is the founder and chief editor, The Dharma Dispatch.

    "article_content": "Curated By : Samreen Pall News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 14:23 IST New Delhi, India The national masterplan for 2047 aims to dramatically expand India's road network. (Photo: Wikipedia) The Central Government is planning to create a new authority dedicated to the development and management of expressways, government sources told Business Today TV. This initiative is part of the Road Transport and Highways Ministry’s 100-day plan and is currently in the discussion phase. Currently, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) is responsible for national highways. However, the new expressway authority will specifically manage expressways, which require different construction and tolling systems. This move aims to enhance the focus on expressway infrastructure. Under the national masterplan for 2047, India is set to expand its transportation network significantly. The plan includes building 50,000 kilometers of access-controlled expressways, ensuring that any location is within 100-125 kilometers of an expressway. Presently, India has 2,913 kilometers of such expressways. The government expects that developing new expressways and highways will increase speeds and cut logistics costs by 3-4 percent. In addition to new greenfield expressways, there is a strong emphasis on upgrading existing highways. Highways less than two lanes wide have reduced from 30 percent in 2014 to 10 percent in 2023, with their total length shrinking from 27,517 kilometers to 14,850 kilometers. Highways with two lanes or more but less than four lanes now make up 58 percent, totaling 85,096 kilometers. Highways with four lanes or more have grown to 32 percent, up from 20 percent in 2014, now measuring 46,179 kilometers. Highways are major roads designed for general traffic, including various local and arterial roads, with multiple access points and moderate speed limits. On the other hand, expressways are high-speed, controlled-access roads with limited entry and exit points, no intersections or traffic signals, and higher speed limits, built for faster long-distance travel. The central government’s proposal for a separate expressway authority aims to meet the unique requirements of expressways and supports the broader Vision 2047 plan to enhance India’s national highway network."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Mayuresh Ganapatye News18.com Last Updated: December 18, 2023, 16:06 IST Mumbai, India Sources say Nitin Desai had picked up a loan of over Rs 100 crore from a private institution but faced difficulties in repaying it. He ended his life at ND Studios on August 2 this year. File pic/X Following the death of Bollywood set designer Nitin Desai this year, the Maharashtra government is trying to acquire his production house property ND Studios in Karjat town of Raigad district, News18 learnt on Monday. According to sources, the state government has reserved the property, where films like Slumdog Millionaire, Bajirao Mastani, and Jodhaa Akbar as well as the reality show Bigg Boss have been shot, as a ‘studio’. Right now it is under the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)’s control and will soon be set aside for auction. Started by Nitin Desai on a 52-acre land parcel in Karjat in 2005, the studio is approximately 50 km away from Mumbai. Sources say the state government feels that considering the work of Nitin Desai in Bollywood, the property should be used as a ‘studio’ even in the future. According to them, chief minister Eknath Shinde has also assented to the Maharashtra government participating in the auction process whenever it takes place. Desai was an art director, production designer, and film and television producer best known for his work in films like Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999), Lagaan (2001), Devdas (2002), Jodhaa Akbar (2008) and Prem Ratan Dhan Payo (2015). During his career spanning twenty years, he worked with directors like Ashutosh Gowarikar, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Rajkumar Hirani, and Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Cabinet minister for cultural affairs Sudhir Mungantiwar told News18, “We are trying to participate in the NCLT auction regarding the ND Studios of Nitin Desai. If our bid is successful, we will keep this property as ‘studio’ only and offer it at a reasonable rate for shooting especially for Marathi films and series.” Sources say Nitin Desai had picked up a loan of over Rs 100 crore from a private institution but faced difficulties in repaying it around 2020. The matter reached the NCLT. The four-time National Award winner ended his life at ND Studios on August 2 this year."

(Photo Credits: Instagram) Every time Tejasswi Prakash steps out for a casual appearance, it is a delightful surprise. And we have proof. Recently, fans were treated to a glimpse of the actress as she travelled around the city, and what caught everyone’s attention was her mode of transport. Tejaswwi, known for her role in Naagin 7, was spotted in an auto-rickshaw. She flaunted her million-dollar smile while simultaneously chatting with the driver. Later, she hopped into her car parked nearby. Even during her casual outing, Tejasswi Prakash managed to make fashion statements. She wore a light blue maxi dress with tie-up sleeves, an A-line silhouette and a sweetheart neckline. The television star effortlessly pulled off a natural look. Check it out: A post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani) It was just a few weeks back when Tejasswi announced a break from TV. In an interview with Bombay Times, she expressed her wish to explore different mediums. She said, “I want to explore different mediums. But as they say, never say never. I have learnt from life and I have learnt the hard way. So I will not say that I will never do a TV show. After all, it made me what I am today. If you do it the right way and choose the right shows, then you will certainly get recognition. People know me but now I want that to translate into something else. So yes, I have taken a break from TV.” Besides her professional life, Tejasswi keeps hogging the limelight for her relationship with Karan Kundrra. The duo has been dating for over two years now. Their paths crossed during their appearance together in Bigg Boss 15 and have been inseparable ever since. Tejasswi was last seen in Colors TV show Naagin 6. She has also proved her versatility as an actress in Marathi films like Mann Kasturi Re and School College Ani Life. Currently, she is exploring opportunities in web series and films."

Recently, The Kapil Sharma Show star Sumona Chakravarti shared the struggle she went through to purchase her dream house. The Bade Achhe Lagte Hain actor recently shared that she managed to pay off the home loan for a “simple small apartment” in Mumbai. She described it as her “biggest achievement”. The 35-year-old actor shared that despite earning well, she had to struggle to acquire a home loan. She explained that since actors do not have a fixed income, banks hesitate to give them loans. In a conversation with the Indian Express, she said, “I still remember how the bank guys were reluctant to give me a loan because I had no fixed monthly salary. Somebody with a monthly salary of Rs 20,000 is a safer bet for a bank, than an actor, since it’s a high risk.” Sumona Chakravarti made her TV debut with the popular sitcom Kasamh Se and has been working in the entertainment industry for almost two decades now. Her hard work allowed her to book her Mumbai apartment at the age of 26, it then took her a couple of years to pay off the home loan, considering the steep real estate costs in Mumbai. She added that the COVID-19 pandemic was particularly difficult for actors who lost work and said, “As an actor when we have EMIs to pay off, it becomes a challenge sometimes, especially in a situation like Covid. So when I was able to pay off that home loan, by far that has been my biggest achievement.” Sumona Chakravarti, who will turn 36 years old on June 24, asserted that girls should first prioritise their careers and then think of marriage. She gained national fame for her decade-long stints in comedy shows helmed by comedian Kapil Sharma. She was part of the ensemble cast in shows like Comedy Nights With Kapil on Colors TV and The Kapil Sharma Show on Sony TV. Interestingly she did not join the cast of The Great Indian Kapil Sharma Show, which premiered on March 30 on Netflix. When asked about her absence from the show, she told PTI “I don’t have an answer to this.” She also added that she is busy “doing my own things, networking, and meeting people.” She will soon be seen in Khatron Ke Khiladi season 14."

I didn’t have fear, that’s why I went through…I will continue this and it’s not that you won’t get work in the industry.

He was taken into custody for 14 days and faced charges under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act which deals with buying and selling of drugs. Currently, he is out on bail.

I feel like the water is really something that calms me. I can actually sit still and stare at the ocean and at the sky. I like just being right there on the coast is beautiful and eating outside and enjoying the fresh air.

    "article_content": "Published By : Chirag Sehgal Trending Desk Last Updated: June 22, 2024, 10:58 IST Mumbai, India Karan revealed the dog walker's identity and called for action. (Photo Credits: Instagram) Recently, there has been an alarming increase in cases of cruelty and abuse towards animals, particularly pet dogs. Disturbing videos showing incidents of dog walkers, building guards and neighbours mistreating animals have surfaced online, inciting widespread anger and frustration among people. Popular TV actor Karan Patel recently spoke against one such incident in Mumbai’s Andheri, where a dog walker was observed hitting a pet Labrador. Patel expressed his strong disapproval on social media, urging the dog’s owner to take decisive action against him. On Friday, Karan Patel took to his Instagram Stories and shared a picture of the dog walker and the pet labrador. Revealing the man’s identity, he wrote, “Just saw this walker hitting this Labrador in the lane opposite Cosmopolitan College in DN Nagar. Please spread the word and help find the owner. The walker’s name is Sukhi and he seems to work for quite a few homes in the area.” “In no way will cruelty to animals be tolerated. Consequences will be severe and let’s start with his walker,” he concluded. Notably, this is not the first time that a celebrity has drawn attention to animal abuse and ill-treatment. Earlier this year, shocking footage from a vet clinic went viral where a staff member was seen mercilessly beating a pet dog. While the incident sparked widespread outrage, celebrities like Varun Dhawan, Alia Bhatt, Malaika Arora, Zoya Akhtar, Bhumi Pednekar and Jacqueline Fernandez condemned it. Voicing their concerns on social media, they demanded stricter laws against animal cruelty. The incident took place in Mumbai’s Thane. Similarly, another incident from Mumbai’s Bandra also left celebrities fuming. A viral video revealed how a female dog walker abused and thrashed a pet beagle on the footpath. As the video gained traction, actors like Alia Bhatt, Soha Ali Khan and Sophie Choudry slammed the woman and urged the owner of the dog to take strict action. Meanwhile, Karan Patel, who rose to fame with his portrayal of Raman Kumar Bhalla in the popular TV daily soap Yeh Hai Mohabbatein, has worked in a number of other shows like Kasautii Zindagii Kay, Nach Baliye 7, Jhalak Dikhhlaa Jaa 6 and Khatron Ke Khiladi 10.

    "article_content": "Published By : Chirag Sehgal Trending Desk Last Updated: June 22, 2024, 11:09 IST Mumbai, India Armaan revealed that he had married each of his wives within a week of meeting them. (Photo Credit: Instagram) The popular, controversial and fun-filled reality show, Bigg Boss OTT season 3 has officially started. Among the contestants, one has stolen the limelight and evoked everyone’s curiosity like none other. We’re talking about Armaan Malik, a YouTuber and influencer who has gained more fame for his unique family dynamic. Armaan is known for having not one but two wives, Payal Malik and Kritika Malik, and his relationship with them has often been a topic of conversation and controversy. This unusual arrangement has brought a lot of attention and speculation from the public, especially because both his wives live together under one roof and appear to have a friendly relationship with each other. Many people find this situation quite unusual and have various opinions about it. In its grand premiere, Armaan Malik made an appearance, along with his two wives, who will also be a part of the reality show. During the premiere episode of the show, Armaan made some interesting revelations about his relationships with Payal and Kritika and provided viewers with more insights into their unique family arrangement. During the show, the new host Anil Kapoor who has replaced Salman Khan this season, asked Armaan to participate in a fun game where he had to make choices between his two wives based on different scenarios. One of the questions posed to Armaan was about whom he would prefer to share a bed with. In Response, Armaan chose his first wife, Payal Malik and explained that he “finds her more romantic than Kritika Malik.” Meanwhile, when he was asked about who he wished to see as the winner of Bigg Boss OTT this season, he chose his second wife Kritika Malik. “She has a softer heart,” he added. Further into his conversation, Armaan went on to talk about his love story with each of his wives and how the trio manages to live together. He shared that he had fallen in love with Payal within days. To everyone’s surprise, he revealed that it took just seven for them to tie the knot. The story of how Kritika became Armaan’s second wife is equally interesting. According to Armaan, Kritika was initially a friend of Payal and had come to their house for their son’s birthday party. She had plans to travel to another city but those plans fell through and she ended up staying at Armaan’s house for a longer period of time. During this time, Armaan and Kritika developed feelings for each other. Similar to his first marriage, Armaan and Kritika’s relationship progressed quickly, and they got married within six days. He further explained that when he shared the news of his second marriage with his first wife Payal, she found it difficult to accept initially. However, over time, she came to terms with it, and now, all three of them live together."

With the Anil Kapoor-hosted show now underway, the contestants are expected to make things even more interesting. YouTuber Armaan Malik has also entered the house with his two wives, Payal and Kritika, only to invite extreme backlash on social media. While fans are disappointed by the makers for promoting “polygamy” on Indian television, TV actress Devoleena Bhattacharjee has now also come forward to strongly condemn the trio’s participation. However, she refrained from directly naming the contestants. In a long post on X, the ex-Bigg Boss contestant and actress, Devoleena Bhattacharjee, lashed out at the makers for sending the wrong message and showing “filth” in the name of entertainment. “Do you think this is entertainment? This is not entertainment, it’s filth. Don’t make the mistake of taking this lightly because it’s not just a reel, it’s real. I mean, I can’t even understand how anyone can call this shamelessness entertainment. I feel disgusted just hearing about it. Gross.

Discussing the significance of the Special Marriage Act and the Uniform Civil Code, Devoleena also questioned the supporters of the content creators. “The thought itself is so cringe. And if it’s so necessary to have 2-3 marriages then do it and stay at home. Don’t spread this filthy mindset to the world. As a society, we are only heading towards destruction. Truly people have gone mad. And Bigg Boss, I don’t know what has happened to you,” her post concluded. Fans instantly came out in her support, agreeing with her remarks on the Bigg Boss OTT contestants. On the other hand, another TV celebrity, Karan Kundrra was also seen taking a dig at Armaan Malik and his wives. “Armaan Malik is here with his trio, which means Armaan Malik and his two wives have entered the Bigg Boss OTT house. We will see Kalesh Pro Max in a few days. Wait for it,” he says in a video. A post shared by Telly Reporter (@tellyreporter) Armaan Malik Enters Bigg Boss OTT 3 With Two Wives YouTuber Armaan Malik entered the controversial reality show with his wives, Payal Malik and Kritika Malik, leaving many bewildered. At the premiere night, he opened up about his love story, revealing how he first married Payal in 2011 and then Kritika in 2018 without legally ending his first marriage. While their pairing is expected to bring a lot of drama to the house, contestants like Ranvir Shorey, Shivani Kumari, Sai Ketan Rao, Chandrika Dixit and others have also joined the show this year."

During a conversation with Deepak Chaurasia, a senior journalist who also entered the BB house, Sai Ketan poured out his heart and was visibly in tears. While talking to Deepak Chaurasia, Sai revealed that he started his journey in Hyderabad, to which the former asked, “Rao means you are from Hyderabad.” Stating that ‘Rao’ in his name has a different story, the actor shared, “Legally on paper, in license, it is Sai Ketan Khadse.” He further revealed that his father is from Maharashtra and his mother is Telugu. “My father was never there in my life. He is there, alive. But he left us in our childhood. I have very few people in my life including my other, my sister, and a best friend,” he added while breaking down in tears. #SaiKetanRao bursts out in tears 😭The morning at the Bigg Boss house was far from peaceful.

However, my mother told me to study properly to become an actor, and I obliged her. My family has no connections with the film industry. I come from a middle-class family, and our situation was also very bad back then. I did a short film and got Rs 100 for playing the lead hero’s brother. Then COVID happened, and it was very difficult for us. I lost my money and a lot of opportunities.” The actor then revealed how he received a call from a casting director for a character who can speak two languages. “I gave the audition with 400–500 other guys. Only 7 were selected, and I felt like I wouldn’t make it to the list. After a month, I received a call to confirm my selection as the lead actor. That was a heart-touching moment for me,” Sai shared. The actor rose to fame with his 2021 Hindi daily soap, Mehendi Hai Rachne Waali, opposite Shivangi Khedkar. He was later seen in shows like Chashni and Imlie."

Recently, the two celebrated their son Ruhaan’s first birthday. Offering a glimpse of the joyous celebration, both Dipika and Shoaib uploaded videos on their YouTube channels. In Shoaib Ibrahim’s latest vlog, his mother was seen praising Dipika Kakar for the way she has managed the family and Ruhaan. She said, “Ever since Ruhaan was born, it has been a big thing to take care of him, to take care of the house, to do everything. All the hard work that she has put in, I have seen it. Bohot samajhdaar hai meri bahu Mujhe naaz hai ispe, fakr hai. Meri bahu bahut achhi hai. (My daughter-in-law is very intelligent, I am proud of my daughter-in-law).” We can see happy tearns rolling down Dipika Kakar’s cheeks. Later, Dipika Kakar and her mother-in-law share a warm hug and said, “Main bohot khush hun, bohot achi hai ye (I am very happy, she is very good).” Adding to this, Shoiab Ibrahim said, “It is not that other mothers don’t take care of their children and don’t do all the things. The way Dipika for a whole year during pregnancy and mostly after that… because in pregnancy, sometimes you don’t understand so much, you don’t know. Yes, internal things, complications or problems, hormones change, that happens. But when the baby is delivered, after that, not getting sleep, body changes, hiccups, postpartum, all those things that happen and after that, I always tell her that it’s not like that, that today we have this privilege. Like Dipika always says, ‘I have the privilege of being able to stay at home. I was able to choose.’ There are many women, who don’t have any choice. They have to go to work.” “But even after having that privilege and after having such a successful career, after reaching its peak, Dipika Kakar decided not to work for 2-3 years, saying she would only take care of Ruhaan, I think I have seen this in very few people today. I used to feel proud of her and I still feel very proud of her. The way she handled Ruhaan without putting me under pressure… I think it’s a duty of a husband, that we can only do this much that we can support our wife during that period. We can motivate them,” he added. Dipika Kakar and Shoaib Ibrahim first met on the sets of the show Sasural Simar Ka and eventually, their love blossomed and the duo got married in February 2018. They welcomed Ruhaan last year in June. On the professional front, Dipika Kakar was last seen in the 2020 TV show Kahan Hum Kahan Tum. She also emerged as the winner of Bigg Boss Season 12. Shoaib Ibrahim, on the other hand, was recently seen in the dance reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 11, where he finished as the first runner-up."

(Image: Representative) Indian Railways operates on a unique principle when it comes to seat bookings, all in the name of passenger safety and stability. Unlike a stationary theater hall, a moving train requires careful distribution of weight to ensure smooth operation and reduce the risk of accidents. Each train comprises multiple coaches, typically with 72 seats per coach. When you book a ticket, the system strategically assigns seats starting from the middle of the train towards the ends. This method ensures a balanced distribution of weight, crucial for minimizing risks like derailment and ensuring smooth travel through curves and stops. According to DNA India, this meticulous planning isn’t arbitrary. It’s essential for maintaining equilibrium as the train moves, especially around curves or when braking. Uneven weight distribution could lead to instability, potentially endangering passengers. Explaining the system, a spokesperson highlighted, “Random seat allocation could result in some coaches being significantly heavier or lighter than others. This imbalance increases safety concerns during acceleration, deceleration, and turns.” Every booking made through IRCTC plays a role in achieving this goal. By spreading passenger loads evenly, Indian Railways minimizes risks and enhances the safety and comfort of every journey. So, the next time you find yourself allocated an unexpected seat on an Indian train, remember that it’s not by chance. It’s a strategic move by Indian Railways to maintain equilibrium within each coach and across the entire train, prioritizing passenger safety above all else."

(Photo: India Today) An 18-kilometer underground tunnel road is about to be built in Bengaluru , also referred to as India’s Silicon Valley, bringing an end to the city’s bad traffic. According to reports, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) programme intends to ease the city’s chronic traffic congestion, which is aggravated during the monsoon and festive seasons due to inadequate infrastructure and public transport. As per BBMP sources, the underground tunnel is expected to be completed by January 1, 2025, at an estimated cost of about Rs 8,100 crore, or about Rs 450 crore per km. The tunnel, which would run from the Esteem Mall in Hebbal in north Bengaluru to the Central Silk Board intersection in the south, will include additional entry and exit locations strategically placed around the city. This network will offer seamless communication, decreasing the current journey time between Hebbal and Central Silk Board from over an hour to just 20-25 minutes, according to reports. Furthermore, the Karnataka State Reserve Police (KSRP) quarters at Central Silk Board in Lalbagh, the Bangalore Golf Club, Palace Grounds, and adjacent government land near Esteem Mall in Hebbal are all important entry and exit points. The tunnel, which stands 10 metres tall, will allow vehicles to travel at speeds ranging from 40 to 60 kilometres per hour. Notably, a user fee will be established for maintenance purposes, however, the exact amount is unknown at this time. “According to our feasibility report, there are 15 congestion points between Hebbal Esteem Mall and Central Silk Board Junction that diagonally move inside the city. So, to control this, the best alternative is a tunnel road,” BBMP Chief Engineer BS Prahalad said as quoted by India Today. Currently, Bengaluru’s traffic congestion is partly due to its quickly rising population. “The other alternative could have been the construction of elevated corridors, but that would involve way more felling of trees, land acquisition, and most importantly, traffic would be disrupted for the next 3–4 years,” BBMP Chief Engineer Prahalad added. He went on to explain “So the best economic alternative that is long-lasting and scientifically proven is tunnel road construction.”"

(Photo: Car&Bike) Luxury carmaker Automobili Pininfarina is working on a new SUV that might become the world’s most expensive, with a price range between €400,000 and €1 million. This new model will outshine the Ferrari Purosangue, which costs around €380,000. Owned by Mahindra, Automobili Pininfarina is famous for its rare and high-performance cars. Their electric Battista supercar, limited to just 150 units, boasts an impressive 1,900 bhp and a top speed over 402 km/h, making it the most powerful Italian supercar ever made. CEO Paolo Dellacha recently confirmed to Bloomberg that the company is developing this new SUV. He stated it will combine sports car performance with everyday usability. “We aim to enter a segment with higher production numbers while maintaining our exclusivity,” said Dellacha. According to Hindustan Times, currently, the Battista’s production is limited to 25 units per year. However, the new SUV is expected to increase production while still being a rare luxury item. While the Battista focuses on electric technology, Dellacha mentioned that future models might explore different technologies and segments.

(Photo: Autocar) Bangalore-based Ola Electric has confirmed the launch of its first E-Motorcycle in 2026. In the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) for its upcoming IPO, the company expects to start the delivery of electric motorcycles in the first half of the financial year 2026. Ola introduced four concept E-Motorbikes – Diamondhead, Adventure, Roadster and Cruiser– in August 2023. “We plan to further expand our product portfolio to also cover mass-market motorcycles, targeting a wider range of consumers across various product types and price points in the long term,” the company said. Ola Electric has also recently filed patents for three electric motorcycle designs including a removable electric battery. “Limited options have restricted EV penetration in the motorcycle segment to less than 1 per cent, with a significant presence of EVs in over Rs 1 lakh price segment. With the strengthening of supply in popular price segments through R&D and technological advancements, penetration in the electric motorcycle segment is also expected to see an uptick,” the company added. Ola, which is one of the key players in the electric two-wheeler segment, controls over 30 percent market share. The company offers a diverse lineup of electric scooters, including the S1 Pro, S1 Air and the S1X. The S1 X is available in three different battery capacities from 2kWh to 4kWh. In April this year, the company revised the price range of their electric S1 scooter series. The prices of S1 X, offered in three battery options– 2 kWh, 3 kWh, and 4 kWh, were dropped to Rs 69,999 (introductory price), Rs 84,999, and Rs 99,999, respectively. “We believe India’s EV industry has reached an inflexion point with the EV penetration in the 2W segment at an all-time high last month. Our S1X portfolio now addresses the high upfront cost of EVs which is one of the major barriers to EV adoption,” Ola Electric’s spokesperson said while commenting on the price cut Ola Ectric competes with companies like Bajaj Auto, TVS Motors and Ather in the electric two-wheeler segment in India."

(Photo: Wikipedia) Paving the way for completion of the Joka-Esplanade metro railway project, the Calcutta High Court on Thursday dismissed a writ petition, which sought a stop to all construction by the Metro Rail authorities in the Maidan area here over environmental concerns. Permitting Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RVNL) to proceed with the project, a division bench presided by Chief Justice T S Sivagnanam dismissed the petition that prayed for an order to stop the construction of the Joka-Esplanade metro project in the Maidan area, adjoining the iconic Victoria Memorial. The bench, also comprising Justice Hiranmay Bhattacharyya, said in the judgement delivered on Thursday it is “fully convinced” that requisite permission has been obtained by RVNL for the purpose of transplantation/felling of trees. Observing that such permission cannot be stated to be either arbitrary or unreasonable as those are subject to certain stringent conditions, the court said the petitioner has not made out any case to interfere with the implementation of the project in question. The 16.7-km Joka-Esplanade metro project will have a 5.05-km underground stretch from Khidirpur to Esplanade, an official said. The Metro Rail stated before the court that the Railway Board changed the scheme of metro construction in the Maidan area, considered to be the lung of Kolkata, from viaduct to underground to maintain its ecology and skyline, despite incurring five times more cost for construction. The petitioner, an NGO, had expressed apprehension that the expression “transplant” is being euphemistically used when in reality trees will be felled, as transplanting such ancient and enormous trees was almost impossible and the survival rate likely to be negligible. Construction work for the proposed Victoria Metro Station has already commenced, and a part of the Maidan near the Victoria Memorial was cordoned off and machinery brought in. The Metro Rail told the court that for construction of underground metro, including three stations – Victoria Memorial, Park Street and Esplanade – within the Maidan area, modification of the scheme from viaduct to underground was approved by the Railway Board to avoid any effect to the surface features and for transplantation and plantation of trees. The Joka-Esplanade metro project is partially operational between Joka and Majerhat stations in the south-western suburbs of Kolkata. Completion of the project will provide an important and time-saving connectivity option to people from these places to the heart of the city."

(Photo: Cartoq) Actress Mandira Bedi has added a Volvo C40 Recharge Electric SUV to her garage. Volvo’s C40 Recharge is essentially an XC40 Recharge revamped with a coupe-like design. Announcing the news through an Instagram video, the actress wrote, “We have had an EV for 4 years.. and that’s the way forward.. but this one, I am THRILLED to have as a part of our lives!!!! Safest car on the roads and what more could a Mum want for her kids and herself!” The video shows Mandira, along with her kids, taking the delivery of the new car. A post shared by Mandira Bedi (@mandirabedi) The Volvo C40 Recharge comes packed with a dual motor setup powered by a 78kWh Lithium-ion battery pack. The two electric motors are tuned to churn 402 bhp and 660 Nm of peak torque. The car can go from 0-100kmph in just 4.7 seconds and further to a top speed of 180 Km/h. The midsize SUV gets a 9-inch Android-based display touchscreen infotainment system, 12.3-inch digital instrumental console, slip AC wents, Wood inlays on the dashboard, Dual-zone climate control and a panoramic sunroof. The car is equipped with wireless charging, heated and ventilated front seats, vegan interiors and more. Volvo C40 Recharge’s battery can be juiced up from 10 to 80 per cent in 27 minutes using a DC fast charger. It takes roughly 8 hours to fully charge the car with an 11Kw Level 2 AC Charger. Volvo claims the SUV can go up to 530 Km on a single charge. On the outside, the C40 Recharge looks similar to the previously launched XC40 Recharge. It features the same LED headlights with Thor-hammer inlays and 19-inch alloy wheels. The back of the SUV, however, gives it a distinct look. It has been altered to include a sloping roofline, vertical taillamps, a gloss black spoiler contrasting with the body colour, and plastic cladding on the rear bumper. Other features of the car include a 360-degree camera, ADAS features such as rear cross-traffic alert with brake function, a blind-spot monitor and adaptive cruise control. Currently, it competes with several e-SUVs available in the market including the BMW iX1, Kia EV 6 and Hyundai Ioniq 5. Soon it will also compete with the Mercedes-Benz EQA SUV and the new-gen MINI Countrymen E, both of which are expected to arrive soon. Volvo C40 Recharge is priced at Rs 62.95 lakh (ex-showroom), which is approx. Rs 4.35 lakh more than the XC40 Recharge."

Patna Metro, the foundation of which was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 17, 2019, is currently under construction. In a cabinet meeting chaired by Kumar, approval was given to metro projects in Muzaffarpur, Gaya, Darbhanga and Bhagalpur. “The state cabinet approved the Urban Development and Housing Department’s proposal pertaining to metro rail projects in Muzaffarpur, Gaya, Darbhanga and Bhagalpur. Now, the feasibility reports will be prepared after which the detailed project reports (DPR) will be finalised,” S Siddharth, Additional Chief Secretary (Cabinet Secretariat), told reporters after the cabinet meeting. While the central and state government will each bear 20 per cent cost of the project, the remaining 60 per cent will be borne by financial institutions, he said. In the first phase of Patna Metro, five stations are expected to be operational by March next year. The first phase will have 15.36 km of elevated track and 16.30 km of underground track. The cabinet also gave its approval to the proposal moved by the General Administration Department (GAD) authorising different commissions, including Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) and Bihar Staff Selection Commission (BSSC), to conduct preliminary examinations of different recruitment exams in two phases, if appearing students are in large number. “It will be entirely up to the commissions to hold preliminary examinations of different recruitment exams in two stages, if the number of appearing candidates is large. However, other than preliminary exams, all further examinations will be conducted on a specific date in Patna and surrounding areas,” he said. “The cabinet also gave its go-ahead to conduct these examinations in both online and offline modes,” he added.

(File photo) Indian Railways on Thursday successfully conducted a trial run of a eight-coach MEMU train on the world’s highest railway bridge — Chenab Bridge — in Jammu and Kashmir, paving the way for the start of rail service on the route from Reasi to Baramulla in Kashmir. “After an extensive inspection of the newly constructed Chenab Bridge by senior officers from Railway Board, Northern Railway and Konkan Railway, a trial run was conducted on a 46-km-long electrified line section between Sangaldan in Ramban district and Reasi at a speed of 40 kmph,” the Railway Ministry said in a statement. “It was successfully carried out starting at 12:35 pm from Sangaldan and reaching Reasi at 2:05 pm. On the way it passes through nine tunnels with a combined length of 40.787 km and longest tunnel T-44 of 11.13 km,” it added. According to the ministry, it was the first ever full train that crossed over the iconic bridge between Dugga and Bakkal stations across the Chenab river, which is the world’s highest arch railway bridge. The stations — Reasi, Bakkal, Dugga and Sawlakote — are situated in Reasi district of J&K. “The electrification work on this section has been executed with state-of-the-art technology, ROCS (Rigid Overhead Conductor System) at 25 kV, for the first time on railways,” the ministry said. Upon the mainline electric multiple unit (MEMU) train’s arrival at Reasi railway station, chants of ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ echoed as a large crowd gathered there to witness the historic event. The train carried employees working on the project as well as railway officials. Phase I of the project, covering the 118 km long Qazigund-Baramulla section, was inaugurated in October 2009 under the Congress-led UPA govt. Subsequent phases saw the inauguration of the 18 km long Banihal-Qazigund section in June 2013 and the 25 km Udhampur-Katra section in July 2014. In February 2024, the first electric train trial run from Banihal to Khari to Sangaldan section on the Banihal-Katra section of the USBRL project in Ramban was successfully conducted on around 40 km of track and tunnels between Banihal and Sangaldan railway stations in Ramban district. “After conduction of a series of such tests, this bridge would be open to run all train services which will be a monumental stride towards the seamless integration of the Kashmir valley with Jammu and the broader Indian landscape,” the ministry said. It added, “This would foster social integration by facilitating easier movement of people and goods, thereby promoting cultural exchanges and regional development and boost to economic activities such as tourism and trade.” With aim to provide an alternative and a reliable transportation system to Jammu and Kashmir, the Indian Railways has successfully laid a 272-km-long railway line from Udhampur to Baramulla joining the Kashmir valley with the rail network under the USBRL project. In view of importance of USBRL project in providing seamless and hassle-free connectivity, the Project was declared as “National Project” in 2002. The USBRL Project involves 38 Tunnels (combined length of 119Km), the longest Tunnel (T-49) is having a length of 12.75 Km and is country’s longest transportation tunnel. There are 927 bridges (combined length of 13 Km). These bridges include the iconic Chenab Bridge (Overall length 1315 m, Arch span of 467 m and height of 359 m above river bed) which is around 35 metres taller than the Eiffel Tower and is pegged to be the World’s highest arch railway bridge.

(File photo) Vande Metro trains will run between Indore and Ujjain cities ahead of the Simhastha Kumbh Mela, slated to be held in Ujjain in 2028. A decision about laying the metro track between Indore and Ujjain was taken at a meeting chaired by Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav on Saturday. Yadav said the state government would initiate important steps considering a new traffic plan for big cities in MP. “The most important decision in this direction is to operate a metro train between Indore and Ujjain, which will also be useful for the convenience of movement of devotees in Simhastha 2028,” he said. The report of the feasibility survey related to running the metro trains between these two cities has been received, he said. Yadav also said a Vande Metro service will be launched from Indore airport to Mahakal temple in Ujjain in future, which will be an important gift for the people, tourists, and devotees. In a recent discussion with Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, it has been agreed to introduce the Vande Metro Circle Train in various cities across Madhya Pradesh, providing a significant boost to urban transportation, Yadav added. “The Vande Metro Circle Train will replace the old Metro system, offering a substantial benefit to the citizens,” stated Yadav. In cities experiencing increasing traffic congestion, the Circle Train facility aims to create an integrated plan for Metro train operations. Yadav highlighted his discussions with the Railway Minister, focusing on the operation of Vande Metro trains at speeds surpassing traditional metro trains, the incorporation of state-of-the-art technology, and the potential advantages for industrial areas such as Pithampur and Dewas. Regarding the use of narrow-gauge and other existing railway lines in some cities, Yadav emphasised the need for comprehensive surveys and studies. This will ensure that currently unused rail tracks can be repurposed effectively. The meeting also reviewed the progress of the metro projects in the state. The trial run of the first phase of the Bhopal metro was completed in October last year, with the second and third phases set for completion by 2027.

Ahead of the official launch, the vehicle has been spied on during the testing phase. The company termed it as an Intelligent Crossover Utility Vehicle (CUV). It has been reported that the battery-powered model is likely to arrive in the country somewhere in the festive season. However, the company is yet to share the official details.

It is expected to come with a fully LED headlight setup, paired with LED DRLs and integrated turn indicators. On the side, it will get a charging socket as seen in the spy images, and might offer a decent size cladding. As the vehicle was seen fully covered with heavy camouflage, it was very hard to analyse the wheel design. When it comes to the rear, a spoiler will be there to make it look more appealing in the segment. Customers can expect full LED treatment as well with a sweet touch of chrome at the back. From inside, it shows a flat-bottom multi-functional steering wheel with mounted controls. For entertainment purposes, there will be a large-sized free-standing touchscreen infotainment screen. The unit is expected to support all car connect technology including Android, Apple and Auto Carplay. The other notable features include a wireless charging pad, electronic parking brake, circular rear AC vents, 360-degree camera, parking sensors at both ends and others. As far as the powertrain is concerned, it might use the same battery setup as the ZS EV. It means the model might feature a 50 kWh battery, which will offer an impressive range of around 500 km on a single charge."

(Representational Image) (Photo: Curly Tales) Starting July 1, the entire Bengaluru-Mysuru Road network will be equipped with the Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS), according to Alok Kumar, ADGP for Traffic and Road Safety in Karnataka. The ITMS, first launched in Bengaluru in December 2022, includes 250 automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras and 80 red light violation detection (RLVD) cameras at 50 key junctions. This technology helps in detecting traffic violations and improving road safety. The ITMS has now expanded to Mysuru with ANPR cameras installed on major roads at a cost of Rs 8.5 crore. Mysuru city received Rs 4 crore, and the district region received Rs 4.5 crore. From July 1, traffic violators in Mysuru will start receiving challans. “The cameras will monitor several areas including Hunsur, HD Kote, Nanjangud, and T Narasipur. We have set up a Traffic Management Centre in Mysuru, and will soon start sending real-time SMS alerts to violators,” said Alok Kumar to Deccan Herald. The ADGP also plans to extend ITMS to four major highways connecting Bengaluru: Tumakuru Road (NH 4), Kanakapura Road (NH 948), Hosur Road (NH 44), and NH 75. These highways will also feature Variable Messaging Signs (VMS) to inform drivers about real-time traffic conditions and road events. More cameras and VMS boards are also planned for the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway. The state road transport authority has approved the proposal, and tenders will be issued in July. In a meeting on June 1, the state police’s traffic and road safety wing discussed integrating the challan system with FASTag at toll gates. This would enable direct deduction of traffic fines from the FASTag wallet. The ADGP plans to write to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) for approval. Alongside cameras, the police are investing in signboards, blinkers, 800 alcometers for checking drunk driving, and 155 laser speed guns to enhance road safety across Karnataka, excluding Bengaluru."

(Representative Image) The New Delhi Metro station is all set to emerge as a triple interchange facility with the expansion of the Green Line from Inderlok to Indraprastha, officials said on Sunday. The 12.37 km long Inderlok – Indraprastha corridor will expand the already operational Brigadier Hoshiar Singh – Inderlok Green Line corridor (28.78 km), they said. On this new extension, the New Delhi station will be expanded as an interchange facility where three lines – Yellow, Orange (Airport Line), and now the Green Line will meet each other, the officials said.

This will make access to the New Delhi station more convenient and help decrease congestion near the station as more people will prefer to travel by metro than by road, they said. Like the existing New Delhi station, the new expansion for the Green Line shall also be underground. Presently, Kashmere Gate is the only triple interchange station on the Delhi Metro network where the Yellow, Red, and Violet lines meet. After Phase 4, three more stations, Lajpat Nagar, Azadpur and New Delhi will also emerge as triple interchange facilities, they said. Currently, about 86 kilometres of new lines are being constructed as part of the Delhi Metro’s Phase 4 expansion. Construction of three lines – Janakpuri West – RK Ashram Marg (Violet), Majlis Park – Maujpur (Pink) and Aerocity – Tughlakabad (Golden) is in progress right now, and over 50 per cent of civil work has been completed on these sections, the officials said. Two more corridors — Inderlok – Indraprastha and Saket G Block – Lajpat Nagar — have also received approval earlier this year. The DMRC at present, is processing for statutory clearances, including land taking over from DDA, CPWD and PWD and forest clearance requirements, they said.

    "article_content": "Curated By : Samreen Pall News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 12:03 IST Chennai, India This initiative is geared towards improving last-mile connectivity for commuters. (Photo: Deccan Herald) Private bus operators have rolled out shuttle van services from key locations like Vadapalani, Velachery, Pallavaram, and Sholinganallur to the new Kilambakkam bus terminus. This move comes in response to the upcoming deadline that will ban buses from entering city roads, aiming to improve last-mile connectivity for passengers. According to TOI, once the new parking lot is ready, all private buses will be prohibited from city roads. Explaining the decision, R Barathidasan, a private bus operator, said, “With the end of summer vacation and no upcoming festivals, fewer people are using private buses. To compete with the 1,600 buses going to destinations like Madurai and Coimbatore, we’re offering shuttle vans from main pick-up points at no extra cost. It takes about two hours to reach Kilambakkam due to traffic, so we’ve adjusted our bus schedules.” Passengers appreciate the new service. R Chidambaram, a frequent traveler, commented, “The shuttle vans are convenient for both departure and return to Chennai. Although the government says there are enough MTC buses from Kilambakkam to the city, we have to cross a busy highway and walk a kilometer to reach them. The shuttle vans drop us off at places like Tambaram, Kathipara, and Vadapalani, which is much easier.” The introduction of shuttle vans comes amid ongoing challenges with private buses not following boarding regulations. Despite orders from the Madras High Court, buses are still blocking traffic by boarding passengers at unauthorized spots. Residents hope this issue will be resolved when all bus operations move to Kilambakkam. Anbalagan, head of the TN All Omni Bus Owners and Operators Association, mentioned that the government promised parking for all registered buses at Kilambakkam, but currently, only 110 of the required 800 spots are available. CMDA officials said 80 percent of the work at Mudichur is complete, and operations will be moved soon."

    "article_content": "Written By : Shahrukh Shah News18.com Last Updated: June 16, 2024, 13:13 IST Delhi, India BMW R1300 GS. (Photo: Shahrukh Shah/News18) After ruling the ADV segment for years with R 1250 GS, the top player BMW Motorrad is now back with something bigger and better, the all-new R 1300 GS. The model has been released in India a few days back at the price tag of Rs 20.95 lakh (ex-showroom). The company has invested some good efforts in the model and made it a completely new motorcycle, overshadowing the previous version. All credit goes to new technology, powers, capabilities, riding quality, features, and whatnot. As they say, with great power comes great responsibility. This is the current scene with newly joined member family members as a brand has high hopes for the latest offering. Recently, the team CNN-News18 Auto has tested the newly added model in the fleet and put it ordeal on the world’s toughest terrain in Leh Ladakh. In this detailed article, we will try to pen down top pointers, mentioning why R 1300 GS could be the wise choice if looking for an ADV bike under the price range between Rs 20 to Rs 21 lakh. The company has some impressive enhancements at its heart. The motorcycle now uses a robust 1300cc engine. This unit is 6.5 kg lighter as compared to the 1250 GS, reducing the overall weight. It generates an extra 8 bhp and 5 Nm more torque, making it a total of 143 bhp and 149Nm, while the redline remains unchanged at 9,000 rpm. The newly designed engine feels punchy even at the highest altitudes around 17,000 feet above sea level. The exhaust note sounds quite aggressive as compared to the 1250 GS. If you are willing to invest a huge amount in a motorcycle, why settle for ugly looks? In terms of design, the company has mastered the art and made the newly launched R 1300 GS completely treat to the eyes. It comes with all the elements, which anyone could ask for. It has been treated with a dominating stance and appealing road appearance. The latest model has ditched the company’s signature style asymmetrical headlight design. Instead, it gets an LED matrix unit with 47 LEDs on board. It helps the riders to have an illuminated path, wherever the handle moves. The latest R 1300 GS has been built on a steel chassis with an aluminum subframe, cutting an extra kilogram from the overall weight. This makes it even more easy to ride on multiple terrain. To put an extra feather to its cap, the company has included a knuckle guard at both ends with integrated turned indicators. It offers a safe and secure riding experience to the customers. It might take the whole day to explain the list of features in R 1300 GS. Let’s cut it short and talk about only some cool ones. It gets an improved 6.5-inch TFT display, allowing the rider to monitor all the bike-related information such as gear positioning, riding model, speed, RPM, fuel efficiency, and whatnot. It also has height adjustment features (only in top models), an Adaptive cruise control model, ADAS, handle heating function, electrically adjustable front wisor, traction control, and suspension damping among others. Apart from this, customers also can enjoy electrically connected panniers with charging sockets inside. It helps the riders to charge all their gadgets while on the go. Despite having an overall weight of 237 kg, it is very easy to put it on the main stand, all thanks to the Jacking it function. Once the feature is engaged, it lifts the bike from the back itself and gets the job done without asking much effort. If you have ridden the 1250 GS, the updated avatar might leave you with an open mouth as it feels less heavy and more agile with extra comfort. All the credit goes to the over 12 kg weight deduction. The Telelever Evo suspension at the front makes a more rooted no matter if it is running on bumpy roads or rough patches. The 850 mm seat is big enough to accommodate riders comfortably, and won’t hurt the back during long journeys. We feel the latest R 1300 GS has been released to serve a purpose, catering to a specific target audience. If you are someone who loves to go on an adventure and likes to ride on extreme road conditions, then it surely deserves consideration under the price range between Rs 20 lakh to Rs 21 lakh (ex-showroom). From delivering fantastic performance on rough terrains to making you feel secure during off-road challenges, the newly launched R 1300 GS tasks all the responsibility effortlessly. It has been given all the capabilities to fight against all odds."

He has many times impressed fans with his acting skills. However, recently, Nana Patekar was seen opening up about his elder son’s demise and said that he never thought what his son Durvasa was feeling. To note, he died when he was two and a half years old. Talking to Lallantop, Nana Patekar said, “My eldest son was sick since birth. He had some complications. He had trouble in one eye, it wasn’t visible. I felt so disgusted that when I saw him, I thought about what people would think, what kind of son Nana has. I didn’t think about what he felt or how he felt. I only thought about what people would think about my son. His name was Durvasa. He spent two and a half years with us. But what can you do, some things happen in life.” However, he recently also talked about Tanushree Dutta who had accused him of sexual harassment. The actress claimed he misbehaved with her during the shoot of a song for the 2008 film Horn Ok Pleassss. Nana had denied the claims at the time. In a recent interview, Nana addressed the claims yet again and said he isn’t angry with turn of events. “I knew that it was all a lie. That’s why I didn’t get angry. When everything was a lie, why should I be angry? And all those things are old. They have happened. What can we talk about them? Everyone knew the truth. What could I say at that time when nothing like this happened? Suddenly, someone says that you did this, you did that. What would I have answered to all these things? Should I have said that I didn’t do this? I know the truth that I didn’t do anything,” Nana Patekar told The Lallantop. On the professional front, the actor was part of Vivek Agnihotri’s thought-provoking drama ‘The Vaccine War’ last year, where he delivered a compelling performance. Additionally, he graced the Marathi film industry with his presence in ‘Ole Aale’, a movie that resonated well with audiences and performed impressively at the box office."

According to Sacnilk.com, the film earned Rs 1 crore net on its opening day in India. On Sunday, i.e day 3, the movie minted over Rs 1.40 crores. With this, the film’s total earnings stand at Rs 3.55 Crores. According to a report in Sacknilk, Ishq Vishk Rebound had an overall 17.69% Hindi Occupancy on Sunday, June 23, 2024. While the morning shows had 7.66% attendance, afternoon shows had 22.36%, evening shows had 25.40% and night shows had around 15.35%. News18 Showsha’s review of the film read, “The disappointing camera work bogs down the film’s viewing experience. But fortunately, the actors manage to hold our hands until the end. Ishq Vishk Rebound is out and out Rohit Saraf’s film. He is the narrator of the film. His character, Raghav, often breaks the fourth wall to talk to the audience and share his thoughts. The approach is heavily inspired from Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Emmy-award winning show Fleabag. In India, Kader Khan had done it in the 1980s with Ghar Ho Toh Aisa.” Hrithik Roshan’s cousin Pashmina has made her acting debut in the film. At the trailer launch, producer Ramesh Taurani had revealed she had auditioned for the role and had not revealed her background until her family name popped up when she was signing the contract. In an interview with News18, Dharmadhikari said that though the role was tough to cast, when he found Pashmina, he knew she was a perfect fit. Pashmina was my only choice to play Samiya, nobody else came close. In that list of shortlisted names, there was only one name when it came to Samiya,” the filmmaker said. “I think Pashmina’s character was the toughest to cast, she plays a different character. Once you see the film you will understand. Her character walks a very thin line. But I think she got it absolutely right in her audition. Pashmina herself has a very enduring quality and that worked in her favour, especially when it came to casting Samiya.” The film marks the second film in the Ishq Vishk franchise and features four fresh faces — Pashmina Roshan, Jibraan Khan, Rohit Suresh Saraf and Naila Grrewal."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Entertainment Bureau Local News Desk Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 12:08 IST Delhi, India Salim Khan said that Salman Khan easily enters into relationships. Salman Khan has been reigning supreme as one of the biggest stars of the Indian film industry for over 30 years now. While his fans are always eager to see him on screen, one question that lingers in the mind of every fan is ‘Why is the star still unmarried at 58’. Salman’s fans have been with him through thick and thin, during a rough patch of his career before 2009 and also when he was battling several lawsuits. His fans want nothing more than to see their favourite star get married but at 58, the possibilities of Salman getting married are quite bleak. So why has the actor eluded marriage? Salman’s father Salim Khan has an interesting take on the subject. A recent video is going the rounds on the internet where veteran screenwriter Salim Khan talked about how his son Salman views marriage and why he has not taken the marital plunge to date. Salim Khan said about Salman, “He easily enters into relationships, but he lacks the courage to get married. He has a very simple nature and gets attracted easily. However, he always wonders whether the woman can manage a family like his mother does.” Salim Khan said that Salman always looks for the qualities and traits that his mother has in the women he dates. A post shared by Miss Naziya. (@naziyapatel3) Salim Khan added, “He wants the woman he marries to be dedicated to her husband and children, just like his mother was. She should cook meals for the children, help them get ready and ensure their homework is done. However, this is not easy in today’s times.” This is the reason Salman Khan has not been able to zero in on a woman to marry to date. Salman Khan has had his share of relationships and flings with actresses like Somy Ali, Sangeeta Bijlani, Aishwarya Rai and Katrina Kaif being linked to him. None of the relationships worked out, however."

She shared her thoughts during a recent interview, providing a stark contrast between the past and present eras of Bollywood. Shabana Azmi mentioned that she used to have a three-member team and when it was a low-budget film there was no one. In an interview with Hindustan Times, Shabana Azmi said, “I find it astonishing that producers pick up these crazy tabs. In Hollywood, I have never seen anything like this except for personal trainers. The main dress designer, hairdresser and makeup artiste are all appointed by the producer’s team, [and no actor needs to bring their person staff].” Shabana Azmi said that when she was working in earlier days, she used to have a three-member team. “During the 1970s and 1980s, I only had a three-member team — a hair dresser, a make up artist, and the driver. In low budget films, we had nobody. At the most the unit makeup man and hair dresser,” shares the actor, adding that in case of projects with a limited budget, “I used my own clothes , used the unit’s hair and make-up person and always stayed in the same hotel as the unit,” the actress added. Recalling the old days, the actress mentioned that she used to travel in a bus with Smita Patil when shooting for Mandi. “I remember (late actor) Smita Patil and I had been given separate cars for the shooting of Mandi. In two days, we gave them up and travelled in the bus with all the actors because they were having so much fun while singing and playing silly games!” she recounts, sharing another anecdote where she bought her director an air ticket “when I realised he was travelling by train”. Recently, Anurag Kashyap blamed producers and agencies for actors’ unreasonable demands and surge in entourage cost. He said that the surge in cost was noted after the OTT uprising. He believes the cost rose after more agencies got involved in making a star a brand and as a result, stars and their entourage are paid more than the crew that actually sits down to make a film or a series."

(Photo Credits: Instagram) English singer Charlotte Emma Aitchison, better known as Charli XCX, demonstrated the perfect example of sisterhood at her latest music show. The Good Ones singer was performing at ZIGclub in Sao Paulo, Brazil on Saturday, June 22. During her performance, some anti-Taylor Swift fans were heard chanting derogatory slogans towards the pop star. Displeased by the crowd’s behaviour, Charli XCX took a stand for Taylor Swift by posting an elaborate write-up on her Instagram Stories. She simply asked the people to “stop” attacking an artist, asserting that she would not “tolerate” misconduct. “Can the people who do this please stop? Online or at my shows. It is the opposite of what I want and it disturbs me that anyone would think there is room for this in this community. I will not tolerate it,” wrote Charli XCX. According to a report by Deadline, a certain section of the audience was heard chanting, “A Taylor morreu” in Portuguese which translates to “Taylor is dead.” When a Swiftie demanded attention to the crowd’s “toxic behaviour”, it prompted Charli XCX to defend the name of her fellow pop singer. There have been rumours of bad blood between Taylor Swift and Charlie XCX. Not long ago Charli’s fans attacked Swift for releasing a UK-exclusive digital version of her popular album The Tortured Poets Department in the same week as Charli produced her latest album Brat. Fans speculated that the album clash posed a hindrance to Charli securing a top spot on the UK’s Official Charts, claimed Variety. That was not all on the supposed rivalry between the two singing sensations. Rumours also started swirling that one of the songs from the Brat album titled Sympathy is a Knife was Charli XCX’s indirect diss at Taylor Swift. Previously, Charli hinted at how the track was inspired by a woman who tapped her “insecurities”, reported Variety. The lyrics of the song also mention someone as “George”. Interestingly, Charli is engaged to drummer George Daniel, who is a member of the pop band The 1975, and Swift used to date the band’s lead singer Matty Healy. A post shared by Charli (@charli_xcx) Despite all the claims, Charli XCX has never commented negatively on Taylor Swift. She even gave a shoutout to the Blank Space singer in 2018 calling her “one of the biggest artists” of the present generation."

(Photo credits: X) The advance booking for the much anticipated movie Kalki 2898 AD, starring Prabhas, Deepika Padukone, Kamal Haasan and Amitabh Bachchan, has begun nationwide. While excitement among the audience is sky high, the Telangana government is making headlines as they increased ticket prices and added additional screenings of the film. According to reports, the government has allowed a special 5:30 AM show on the first day at a higher rate of Rs 200 extra. On the other hand, the makers have also been granted permission to screen five shows for the first 8 days, between 27 June and 4 July, across all theatres in the state. While some are excited about the early screening, others are raising concerns and criticising the Telangana government for the inflated ticket prices. An individual from the production house confirmed the news on X. According to the permit, the government has approved Rs 75 increase for single screen theatres and Rs 100 in multiplexes across the state for regular shows. With such high ticket rates, the movie is expected to break major box office records within a week. Many shared their opinion about the impact of these prices and questioned if this is the right strategy. Others are worried about piracy, as increased prices may lead people to download the movie from illegal websites. ప్రభాస్ కల్కీ చిత్ర టికెట్ ధరల పెంపు, అదనపు షోలకు తెలంగాణ ప్రభుత్వం అనుమతిఈ నెల 27 నుంచి జులై 4 వరకు 8 రోజులపాటు టికెట్ ధరల పెంపునకు అనుమతి.సాధారణ థియేటర్లలో రూ.70, మల్టీఫ్లెక్స్ ల్లో రూ.100 పెంపునకు అనుమతి27న ఉ. 5:30 కి షో స్టార్ట్. #Prabhas #Kalki #Kalki2898AD pic.twitter.com/9Jj1W3uwOC — Suresh PRO (@SureshPRO_) June 23, 2024 Telugu movie industry is facing a tough time with early OTT releases.

He also said that he was so addicted to smoking that he used to smoke 60 cigarettes a day and also shared how he quit smoking. “At that time, I used to smoke about 60 cigarettes a day.

Shah Rukh Khan is back on top with three big hits in 2023: Pathaan, Jawan, and Dunki. Rajkumar Hirani’s film did well, but expectations were even higher. Now, there were rumors they might team up again with Samantha Prabhu. Could this be their big comeback? On Saturday, rumours started that Shah Rukh Khan and Rajkumar Hirani are planning an action-adventure-patriotic film together. Fans are excited, especially with SRK’s recent successes. Adding Samantha Prabhu to the mix had made everyone even more excited, imagining a huge hit in both Southern and Northern markets. And now, sources close to Rajkumar Hirani strongly deny the rumours, stating that Raju Sir is currently busy writing his next film. There have been no discussions with SRK or Samantha regarding any project. The source laughs off the idea of Shah Rukh Khan and Samantha collaborating for an untitled action-adventure patriotic movie as completely baseless and untrue. According to Koimoi, Rajkumar Hirani had high hopes for Dunki to be a major box office hit. Although it did well and earned 232 crores, it didn’t meet huge expectations. Rajkumar Hirani is still reflecting on Dunki’s performance and is taking time to decide on his next project. While working with Shah Rukh Khan is appealing, Hirani is searching for the perfect story. Nothing has been finalised yet. On the professional front, SRK’s next film is King, starring alongside his daughter Suhana Khan. Directed by Sujoy Ghosh, not much is known about the project, but a viral look of SRK in a new avatar has created excitement. While Suhana debuted with The Archies, King will be her first big-screen film. SRK also has Tiger vs Pathaan and a Pathaan sequel coming up. Samantha Ruth Prabhu will be seen in ‘Citadel’ with Varun Dhawan and is also working on her Telugu films. Rajkumar Hirani has created several blockbusters, such as 3 Idiots, PK, Sanju, and Munnabhai MBBS."

Kamal will be seen opposite Amitabh Bachchan, Prabhas and Deepika Padukone in the film. “I was mourning to Amit ji backstage that I always wanted to play the bad man. The bad man gets to do all the good things in films. Where the heroes are singing romantic songs and waiting for the heroine, I thought I was going to play the bad man so it is going to be fun.

(Photo: Instagram) Kalki 2898 AD is currently the most awaited film of the year. It features Amitabh Bachchan, Kamal Haasan, Prabhas and Deepika Padukone in lead roles. Following the release of the intriguing trailer recently, the cast, along with producers Swapna Dutt and Priyanka Dutt, sat for an interview and shared details about the film. During the conversation, Haasan surprised everyone by revealing his personal connection with Prabhas’ family. Kamal Haasan reminisced his time when he worked as a dance assistant for Prabhas’ late uncle, Krishnam Raju, and shared a humorous incident from those days. After confirming that the Baahubali star is a second generation artist from his family, Haasan said, “I was a dance assistant. He [Krishnam Raju] was not much of a dancer, he used to say, don’t give me this moment. He used to threaten me, take me aside during breakfast.\" During the interview, Kamal Haasan, who will play the villain Supreme Yaskin in Kalki 2898 AD, revealed what he loved the most about working on the film. He mentioned that it wasn’t about the number of cameras or the crew size, but he appreciated the peaceful atmosphere of the set. Haasan pointed out that calmness is often absent on many sets, which become a distraction. He highlighted that the noise should come from within a person or heard in theatres. “Everybody is talking in discipline. I found that Mr. Nagi (Nag Ashwin) could speak in his volume and still be heard. Nagi mumbles, but he is still heard in the set because that’s how quiet the set is,\" Kamal Haasan added. Meanwhile, the newly released trailer of Kalki 2898 AD begins with Amitabh Bachchan’s Ashwathama talking to Deepika Padukone’s character. He says that Deepika is carrying god in her womb. Shortly after, the trailer features intense fight scenes between Prabhas and Big B.

(Photo Credit: YouTube) After two weeks of release, Disney and Pixar’s Inside Out 2 continues to rage above the rest as the highest-grossing movie of the year. In its second weekend, the animated flick grossed a record-breaking $100 billion domestically along with over $164.4 million overseas to finish Sunday with more than $700 million in ticket sales. According to a Variety report, Inside Out 2 saw a slight decline of 35 per cent from its magnanimous debut, making it the best ever for an animated film. Not just that, this also marks the 7th best second weekend ever, crossing biggies like Force Awakens, Avengers: Endgame, Avengers: Infinity War, Black Panther, Jurassic World, and The Avengers. With more than $700 million at the box office, the Pixar sequel has already beaten Dune: Part Two, which generated $711 million globally. The film now inches towards the $1 billion benchmark. Additionally, Inside Out 2 brings more to the second weekend than its 2015 predecessor, which earned $90 million in the opening weekend. According to The Hollywood Reporter, its tally stands at $355 in North America, while it has raked in another $369.4 overseas, totalling approximately $724 million worldwide. With such impressive collections, the film clearly marks a win for both Disney and Pixar. While the last two Pixar releases, Elemental and Lightyear, saw mediocre sales, three prior films were directly sent to streaming platforms due to COVID-19. The film’s performance also shows a rebound for theatres, considering very few films had a good show this year. More On Inside Out 2 A direct sequel to 2015’s Inside Out, the second installment follows a teenage Riley and her newfound emotions of Anxiety, Embarrassment, Envy, and Ennui. Besides, her OG five emotions—Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust—also make a return to the film. Directed by Kelsey Mann, Inside Out 2 begins where the first part ended. The story picks up with Riley, now a teenager, who is about to go to ice skating camp, only to come across various challenges while navigating high school life and making new friends. Disney-Pixar seems to have done a commendable job by combining the extraordinary adventures with a relatable and mature coming-of-age tale. “The new characters promise to stir things up within headquarters,\" says Mann."

I use it even on rainy days when there is no sunlight. I feel that this habit helps my skin to heal and glow. I feel that everyone should use it in their daily life.” Talking about her nighttime skincare routine, Triptii said, “At Night I follow the same skincare routine. At first, I wash my skin with the same cleanser and then I apply a slightly heavier moisturiser as I help my skin to remain soft. Then I apply Retinol serum every alternate day.”"

Unki jodi salamat rahe,” he said Shatrughan continued, “44 years ago, Shatrughan Sinha married a very successful, very beautiful, very talented girl of his choice, Poonam Sinha.

A new video from Sonakshi Sinha’s wedding is going viral on social media. The heartwarming footage shows Sonakshi walking beneath a traditional ‘phoolon ka chaddar’, a canopy of flowers held up by her friends and actor Saqib Saleem, who is like a brother figure in her life. In the video, Sonakshi visibly becomes emotional as she walks up to her soulmate, Zaheer, on the big day. For those unversed, Phoolon ka chaddar in a Punjabi wedding refers to a canopy made of flowers that is held over the bride’s head as she makes her entrance. It is a traditional and symbolic element of the wedding procession, often accompanied by music and dancing, signifying the bride’s arrival and her special status on her wedding day. This canopy of flowers adds to the grandeur and auspiciousness of the occasion in Punjabi weddings. It is typically carried by female relatives or friends of the bride or brothers. Her brothers were also spotted earlier in the evening as they made their way to the venue. Check out Sonakshi’s video here: A post shared by F I L M Y G Y A N (@filmygyan) Actress Sonakshi Sinha’s family members, including her mother Poonam Sinha and brother Luv Sinha, had sparked concern ahead of her wedding with Zaheer Iqbal, following a viral post on Reddit claiming that the duo didn’t follow the ‘Heeramandi’ star on Instagram. Sonakshi had come under intense scrutiny ever since an audio invite of her wedding with Zaheer surfaced on the internet. Rumors were also circulating that her father, actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha, was allegedly upset with her for not informing him about her wedding plans. Earlier, Luv Sinha had reacted to the reports of her sister’s wedding to Zaheer Iqbal in a conversation with ETimes. Luv, who is reportedly out of the city, chose to remain tight-lipped about the matter. He told ETimes, “I’m out of Mumbai at the moment, and if it’s regarding the news published, I have no comment or involvement in the matter.”"

Photo: Viral Bhayani Sharmin Segal recently made her first appearance since the release of her debut web series Heeramandi. She arrived for her co-star Sonakshi Sinha’s wedding reception in Mumbai and was joined by her husband Aman Mehta. Sharmin looked pretty in a pristine white saree, teamed with a golden blouse. Aman on the other hand donned a maroon kurta. The couple donned their brightest smiles as the shutterbugs captured them. Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s web series Heeramandi was released on Netflix earlier this month. It soon became a talking point among audiences for its historical inaccuracies and casting choices. Sanjay Leela Bhansali and his niece, Sharmin Segal, who essays the role of Alamzeb in the series, especially bore the brunt of heavy critique by the viewers. Sharmin was recently asked if Sanjay Leela Bhansali gave her any leeway as she is his niece. Sharmin told The Indian Express, “Ulta, I don’t get any leeways. He loves me a lot, I’m not going to deny that. There are days when he’ll look at me like ‘Sharmin, his niece’ when I’m just sitting. When I look at him on a set, I don’t look at him as my uncle. I look at him as Sanjay Leela Bhansali and that’s the respect he has earned throughout his life. I can’t take that away just because I’m related to him. I also can’t change the fact that I’m related to him.” Sharmin said that when she turned 18, she rewatched Devdas and realised that “Sanjay Leela Bhansali is my mama”. She said, “I understood who the man was and my respect for him skyrocketed when I had the maturity to understand his work… Then I worked with him as an assistant and realised how much hard work he puts in. Then I worked with him as an actor and realised the genius that he is… We call him Sanjay sir, me and my sister both. Never in public do we ever call him mama.” Sharmin Segal is the daughter of Bella Bhansali Segal (Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s sister) and Deepak Segal. She plays the role of Alamzeb in the show, which boasts an ensemble cast of acclaimed actors like Manisha Koirala, Sonakshi Sinha, Richa Chadha, Shekhar Suman, Aditi Rao Hydari, Fardeen Khan and Adhyayan Suman among others. While Manisha, Sonakshi and Aditi have been getting much love and appreciation for their solid performances, Sharmin has been receiving a huge backlash for “holding the same expression” throughout the show."

However, later, Aditi revealed that they are not married but engaged. On March 28, 2024, she dropped an engagement photo with Siddharth.

D.” Siddharth also addressed secret marriage rumours during an event and clarified, “Many told me we had done this (get engaged) in secret. There’s a big difference between doing something privately with family and in secret.”"

Amid all this, Sonakshi’s dad and actor-turned-politician, Shatrughan Sinha, has reacted to her civil marriage. When asked how he was feeling on the day of his daughter’s wedding, Shatrughan told Times Now, “Yeh bhi koi poochne ki baat hai? Every father waits for this moment when his daughter is given to her chosen groom. My daughter looks most happy with Zaheer. Unki jodi salamat rahe,” he said Shatrughan continued, “44 years ago, Shatrughan Sinha married a very successful, very beautiful, very talented girl of his choice, Poonam Sinha. Now it is Sonakshi’s turn to marry the boy of her choice.” Sharing photos from their low-key wedding ceremony, the newlyweds wrote on Instagram, “On this very day, seven years back (23.06.2017) in each others eyes, we saw love in its purest form and decided to hold on to it. Today that love has guided us through all the challenges and triumphs… leading up to this moment… where with the blessings of both our families and both our gods… we are now man and wife. Here’s to love, hope and all things beautiful with each other, from now until forever. Sonakshi ♾️ Zaheer 23.06.2024.” A post shared by Sonakshi Sinha (@aslisona) Sonakshi and Zaheer dated for seven years before taking their relationship to the next level. While they got hitched in an intimate ceremony, the couple hosted a grand reception for their friends from the film industry."

    "article_content": "Written By : Sanju Verma News18.com Last Updated: June 17, 2024, 14:24 IST New Delhi, India The Modi government has the unique distinction of being voted for the third consecutive time, for the first time in 62 years, since 1962. (Reuters) As Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared the stage with world leaders at the G7 Summit in Italy, it became amply clear how India stands as the lone exception across major democracies in delivering a clear mandate to the incumbent leader and government, since Covid. The Modi government has the unique distinction of being voted for the third consecutive time, for the first time in 62 years, since 1962. Modi 3.0, by 2028, will mean that Narendra Modi will become the longest-serving elected Prime Minister of India, overtaking Nehru. In any case, Nehru was not elected but selected in his first term. Hence Modi’s three terms are unparalleled, in that sense. Better vote share in Punjab and Tamil Nadu, two states where the BJP had little presence, a seat, finally, in Kerala from Thrissur, but above all, the stellar debut of the BJP in the Odisha state assembly, with a brute majority, is a testament to Prime Minister Modi’s unrelenting popularity. In Odisha, for instance, for the first time in more than two decades, we had a national party sweeping both the Lok Sabha and the state Assembly elections. In fact, in the last six months alone, the BJP under the aegis of Modi, has managed to form a government in six states on its own merit. In Madhya Pradesh, the BJP beat 18 years of anti-incumbency. Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh have given mandate to the BJP at the state level. The last time the Congress secured 240 seats in a general election was in 1984 and the last time the Congress scored over 230 seats in a Lok Sabha Election was in 1991 when it got a tally of 232. The party ran a coalition government with 145 odd seats in 2004 and yet again with 206 seats, it ran a coalition government in 2009 too. Hence the Congress has no locus standi whatsoever, to question the BJP which standalone won 240 seats in this year’s Lok Sabha elections. And this, despite being in power for ten long years from 2014-2024. Modi’s extraordinary achievement of being elected for the third time in a row gets even bigger, when looked at in the larger global context where incumbents have seen their fortunes fading. For example, in the US, the incumbent President Donald Trump was voted out during the pandemic, in 2020. Current incumbent Joe Biden is trailing in opinion polls. In Indonesia, the incumbent coalition lost the Presidential elections in 2024 to the Great Indonesia Movement Party, better known as the Gerindra Party, by a wide margin. In Brazil, the incumbent President was voted out in 2022. In Japan, the incumbent party managed to retain power in 2021 only after twice changing its prime ministerial candidates. In the Philippines, the incumbent vice president lost the Presidential elections in 2022 to the challenger. In Germany, the ruling coalition of the former incumbent chancellor recorded the worst-ever losses in 2021, making way for a new chancellor from a third party, which then emerged as the largest party after nearly two decades. In Thailand, in the general elections of 2023, the incumbent prime minister’s party lost vote shares and seats to multiple Opposition parties. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, ahead of the general elections, the incumbent is trailing in the opinion polls. In France, the incumbent president was re-elected in 2022 after a face-off that saw no candidate getting a majority. In South Africa, the incumbent party, the ANC, lost majority in 2024 for the first time after 30 years of rule. In Colombia, the incumbent party lost the presidential elections in 2022 with the Opposition left-wing candidate winning for the first time. In South Korea, the incumbent party’s presidential candidate lost in 2022 to the Opposition party’s presidential candidate. In Spain, no single party gained a majority in the 2023 general elections after the incumbent party in power finished second, behind the Opposition party, in both seats and vote share. Speaking of the Modi 3.0 cabinet, it is a dynamic blend of both continuity and change. The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) retained its existing lineup, with Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah, Nirmala Sitharaman, and S Jaishankar holding onto their roles in defence, home, finance, and external affairs, respectively. Nitin Gadkari has also been retained as Minister of Road Transport and Highways. Prime Minister Modi will be in charge of the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, the Department of Atomic Energy, the Department of Space, all important policy issues, and all other portfolios not allocated to any minister. Regarding new appointments, former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will take on responsibilities in agriculture and rural development, while BJP President JP Nadda returns to the health ministry, a position he held in Modi 1.0. Kinjarapu Ram Mohan Naidu (TDP), Minister of Civil Aviation; Chirag Paswan (LJP), Minister of Food Processing Industries; HD Kumaraswamy (JD[S]), Minister of Heavy Industries and Minister of Steel; and Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM), Minister of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises, are some of the key alliance partners with their equally heavyweight portfolios, who figure in the Modi 3.0 cabinet. 71 ministers officially joined the Modi 3.0 cabinet. They, along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, took their oaths during an impressive swearing-in ceremony on June 9, 2024. Clearly, Modi’s third innings as Prime Minister has begun with a diverse and inclusive team representing at least 24 states and union territories across India. Uttar Pradesh, for instance, is well-represented with nine ministers in the cabinet including Rajnath Singh, Hardeep Singh Puri, Pankaj Chaudhry, Anupriya Patel, Jitin Prasad, Jayant Choudhary, B.L. Verma, Kamlesh Paswan, and S.P. Singh Baghel. Bihar too has good representation with eight ministers, reflecting the need to balance interests with allies JDU and LJP. Prominent ministers from Bihar include Chirag Paswan, Giriraj Singh, and Lalan Singh. West Bengal has two ministers, Shantanu Thakur and Sukanta Majumdar. Tamil Nadu saw L. Murugan being retained in the cabinet. From Punjab, Ravneet Singh Bittu has been appointed as a minister. The new Modi cabinet has a mix of highly experienced names and young blood too, giving it just the right touch of dynamism, political acumen and strategic genius that a coalition government should be all about. The inclusion of stalwarts like Shivraj Singh Chouhan signals a holistic embrace of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s satraps, ensuring that the party’s ideological roots are well preserved, contrary to unwanted noise about a rift between the RSS and the BJP doing the rounds in the media. Simultaneously, the appointment of leaders like Chirag Paswan underscores a practical approach to coalition politics, emphasising the need for strong alliances, young blood and a fresh approach to realpolitik. Modi 3.0 is not just about deft navigation of the emerging political terrain; it is a nuanced balance of raj dharma and coalition dharma, where PM Modi is inevitably guided by the need for political and macro-economic stability and good governance. The BJP, while undeterred in its ideological moorings, now leads a coalition that is a mosaic of varied parties. This diversity is, however, a strength and not a weakness as the allies are not united by any narrow, opportunistic motives. Chances of any discord are limited because under the visionary leadership of Modi, despite disagreements, if any, the overriding ambition and desire to work for the greater common good shall prevail. The Modi 3.0 cabinet, therefore, represents a strategic collaboration that combines political wisdom with the art of the possible. It is a coalition based on conciliation and consensus, not confrontation or compulsion, with PM Modi steering India towards a future that is both promising and aspirational. The BJP’s understanding that a government with natural allies such as the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), Janata Dal [United] (JD[U]), Jana Sena, and Janata Dal [Secular] (JDS) requires a nimble, surefooted anchor, is astute. At least 34 out of the 71 cabinet ministers have 30 years of experience, maybe more, in active politics, serving as a strong bulwark against any imminent or potential ideological dilution. Clearly, the Modi 3.0 cabinet is a testament to the BJP’s sharp foresight, with a willingness to include diverse perspectives of coalition partners, which is crucial for the stability and longevity of the government. And yet, it has the inimitable Modi stamp written all over it. This is a subtle signal that while the BJP is willing to evolve, compromise, adapt and accommodate, it does not intend to discard the ideological commitments that have been the cornerstone of its political journey, from a party of just 2 seats in the 1980s to becoming the political behemoth that it has become today, in 2024. The party’s agenda and the government’s priorities are harmoniously intertwined, with the cabinet serving as the institutional mechanism for PM Modi’s vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047. In this new cabinet, the BJP has allocated 30 berths to cabinet ministers; there are 5 ministers of state with independent charge, and 36 ministers of state, totalling 71 members. This number includes 11 ministers from NDA partners, signifying a solid 15 per cent share of cabinet berths to allies. The distribution of ministerial roles among allies like the TDP and JD(U) is a strategic move that underscores the BJP’s intent to foster a collaborative environment under the current circumstances. The number of berths given to different partners and their significance goes beyond mere numbers; it is about giving due respect to the coalition partners’ regional and national aspirations, something which a seasoned leader like Modi understands only too well. The formation of Modi 3.0, a blend of seasoned stalwarts and fresh faces, is a reflection of the BJP’s dual commitment to effective governance and rewarding the party’s loyal cadre who have risen up the ranks. Modi 3.0 has set a formidable agenda with a focus on achieving key goals within the first 100 days. This ambitious plan underlines the Modi government’s commitment to rapid development and reforms. The targets, which include making India a $5 trillion economy by 2026-27 and a developed nation by 2047, reflect a forward-looking vision that seeks to catapult India onto the world stage as an economic superpower. This delicate balance between rewarding loyalty and focusing on governance defines Modi 3.0, setting the stage for a tenure that is as much about fulfilling the party’s ideological commitments as it is about steering the nation toward its developmental goals. The message is clear: the BJP remains committed to its roots, while forging ahead with a clear vision for India’s future. The success of Modi 3.0 will depend not just on its policy prowess but on its ability to smoothen rough edges, if any, say political pundits. However, these political pundits forget that PM Modi is very much his own person, extremely comfortable in his own skin. Modi is passionately firm about his stand on key issues that matter, and is yet never averse to listening to diverse opinions or imbibing what works for the greater good, even if that entails making small sacrifices in the process. And that precisely is what makes Narendra Modi who he is—a towering tall persona whose style of politics is not only shaping the destiny of 1.4 billion Indians but also making a huge impact on global geopolitics. Modi has turned anti-incumbency into pro-incumbency and this is due to his untiring ability to constantly reinvent himself, while his opponents continue to grapple with being fringe players. The 139-year-old Congress party could not even touch 100 seats and the INDI alliance was contained at 234 seats in the 2024 general elections. In sharp contrast, the Modi juggernaut emerged unscathed, pretty much holding its own. If numbers mean what they do, then sample this– in the last three Lok Sabha elections put together, the tally of the Congress from Uttar Pradesh is a mere nine seats. On the contrary, that number from UP, for the BJP in the last three Lok Sabha elections combined, is a staggering 170 seats. Politics is not just about momentum but a proven track record too. In the case of Prime Minister Modi, he has both momentum and an excellent track record working to his advantage. Add to that his consistency in delivering on electoral promises, and what you have is a lethal combination in terms of a leader who knows his mind, knows what to do and more importantly, how to do it, so that an aspirational India becomes a reality.

    "article_content": "Written By : Dr Ravi Mittal News18.com Last Updated: June 17, 2024, 15:12 IST New Delhi, India The Suvidha portal is a ‘Single Window System’ developed by ECI to streamline the nomination process and requests for permissions from political parties and candidates during the election period. (Image: PTI file) In two months since the announcement of elections and the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) becoming operational, the Suvidha platform received over 3.06 lakh permission requests from political parties and candidates. 75 per cent of those requests have been approved, around 40,000 were rejected, and around 30,000 were invalid or duplicates. The rest of the applications are under process. The Suvidha portal is a ‘Single Window System’ developed by ECI to streamline the nomination process and requests for permissions from political parties and candidates during the election period. All applications seeking permissions are mandatorily disposed of within 24 hours. Through the Suvidha portal, candidates, party representatives, candidates’ representatives, and election agents can make submissions online from anywhere at any time. Permissions from different departments are essential under various provisions of the Representations of People’s Act, Model Code of Conduct guidelines, and state laws related to property defacement, use of loudspeakers, etc. Permissions are also critical for expenditure monitoring, maintenance of law and order, and controlling traffic, e.g., during rallies, public meetings, etc. The Suvidha platform caters to permissions for public meetings, organising rallies, opening temporary party offices, door-to-door canvassing, video vans, helicopters, obtaining vehicle permits, loudspeakers, and distributing pamphlets. Political parties or candidates can create profiles using their mobile numbers to submit and track permission requests. Requests can be made online in standard application forms or digitised by the concerned officers if submitted physically. The Permission Cells, with the necessary infrastructure and staff, are set up to facilitate this process, which forwards applications to various nodal officers of other departments to obtain specific clearances from respective departments within 24 hours. Candidates can monitor their application status and download approved permissions through the app or Suvidha portal. SMS updates are also sent at all steps. Applications for events or rallies must be submitted at least 48 hours before and, at most, within seven days. The Suvidha Application streamlines candidate nominations, which can be submitted online or offline. For online submissions, candidates register on the ECI Suvidha portal using a mobile number and OTP, which then auto-fetch relevant details via the EPIC number. They enter personal information in the nomination form and affidavit online, select three preferred dates for physical submission, make a security deposit online, enter challan details or choose cash. The form must be printed, signed, and physically submitted to the Returning Officer within specified hours by the candidate himself or by his proposer between 11 AM and 3 PM to the Returning Officer on the selected date and place. The Returning Officers process and verify the nominations and give appointments based on the preferences indicated by the candidates. They also verify online payments. Upon verification, officers generate and verify receipts, provide signed copies to candidates, and prepare a checklist per Commission instructions. The online nomination facility closes one day before the last nomination date. The citizen gets the candidate’s entered details and the affidavit submitted, including criminal antecedents, during the nomination on the Know Your Candidate (KYC), Saksham, and voter helpline apps. Before the introduction of the technological platform, the system was cumbersome and inefficient. The traditional method required a physical visit to the returning officer’s office, which was time-consuming and inaccessible for many. It also led to delays, a lack of transparency, and complaints about prioritisation for issuing the permissions. The Suvidha platform offers a uniform one-stop platform for all candidates, granting permissions on a first-come, first-served basis to ensure equal opportunity for all contesting candidates. A user-friendly interface and robust features simplify the process, ensuring all necessary permissions are acquired efficiently, conveniently and promptly. This means they can focus more on the campaign activities than get bogged down by procedural formalities. This accessibility is particularly beneficial in remote and rural areas where physical access to offices is challenging. It further ensures transparency by offering real-time tracking of applications, status updates, timestamped submissions, and communication via SMS. Additionally, by digitising various election-related processes, the Suvidha application has significantly reduced the administrative burden on election officials. Automating tasks such as nomination filing and permission granting has led to quicker and more efficient election management. Moreover, the permission data available on the portal serves as a valuable resource for scrutinising election expenditures, contributing to greater accountability and integrity in the electoral process. Overall, the Suvidha platform embodies the commitment to fostering transparency, efficiency, and fairness in the electoral process, significantly transforming the interface between candidates and the administration. As we move forward, the continued evolution of such digital initiatives will play a crucial role in shaping the future of elections in India.

    "article_content": "Written By : Bibek Debroy News18.com Last Updated: June 17, 2024, 15:51 IST New Delhi, India What’s done through a Budget, for items where there is choice, has that trade-off. In an indirect democracy, Budgets reflect the will of the people through legislatures. (Shutterstock) In 1932, Lionel Robbins wrote an essay, ‘ An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science’ (the 1935 version is more familiar). I suspect that essay is rarely read now, though it is still worth a read. But every entry-level student of economics knows the Robbins definition of Economics. “Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.” Elsewhere in the essay, “The economist studies the disposal of scarce means.” Precisely. Had means or resources been unlimited, there would have been nothing worth studying. The key to the discipline is the opportunity costs of resources and the trade-off. To use the example made famous by Paul Samuelson, does society spend on guns, or does it spend on butter? Samuelson’s first name reminds me of another famous quote from a George Bernard Shaw book, Everybody’s Political What’s What? , published in 1944. It’s a bit of a cliched quote. “A government which robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul,” Shaw said this in the context of inflation, when debtors (with debt fixed in nominal terms) benefit. Clearly, Shaw liked the name. In that book, he alludes to Tsar Paul (Russian Emperor from 1796 to 1801) several times. But Shaw did not coin the Peter-Paul example. It figures in Kipling’s 1919 poem, “The Gods of the Copybook Headings”. “In the Carboniferous Epoch, we were promised abundance for all, by robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul.” Both Peter and Paul were apostles and there is a natural alliteration in using the names together. According to folklore, the expression has to do with the church of St Peter at Westminster (now Westminster Abbey). In 1540 this became a Cathedral. But when the Diocese of Westminster was dissolved in 1550, it stopped being a Cathedral and its assets were used to rebuild Saint Paul’s Cathedral. This sounds like a plausible explanation. Surely, that business about opportunity costs is obvious. To tell us that, why do we need the discipline of economics? By the way, there is plenty of economics in something like The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy . Serious stuff, not only the flippant “Magrathea (an ancient planet) is a myth, a fairy story, it’s what parents tell their kids about at night if they want them to grow up to become economists.” In defence of my profession, we need economists (and the discipline), not because they provide conclusive answers to any problem, but because of the way they approach a problem. They list out the costs and benefits (both of which might be imperfectly understood if you depended only on common sense) of alternative choices. In the process, economists often have the long-term in mind, notwithstanding wisecracks about the long-run quote by Keynes, usually quoted by people who haven’t read A Tract on Monetary Reform , written by John Maynard Keynes in 1923. The cliched quote is from this tract and unless one reads the complete tract, one doesn’t necessarily get the context. To return to the point, Peter may be the future generation and Paul the present generation. Decisions may lead to robbing the future to pay for the present. This trade-off is always relevant. It becomes especially relevant at this time of the year. The Union Budget for 2024-25 is in the offing and typically, State Budgets follow suit. Some elements of revenue and expenditure are frozen (exogenously determined) in the short term for both sets of Budgets, but not all. What’s done through a Budget, for items where there is choice, has that trade-off. In an indirect democracy, Budgets reflect the will of the people through legislatures. In Kohima cemetery, there is a famous epitaph, composed by John Maxwell Edmonds. “When you go home/Tell them of us and say/For your tomorrow/We gave our today.” It’s a beautiful epitaph. But such sacrificing of a person’s today for someone else’s tomorrow only occurs in exceptional circumstances, wars, freedom movements and so on. Rarely is altruism a human trait, even rarer when money matters are concerned. Individually, we understand the trade-off between today and tomorrow. That’s the reason we don’t consume today and save up for a rainy day, or for when we will get old, or for my progeny. Then, along comes an economist with an argument that the capital expenditure multiplier is greater than the revenue expenditure multiplier and that the revenue expenditure multiplier is greater than a tax reduction multiplier. That won’t necessarily resonate. Better roads, railways and airports may help enhance the productive potential of the economy. I do appreciate the need for that, but let someone else pay for it. I want a reduction in taxes right now. This is a bit like the fable about a king who wanted to fill a pond with milk. He asked every citizen to contribute a glass of milk. They did. However, each thought others would bring the milk and he/she brought a glass of water instead. The pond was filled with water, no milk. Economists will couch this in fancy game theoretic terms. But this is the essence of freebies and populism, also encountered during the recent elections. We do get the economy we deserve.

    "article_content": "Written By : Reshmi Dasgupta News18.com Last Updated: June 18, 2024, 14:04 IST New Delhi, India The US Supreme Court, with its conservative majority, is seen as the only “unmanageable” section of the judiciary by liberal activists and hence there have repeated attacks on certain key judges. (Reuters File) There is a good reason why US President Joe Biden has been singing hosannas to the American judicial system after his son Hunter was found guilty of three felony counts related to buying guns while an addict and then lying about it. He needs to balance out the concerted attack on the US Supreme Court by those affiliated to his side of the political spectrum—or divide—ahead of a key case involving the current frontrunner for the White House in November, Donald Trump. The fact that a ‘liberal’ activist inveigled herself into a private event and recorded conversations with a conservative justice of the US Supreme Court in order to make remarks that would force their recusal from cases involving Trump indicates an insidious plan to delegitimise key institutions. This happening as US heads into a very contentious election would sound familiar to Indians who had been swamped with anti-Election Commission and anti-EVM news. In India too, partisan politics in the guise of liberal ‘concerns’ was taken to the highest court with select media drumming up a narrative that the justices might have been amenable to government pressure, in case their verdicts did not suit the petitioners. The results of the elections vindicated the judges’ impartial dismissal of accusations against two key parts of India’s electoral system, but the assaulters have not made any public apologies for their motivated allegations. In the US, a curiously similar move is afoot, with the courts in some states being openly used to corral the Republican presidential candidate and prevent him from being on the 2024 ballot. The US Supreme Court, with its conservative majority, is seen as the only “unmanageable” section of the judiciary by liberal activists and hence there have repeated attacks on certain key judges, particularly the combative Samuel A Alito Jr, elevated to the SC Bench by George W Bush. So it was not surprising that private remarks of Justice Alito were recorded and released by Lauren Windsor. But they did not exactly reveal, as intended, a bigoted conservative demon. A lot depended on how the outspoken judge’s mostly anodyne observations were interpreted by liberal megaphones in the US. The Wall Street Journal called the sting and its presentation as a “partisan pile-on” and wryly added that Justice Alito stood falsely accused of candour. Asked a leading question by Windsor (who posed as a religious conservative to attend a private event where Alito was present) whether the court should intervene in a case, all Justice Alito said was, “We have a very defined role. We need to do what we’re supposed to do, but this is a bigger problem. This is way above us. So I wish I knew the answer. I do.” That is hardly evidence of a judge behaving in a biased manner on a key matter, rendering him unfit to judge Trump. But Windsor’s explanation to Rolling Stone magazine was predictable. She said, “One of the main drivers for me in this work is showing Americans that we are at a crossroads: Do we embrace the idea of secular democracy and uphold that tradition, or do we start to transition into a Christian theocracy?” Swap the words ‘American’ and ‘Christian’ with ‘Indian’ and ‘Hindu’ and it sounds much like the Doomsday scenarios commonly articulated in ‘liberal’ Indian media. Alito is a favourite target, along with his fellow conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, particularly as two key cases relating to Trump are about to reach the Supreme Court, including the “riot” on Capitol Hill on January 6, 2021. In fact, the clamour over an upside down US flag flying atop Alito’s home that same month is intended to convey that he is biased, because many Trump supporters did the same, to show their anger over his victory being “stolen” by Biden. Conflicting accounts of the upside down flag incidents suggest a determined bid to tar Alito with the bigot brush. Consider if the following happens to an Indian Supreme Court Justice or spouse: On the street where the judge lives, a neighbour deliberately puts up offensive signs, calculated to upset supporters of a certain controversial top political leader. Several months later, the same neighbour puts up a few more equally rude signboards, this time using two ‘F’ words. Then that neighbour takes a drive up the street—a cul de sac, so it was not an inadvertent passing of the judge’s residence—to see the reaction of that judge and family. They are seen by the judge’s spouse, who decides they are harassing her by their signboards and drive-bys. She raises an upside down flag on her home, a traditional method used by sailors to indicate distress. Her husband is then branded a bigot, but the neighbour’s actions are not seen as intimidatory! There is also an incident a few weeks later wherein the judge’s wife has a verbal altercation with that neighbour in which expletives were used by both sides. The neighbour calls that exchange ‘harassment’ but not her own actions! A year or so later, when the same judge is part of a landmark Supreme Court verdict, protestors demonstrate with placards outside his residence, after his supposed judgement is leaked. Would this behaviour be tolerated at all by Indian SC judges? The focused nature of their attack is significant. Biden has praised the federal judge and judicial system, but the foot soldiers of the movement to get him re-elected have been targeting every aspect of Alito’s life on and off the bench. Apart from his supposed conservative ‘bias’ he has often been described by media and liberal politicians as having taken favours from big business—all because he once took the last seat on a billionaire’s private plane to an event in Alaska! There are pretty categorical rules for judges, including the circumstances under which they should recuse themselves from cases. The US Supreme Court has an overwhelming majority of conservative judges and, unlike in India, they will stay on the Bench for life or until they willingly retire. Pressuring judges seen to be ‘unfriendly’ to the dispensations in the White House and Capitol Hill is not unknown. But the current level of pressure on Alito is unprecedented. There has been an escalation of pressure on judges in India too before important cases are adjudicated. But so far neither activists nor the media have taken to looking at the off-Bench lives of judges in order to build pressure, as they are now doing in the US. Perhaps because judges here are quite sensitive to unfair intrusions into their personal spaces and there are enough instances of contempt of court rulings on such infractions to prevent US style attacks on judges. These attacks on the conservative justices of the US Supreme Court are certain to continue, even after the cases are begun to be heard. Meanwhile Biden is also likely to continue to mouth platitudes about the judicial system so that it does not seem like a coordinated move to help his currently parlous re-election chances. Apex court judges in all countries should take note of what is happening in the US, as this sort of virus tends to spread very rapidly through the Internet. The author is a freelance writer.

    "article_content": "Written By : Digvijay Singh News18.com Last Updated: June 18, 2024, 15:47 IST New Delhi, India The implementation of the NEP involves simultaneous monitoring and adaptation, significantly decentralising education in India (Representative Image) The implementation of the NEP will proceed with a phased and systematic approach. It represents not just a policy but a commitment to future generations. — Narendra Modi The National Education Policy 2020 (NEP) is a comprehensive initiative aimed at revitalising and modernising the education sector in India. Deeply integrated into Indian society, this policy serves as a catalyst for transforming the Indian education system. In the 21st century, where knowledge, information, and skills are crucial, the NEP encompasses all these elements. It embodies holistic development, Indic perspectives, and alignment with market needs, making it a model for contemporary global education policies. India stands at a crucial juncture in global politics, and the NEP is poised to enhance its soft power significantly. A significant achievement of the NEP is the shift from ‘What to Think’ to ‘How to Think’, focusing on nurturing national character through individual student development. It aims to propel India towards a $5 trillion economy by prioritising education that emphasises upskilling, integrated learning, and equity, aiming for a more inclusive and holistic education system. The implementation of the NEP involves simultaneous monitoring and adaptation, significantly decentralising education in India and fostering targeted approaches across various educational sectors. This process engages diverse stakeholders such as government bodies, educational institutions, teachers, and the community. Continuous assessment at institutional levels addresses local needs, considering diverse socio-economic backgrounds and cultures. For instance, in rural areas, initiatives focus on enhancing digital literacy and vocational training to align education with local employment opportunities. Nationally, implementing agencies prioritize effective policy rollout, resource allocation, literacy rates, school enrollment, curriculum implementation, teacher training, and technology integration. The NEP has opened new avenues for students through its emphasis on multidimensional, multidisciplinary, and holistic education. Institutions like the University of Delhi have adopted a comprehensive approach with seven verticals including core subjects, elective courses, skill enhancement, internships, and value-added courses. This framework allows students to tailor their education to their interests, career aspirations, and current market demands. Moreover, the policy promotes research, innovation, and entrepreneurship through new incubation centres that provide mentorship and resources for students pursuing entrepreneurial ventures or innovative solutions. Universities nationwide are fostering extensive research collaborations at both national and international levels, offering unprecedented opportunities for students and faculty and facilitating industry-academia partnerships. Career Development Centres (CDCs) are being established across colleges and universities to offer comprehensive support, including personalised mentorship, ensuring students are well-prepared for the job market. At the University of Delhi, these centres are integrated with tailored mentorship programmes to meet individual career needs and aspirations, enhancing students’ professional readiness. The implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) has brought about a notable transformation in the understanding and practice of equity and inclusion across India, particularly at the grassroots level. Various governmental and educational agencies have been actively working to ensure that all students, including those from Socio-Economically Disadvantaged Groups (SEDGs), have equitable access to high-quality education. This concerted effort aims to achieve the NEP’s goals of fostering equity and inclusion in higher education. For instance, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Open University’s Centre for Equal Opportunities and Inclusive Education has launched Atri, a specialised learning center dedicated to supporting disadvantaged groups such as transgenders and sex workers. Additionally, the university has established the Gargi Centre for Holistic Development of Women, which not only provides research grants but also offers customised courses developed in collaboration with industry partners. Furthermore, the Central University of Tripura has introduced postgraduate level courses that teach the language of scheduled tribes to preserve and promote their cultural and linguistic heritage while providing higher educational opportunities. These efforts underscore a national commitment to broadening access to education and fostering inclusivity, ensuring that all segments of society can benefit from and contribute to India’s educational landscape. Flexibility is a fundamental principle of the NEP, as the curriculum framework is designed to transform the educational landscape of the nation. Early childhood care and education have invigorated elementary and school education. Notably, under PM SHRI (PM Schools for Rising India) for school upgrades, 6,448 schools were selected, and Rs 630.11 crore was allocated to 6,207 PM SHRI schools across 27 States/UTs, including KVS/NVS. The Samagra Shiksha Scheme has been fully aligned with NEP 2020’s recommendations, with a total financial outlay of Rs 2,94,283.04 crore, of which Rs 1,85,398.32 crore is the Central share. The PM Poshan Shakti Nirman Yojna is also aligned with NEP 2020’s recommendations. In higher education institutions, a systemic transformation is underway with the National Credit Framework, offering broad-based, multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary, holistic education with flexible curricula, creative subject combinations, multiple pathways, and equivalence establishment, facilitating both national and international mobility. Additionally, 7,568 Institutions’ Innovation Councils and approximately 104 Idea Development, Evaluation, and Application Labs (IDEA) have been established to foster research and innovation. The National Education Policy (NEP) has triggered a nationwide digital revolution and significantly reduced the digital divide. A robust digital infrastructure stands out as one of the most comprehensive achievements of the NEP’s implementation drive. The National Educational Technology Forum (NETF) has played a crucial role in integrating technology with education. Anuvadini, an AI Text & Voice Translation Tool, has been launched to empower over 80 per cent of the population who identify as non-English native language speakers. Supported by AICTE, Anuvadini transcends language barriers by offering translation services in 22 regional Indian and foreign languages, thereby strengthening the principles of Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat. The University of Delhi has achieved a significant rise in the QS World University Rankings, climbing from 407th place last year to 328th in 2024, accompanied by notable advancements in employment outcomes. While several Indian educational institutions are steadily approaching the goals set by the National Education Policy, much remains to be accomplished across all fronts. Educators and students in remote regions face daunting challenges due to inadequate training and resources. Despite improvements in enrollment figures, meticulous planning and vigilant oversight are imperative at every stage. Addressing ingrained societal disparities is essential to enhance educational accessibility and equity. A dedicated budget tailored for rural areas is urgently required to effectively implement the NEP and bridge the digital divide in education. The National Education Policy not only charts a course for educational reform but also promises a brighter future for generations to come through strategic implementation and unwavering commitment.

    "article_content": "Written By : Arun Anand News18.com Last Updated: June 18, 2024, 17:56 IST New Delhi, India RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat talked about the changing nature of Indian politics in context of recently held Lok Sabha polls. (PTI File) There has been widespread speculation in media and social media over the last few days whether differences have arisen between the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its ideological mentee, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), after the Lok Sabha elections. It is also speculated that the RSS is perhaps not happy with the working style of the BJP leadership and the Narendra Modi government. There were two major developments that sparked these speculations. First, a critical article about the BJP was published in an English weekly immediately after the Lok Sabha poll results were out where the BJP’s performance remained short of expectations. This English weekly is often described as the mouthpiece of the Sangh. Second, a speech was given by Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat in Nagpur on June 10 in which he made certain remarks about the nature of electoral politics. These remarks were interpreted as a reprimand to the BJP. It seems that due to lack of understanding about the working style of the RSS and with an intent to create confusion, a deliberate and well-planned narrative is being built up projecting that there is a power struggle between the RSS and the BJP. Let us look at some of the facts. First, let us talk about the article published in the weekly. Two facts are important in this context. First, this weekly is not the mouthpiece of the Sangh. The Sangh has officially said many times that it does not have a mouthpiece. There are many publications who promote the ideology of the Sangh but none of them is a mouthpiece. Hence, the reports or editorials in these publications do not represent the official view of the Sangh. Second, the official opinion of the Sangh is expressed only by the Sarsanghchalak and Sarkaryavah (General Secretary). Apart from this, sometimes the Sangh formally authorises some of its officials to talk to the media or to express their opinion publicly. The writer, editor or the publisher of this article in question do not fall in either these three categories. Therefore, it is not factually correct to consider this article as the viewpoint of the Sangh. As far as the speech of the Sarsanghchalak is concerned, some analysts have termed his comments as a taunt on the BJP leadership, “The one who really serves do that with restrain and dignity. Everyone works but while working one needs to follow that restraint. And the one who while working also remains detached, dignified and restrained, doesn’t become arrogant. He is the one who deserves to be called ‘Sevak’.” Those who were trying to create controversy from this statement, ignored the fact that Bhagwat also said a few more things along with this comment, which gives the right context. He said, “It came to my mind that there is no other way but this is best and simplest way to tell how the Sangh works.” Bhagwat clearly said citing examples that he was explaining the attitude of the Sangh through his remarks. Bhagwat further added, “If we keep getting entangled in these things, the work will remain incomplete.” He was making these remarks at the valedictory ceremony of an RSS training camp in Nagpur that was attended by swayamsevaks (RSS volunteers) and dignitaries from various walks of life. It is clear that what he meant was to caution the volunteers of the Sangh about remaining focused on their work while also explaining to dignitaries how the RSS functions. His remarks when looked at in this context do not seem to be aimed at either the BJP or at any individual leader. These remarks were taken out of context and misinterpreted in an attempt to create ‘friction’ where none exists. In the same speech, Bhagwat talked about the changing nature of Indian politics in context of recently held LokSabha polls. Is it not true that common citizens of the country are feeling that the level of debate amongst the political parties has hit rock bottom? This concern was reflected in Bhagwat’s speech. It is a well-known fact that ‘deep fake’ videos of BJP and Sangh officials were made and posted on social media during elections. During the election campaign, a web of lies was woven for political gain that the BJP would change the Constitution and end reservation. After the election, we saw women queuing up at Congress offices across the country to get Rs 8,500 per month to every poor family that was promised by Congress during the poll campaign. This revealed the extent of false promises and blatant lies used by the Opposition in Lok Sabha polls to get a few more votes and to stop the BJP from coming to power. It is a matter of serious concern and has long-term repercussions for Indian democracy. Some of these issues were flagged in Bhagwat’s same speech. The Sarsanghchalak said that during the election campaign, there was an attempt to spread false propaganda in the name of the Sangh. This was done by misusing technology, which is a matter of concern. In this context, he rightly cautioned that we need to do some course correction in our polity. Bhagwat, referring to rivalry among political parties, said, “This is competition, not a war among ourselves. The way these things were said, the way each other was reprimanded, if we do this during the campaign, it will increase discord in the society, society will be divided into two groups, doubts and suspicions will arise among us. This was also not taken into account. Organisations like the Sangh were also dragged into it without any reason. False propaganda was spread with the help of technology. Absolutely false. Is this how we should use science (and) knowledge? Good people do not misuse knowledge like this.” In fact, the Sarsanghchalak’s speech indicated that we need a holistic reform in our political culture and all political parties should work together for this. He said, “A lot of good has happened in the last ten years… but this does not mean that we are free from challenges.” The clear message of the Sarsanghchalak was that the mission to take India forward on the path of development should not become a victim of political rivalry and it is time to build on the foundation laid down by the Modi government during the last 10 years.

    "article_content": "Written By : Akhileshwar Sahay News18.com Last Updated: June 18, 2024, 18:59 IST New Delhi, India A good trains rammed into the Kanchanjunga Express in West Bengal on Monday. On June 17 morning, a railway accident killed scores of people near the Rangapani station (about 30 km from north Bengal’s New Jalpaiguri station) in the Katihar division of Northeastern Frontier Railway (NFR). Four compartments of the Sealdah-bound Kanchanjungha Express derailed (two went turtle) after being hit by a goods train from the rear. There’s still no confirmed number of the dead, with the casualty varying from 6 to 15; the number of the injured varies between 30 and 60. The casualty could have been much higher but for the fact that the locomotive of the freight train rammed from behind the stationary express train, with the guard’s brake-van and two parcel vans facing the direct brunt of the accident. Had it been a collision between two express trains, the number of casualties would have been much higher — similar to what was witnessed during the Coromandel Express accident last year, in which at least 296 people died and more than 1,200 injured. Decoding the reasons behind an accident is the domain of the Commissioner Railway Safety (CRS). But the Railway Board jumped the gun, saying: “The goods train driver violated the signal.” Contrarily, other reports quoting railway sources suggest there was automatic signal failure that morning and the goods train driver was issued a written authority by the Ranipatra station master, authorising him to pass all automatic signals between RNI (Ranipatra Station) and CAT (Chattar Hat Junction). If the truth is contrary to what the railway board opined initially, it is time for unconditional public apology. Like the Balasore accident, where the railway minister supervised the relief and rescue operation day and night, he landed at the site of the latest accident too. It raises a fundamental question: With NDRF, SDRF, state police, district administration, local citizens, and railway personnel at the accident site, why should the railway minister be present there? And whether his presence galvanises or impedes the rescue and restoration operations. Behind every such avoidable mayhem, there are at least dozens, if not hundreds, of cases of near miss of this type, and it is the composite failure of the railway authorities to not take these near-misses seriously despite other wise laudable achievement of Indian Railways running nearly 24000 passenger trains daily and carrying 1.59 billion tonnes of goods annually. True to their skin, politicians of all hues have spoken. While all are sympathetic to the dead and the injured, the Opposition is unanimous in training its guns on the government, especially railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. The Congress has blamed the minister for “mismanagement”, and being “busy with making reels”, thus having no time to discuss safety of the people. Former railway minister and current Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, in whose state the latest accident has taken place, has the following to say: “This government is only interested in elections. How to go for hacking… how to go for manipulation… They do not take care of amenities… bathrooms are dirty and there are dirty things in bedding… They do not take care of the railway staff.” The railway minister responded, saying that “this is not the time for politics and the “rescue operation has” to be “completed” first. Ironically, during Mamata Banerjee’s stint as railway minister, an accident involving the Howrah-Lokmanya Tilak Terminus Jnaneswari Super Deluxe Express saw at least 140 people killed and more than 200 injured. I do not have the complete record of railway accidents since 1853 when the first train ran between Boribunder and Thane in the country. But Wikipedia has records of railway accidents since 1901, and the twentieth century began with a major accident when on September 12, 1902, a derailment of the Bombay-Madras Mail on a bridge near Mangapatnam, Kadapa district killed 100 passengers. A careful perusal of all the railway accidents since formation of the interim government by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1946 brings out the humbling truth of every railway minister encountering major accidents during his respective tenures. Governments have come and gone but the accidents have stayed put obdurately. With the political memory fragile, it would be important to remember that the worst accident in the history of Indian railways took place at Badlaghat in Bihar in 1981 during Congress regime in which an estimated 300-800 people perished when the entire train plunged in the Bagmati river. Till date the cause of the accident is shrouded in mystery. The Kanchanjungha Express accident is the first major accident of the year. Notwithstanding the fact that the year 2023 saw a major spike in the railway accident, nonetheless, the last 10 years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi or for that matter the tenure of railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has been a shade better than their predecessors. Near misses, incidents and accidents in Indian Railways follow the typical parable of an elephant and six blind men of India. The entire story of identification of near-misses, incidents, and accidents in IR, is full of deceit and dishonesty where every department, every division and every zone are busy in massive operation cover up and not letting the truth out. Branch officers keep Division Railway Manager in the dark, who in turn does the same with the General Manager and the distant railway board mandarins sitting on the second floor of the “Rail Bhawan” are perennially in the dark and blissful in their ignorance. It is saddening to note that in the present era of instant connectivity, IR is unable to record-near-misses, incidents, and accidents real time. There are causes galore of why accidents continue to happen in India and why IR does not learn the lesson. Here are few of them: One, railway safety is baby of none: And the principal reason is that even after the passage of twelve years since the submission of the report of the “High Powered Committee on the Railways Safety” headed by noted scientist Dr. Anil Kakodkar, IR is yet to implement its recommendation of setting up an independent safety architecture in form of the Rail Safety Authority (RSA). The Railway Ministry continues to play the role of police, pleader, and judge, with the rule-making, operations and the regulation all vested in the Railway Board. There is no oversight body to safeguard railway safety. Two, whither Raksha Kavach: The trend of IR accidents in the last three decades is unmistakable: The bulk of accidents are caused by human error. Also, with substantial reduction in manned and unmanned level crossings, collisions have become bigger killers. A NITI Aayog report found that human failure, including the fault of railway staff, caused 87 per cent of the 586 consequential accidents recorded between 2012-13 and 2016-17. Worse, year-on-year, the share of fault of railway staff in accidents grew incrementally. Raksha Kavach, originally invented and patented by Konkan Railway, is one definitive way to stop collisions. Had there been Kavach, the Kanchanjungha Express accident would have possibly been stopped. But thus far Kavach has been installed only on 1,500 km of the track and railways plans to extend it to 3,000 km in near future. Three, IRMS is a flawed reform: It will come as a surprise to readers that the biggest chunk of IR officers are doctors. Historically, Indian Railways used to attract the country’s best talent from the Indian Civil Services Exam and Indian Engineering Services Exams as Class I officers. The Indian Railways Management Service (IRMS) has been a blotched reform. It is proving to be a nostrum that will kill the patient without curing the illness. I get nightmares thinking who will manage old, decrepit IR bridges in future and what will happen if one of the distressed IR bridges has its Morbi bridge moment. Even the committee headed by Bibek Debroy had recommended combining eight railways’ services into two — one general service and another technical service. Four, poor human resource, poorer training: While the recruitment of Class-I officers in IR has been marred in controversy after introduction of IRMS, less said the better about the recruitment and quality of Class-III and Class-IV staff. Here is one example: On January 30, 2024, Principal Special Judge for Central Bureau of Investigation, Hyderabad, Madhusudhan Rao in a case that saw justice after 14 years, sentenced the then Chairman of Railway Recruitment Board, Mumbai, Satendra Mohan Sharma, the then Chief Executive Officer of Hassan-Mangalore Rail Development Corporation A.K. Jagannadham and eight others to five years’ rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs 7,87,000 in a case pertaining to paper leak of an exam conducted by RRB for posts of ‘assistant station master’ and ‘assistant loco pilot’ in 2010. This is just the tip of the iceberg and the real malaise lies much deeper. Also, there are many back-channels for children of railway men to get jobs in IR: one is known as medical decategorisation. The appointment of Class-IV staff is among the most non-transparent recruitments in the country. What is more surprising is the growing apathy of IR towards training and also lack of training opportunities. The National Academy of Indian Railways (NAIR), Vadodara, one of the finest training institutions to train Class-I officers in the country, has been dismantled. Zonal Railways still have something known as Zonal Training School (ZTC), but their curriculum, faculty, teaching methods and teaching standards have become pathetic. And, in the last four decades, at least this author has not seen a proper training centre in a railway division office (an average railway division has 18,000-30,000 employees). For IR, it is the time to introspect, retrospect and make a firm resolve to let go of the “chalta hai” attitude, and imbibe the “Mission Zero Rai Fatality” statutorily. This statement of the author reminds him of Bill 1996/97:137 introduced and passed in Swedish Parliament to chart out the mission zero death goal for road fatalities in that country and it indeed achieved that goal. What Sweden can do vis-à-vis road fatalities; it is time for IR to do the same for rail fatalities. It is imminently doable. If there is any doubt, IR needs to look at the Japanese Railway East (JR East) whose Shinkansen trains are incident free for decades, and which has a Rail Accident Museum to train its personnel.

    "article_content": "Written By : Arup Ghosh News18.com Last Updated: June 18, 2024, 19:37 IST New Delhi, India Locals gather after the Kanchanjungha Express collided with a goods train, near New Jalpaiguri railway station, on Monday, June 17, 2024. (PTI photo) In the context of the recent tragic railway accident in New Jalpaiguri, West Bengal, which resulted in the loss of at least 15 lives, there has been a growing call from Opposition parties for Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw to step down, citing moral responsibility. Given the vast and complex nature of the Indian Railways, one of the largest networks in the world, it raises an important question: Should the responsibility for such accidents rest solely on the shoulders of a single minister? Considering the scale and intricacies involved in managing this enormous transportation system, it can be argued that the solution isn’t the sacking of the individual who holds the top position. Instead, a thorough examination and systemic approach could offer more substantial answers to improving railway safety and accountability. Having said that, does moral responsibility count for much in 2024? Through the decades, India has had a long history of grim and gruesome rail disasters. But so far only two ministers — Lal Bahadur Shastri and Nitish Kumar — have resigned. Shastri resigned twice after accidents in 1956. When he quit in August 1956 after 112 people died, the then Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, refused to accept it. Three months later, 144 people died in another accident. Shastri wanted to go “quietly”. Nehru reluctantly agreed. Nitish Kumar resigned in 1999 after 290 people died in the Gaisal (West Bengal) accident. But, he was back as Railway Minister two years later. Mamata Banerjee offered to quit in 2000 after a train accident in Punjab killed 43 people. The then Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, refused to let her go. She was back as Railway Minister in the UPA government later. Suresh Prabhu, after a series of accidents, offered to quit but it was rejected. One of the accidents killed 150 people near Kanpur. He was shifted to Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Owning moral responsibility is one thing but making the rail sector safe for travel is another. Ashwini Vaishnaw is a highly experienced bureaucrat-cum-technocrat. He was a good pick to head Railways as India tries to revamp and modernise this vital Sector. Vaishnaw is from IIT Kanpur, a former IAS officer, entrepreneur, and has had the experience of working with some of India’s top politicians. For several decades now, the Indian Railways have grappled with insurmountable challenges such as ageing infrastructure, perennial overcrowding, size and complexity and lack of sufficient modernisation and safety measures. Regarding the latest accident in West Bengal, Railway Board CEO Jaya Varma Sinha said that the Kavach system, which protects trains from accidents, was not in place on the particular route. Reports say the passenger train was stationary on the tracks when the goods train rammed into it. The rear compartments of the Kanchanjunga Express were mostly carrying cargo hence the death toll has been mercifully low. What is the Kavach system? The Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO) created the armour-like Kavach anti-collision technology with the intention of achieving “zero accidents”. It is the least expensive automatic train collision prevention technology, according to the railways. The technology possesses the highest certification level: Safety Integrity Level 4 (SIL-4) certification. It indicates that there is a 10,000-year chance of only one Kavach mistake. In 2022-23, the government intended to bring 2,000 kilometres of the train network under Kavach. The goal was for the system to encompass over 34,000 km of train infrastructure. But since the initial field testing on the passenger trains began in February 2016, the Railways have so far implemented the Kavach system on 1,465 route kilometres and 139 locomotives (including Electric Multiple Unit rakes) on the South Central Railway, having tendered 6,000 km of the system. Upgrades include 100 per cent electrification of railways, upgrading existing lines with more facilities and higher speeds, expansion of new lines, upgrading railway stations, introducing and eventually developing a large high-speed train network. The modernisation plan of railways includes an investment of Rs 10-12 lakh crore over the next five years for transforming Railways with modern world-class facilities. But there are endemic problems too. India’s railway tracks are burdened by too many passenger trains often leading to route congestion. Since freight and passenger trains use the same network (barring a few dedicated freight corridors) more than 40 per cent of Indian Railways’ sections are used beyond 100 per cent capacity. There is a lack of security consciousness in the railway administration, and efforts to control access to stations have not been adequate. For example, many stations have multiple entry and exit points, making it difficult to restrict entry. Official reports said that there could be poor coordination between railway security forces, police, and intelligence agencies. Incorporation of technologies like machine learning, biometric authentication and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) can improve surveillance and enhance security. The latest accident highlights the need for: The time is ripe for the Railways to improve their safety and security mechanism. Arup Ghosh is CEO of nnis, media entrepreneur and columnist.

    "article_content": "Written By : Raja Baradwaj News18.com Last Updated: June 19, 2024, 11:35 IST New Delhi, India M.C. Rajah was a towering leader who aimed to elevate his community to great heights. (vsktelangana.org) The title of this article is a reference to a study by a ‘foreign’ scholar about the Dalit movement in India. The author introduces M.C. Rajah as a Hindu Mahasabha Dalit, a sort of ‘mild’ slur akin to the modern-day moniker ‘Sanghi.’ Rao Bahadur Mylai Chinna Thambi Pillai Rajah, better known as M.C. Rajah, was one of the foremost Dalit voices of Bharat. He was born on June 17, 1883, in Chennai. He attended Wesley Mission High School in Royapettah, Chennai, and graduated from the Madras Christian College. He finished his teacher training course at the Saidapet Teacher Training College in Chennai and worked as a school teacher, and later a college professor. M.C. Rajah was a great orator, debater and a sportsman par excellence. He captained the Madras Christian College cricket team and was also a very gifted tennis player. He was the first Dalit leader in the Provincial Legislative Council (1919) and the Central Legislative Assembly (1925). He was a prolific scholar, a teacher of teachers, and, of course, the foremost advocate for equal rights for Dalits. Presenting the title of Rao Bahadur to M.C. Rajah, the Collector of Madras on December 15, 1922, remarked, “You are such a well-known public man that it is almost unnecessary for me to say much about you. No doubt you have received this title because of the work you have done for and the esteem in which you are rightly held by the members of your own important community of the Adi Dravidas. During the labour troubles, you did yeoman service in restraining from violence and in protecting them effectively from lawbreakers. You have represented your community in deputations to the Right Honourable Secretary of State and to His Excellency the Viceroy. You are the first Adi Dravida to enter the Legislative Council and you have the interests of the depressed and poor always at heart.” The readers will be pleasantly surprised to learn that M.C. Rajah, along with R. Ranganayaki Ammal, authored a book called Kindergarten Room . This book is a compendium of nursery rhymes, games and riddles which includes the most famous Tamil nursery rhymes such as Kai Veesamma Kai Veesu, Nila Nila Odivaa, Saindhaadamma Saindhaadu, and Kaakka Kannukku Mai Kondu Vaa. M.C. Rajah was your quintessential guru — not just a teacher but someone who brought clarity to your mind. His magnetic methods could pull even the students from the last bench forward. He was as good an administrator as he was a teacher. In 1917, he was appointed by the then Governor of Madras Province, Lord Pentland, to the committee that looked into elementary education in the province. Subsequently, he was drafted into the general body, which drafted the Elementary Education Policy. He was appointed to the Senate of Madras University in 1924 by Lord Willingdon. Along with T.S. Ramaswamy Iyer, he started the first government-approved free hostel for students from depressed classes. He was also a champion of the Scout movement. As the Director of the Scout movement in the Madras province, he was instrumental in spreading the Scout and Guide movement across the province. This was the time when Bharat faced two issues regarding Dalits and the depressed class: (1) the colonial masters were working from within and outside to remove the depressed classes from the Hindu fold, make them a separate block, and therefore control the nationalist upsurge, and (2) society needed to be reformed and cleansed of practices like untouchability, and the oppressed classes had to be mainstreamed. M.C. Rajah was someone who not only understood the gravitas of the need to address both these points but also how these two points were intertwined. The British played this politics of numbers at various levels. At the time of the first decennial Census in 1871-72, they were ‘obsessed’ with the question of whether the untouchables could be classified as Hindus. Though this question dragged on, there clearly was a guideline to mark them separately. They were instructed “to enumerate the castes and tribes returned or classed as Hindus who do not conform to certain (religious) standards or are subject to certain disabilities.” In 1906, the Muslims, as instructed by the private secretary of Lord Minto, drafted a proposal and took it across to him. According to this proposal, “The Mahommedans of India number, according to the census taken in the year 1901 …between one-fifth and one-fourth of the total population of His Majesty’s Indian Dominions, and if a reduction be made for the uncivilised portions of the community enumerated under the heads of animist and other minor religions, as well as for those classes who are ordinarily classified as Hindus but properly speaking are not Hindus at all, the proportion of Mahommedans to the Hindu majority becomes much larger.” The Governor of the Bombay Presidency, Sir Frederick Sykes, wrote a letter to the Viceroy, Lord Willingdon, on June 7, 1932. He said, “I consider that for political purposes the depressed classes should be considered as a community distinct from the Hindus and their representation should be treated as a subtraction from the Hindu vote.” Despite the best efforts of reformers, including M.C. Rajah, Sayajirao Gaikwad of Baroda, G.A. Natesan, T.V. Seshagiri Aiyer, Lala Lajpat Rai, and later Mahatma Gandhi upon his return from South Africa in 1915, the effort to manipulate numbers and exclude Dalits from the Hindu fold continues even today. Rajah saw through the ill effects of the ‘Communal Award’ proposal of giving separate electorates to society. He observed how the draft proposal was one-sided, offering more to the Muslims and very little to the depressed classes vis-à-vis the population. In February 1932, M.C. Rajah, who was then the President of the All India Depressed Classes Association, and Dr. B.S. Moonje of the Hindu Mahasabha signed an agreement known as the Rajah-Moonje Pact (R-MP) on joint electorates with reserved seats based on the population for the depressed classes. M.C. Rajah, in a letter to the then British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, mentioned this agreement of historical significance as an accord between “the only central organisation of the depressed classes” and “the organised body of Hindus, taken as a whole.” The Rajah-Moonje pact found significant support among the government, the press and the people concerned. Rajah was clear that conversion or communal migration would not improve the condition of the depressed classes. It might only slow down and stunt the slew of social and economic corrections the Hindu community made. In a public meeting of the All India Adi Dravida Mahajana Sabha in Nungambakkam, Chennai he said, “The president ( of this meeting ) mentioned that no other community other than us has more right to be called Hindus. Conversion will not bring about any good. By saying so, I am not undermining or wishing away the oppression and ills we have faced. We need to fight for our rights. The speed at which reforms are happening might be slow. But think about our current situation and how much it has improved. I beseech you to please abandon any move that will weaken us. I request the government to bring about the Untouchability Abolition Bill and pass it quickly. The Harijans are proud Hindus. That is the only reason why even after years of oppression by higher castes and a barrage of proselytisation efforts by other religions hasn’t changed their resolve being Hindus.” “It is my personal opinion that this issue ( of conversion ) has been mischievously amplified by people who have zero understanding of the Hindu religion and people who don’t follow it. Most of the problems our society faces are caste-based. This will cure itself once the respective castes become financially independent. Take, for example, the Thiyyas of Kerala or the Nadars of South India. Their social standing has improved manifold. And the only reason for that is that they concentrated on making their community financially independent and stable.” “ As long as I am concerned, I have full faith in the Hindu religion and I am ready to die as a Hindu. ” In a statement at the assembly on November 12, 1935, M.C Rajah stated, “While I fully share my resentment which many of our men feel at the treatment meted out to our people in many parts of the country by the so-called high caste Hindus, I would at the same time request them to compare conditions existing now with what they were, say 15 years ago. Conditions have improved considerably today. A large section of educated Hindu India has come to condemn the practice of untouchability and has thrown its weight on the side of the reform.” “I venture to say that in view of the awakening of the Hindu conscience that has been noticed in regard to our conditions and status, the days of untouchability as practiced towards our community are now numbered. It should be remembered that in the course of a decade, things have changed considerably in favour of the depressed classes and there is also a very strong awakening among the depressed classes themselves,” he further said. Rao Bahadur M.C. Rajah’s thoughts have been uncomfortably native and Hindu, similar to those of other leading figures of the Dalit movement, such as Divan Bahadur Rettamalai Srinivasan and the great Yati, Swami Sahajananda. I would attribute this as the primary reason these great leaders have failed to find their rightful place today. M.C. Rajah started off with the anti-Brahmin Justice Party but soon found it to be anti-depressed classes, too, and exited it. In his presidential address at the second South Indian Adi Dravida Congress in Kovilpatti, July 21-22, 1925, he said, “Now under the Reform Council consisting as it does of a large majority of the so-called Justice Party, what has been done? The council cut down or allotment of money in the very first year of its existence by one lakh rupees and thus deprived the Department of opportunities of relieving distress among the poor, and in its second year removed all the important and functioning officials of the government. Need I remind you how this outrageous procedure crippled all the resources of the department and thank God it is not to be in existence much longer in its third year. Their natural animosity towards us was patent even before the labour troubles in Madras, the cause and effect of which will be fresh in your minds.” In 1925, M.C. Rajah wanted the Justice Party government to install a mid-day meal scheme that would benefit and encourage students from the depressed classes. His suggestion was placed before the Finance Committee with an arbitrarily drawn estimate of Rs 67 lakh per annum, without any study or examination and was left to fail. Such was the Justice Party’s love for the upliftment of the depressed classes. He was scathing when it came to discussing the reforms and policies of the Justice Party, the forerunner of today’s Dravidian parties. He said, “It has been clearly pointed out that so early in the history of the reforms in Southern India, the non-Brahman Caste Hindu Party in the local council, who posed as the guardians of the depressed classes, has been not only practically arresting the progress of a community which forms the backbone of the labouring population, but has also been crushing its hopes and aspirations.” M.C. Rajah was a towering leader who aimed to elevate his community to great heights. He believed that Hinduism could reform itself from within. While he was not satisfied with the speed at which the reforms were progressing, he was confident that the Dalit community would soon receive its rightful due. He also believed that providing education and strengthening the finances of the Dalit community would accelerate social reforms and bring about changes in society much faster. He was not called a Perunthalaivar , or Great Leader, without reason. All things considered, it is a shame that we do not celebrate a leader of M.C. Rajah’s stature as we should today. He achieved things that were difficult even for someone born with a silver spoon. We understand that his staunchly Hindu and vocally anti-Justice Party outlook has ensured that the Dravidian curtain blocks his name and works from being widely known to society. செயற்கரிய செய்வார் பெரியர் சிறியர் செயற்கரிய செய்கலா தார் Seyarkariya Seivaar Periyar Siriyar Seyarkariya Seikala Thar -Tirukkural, Chapter 3, Kural 26 The great ones are they who can achieve the impossible: the feeble ones are those who cannot – The Kural or The Maxims of Thiruvalluvar by VVS Aiyar.

    "article_content": "Written By : Priyadarshi Dutta News18.com Last Updated: June 19, 2024, 14:08 IST New Delhi, India Ultra-Orthodox Jewish people block a tram in protest against attempts to change government policy that grants ultra-Orthodox Jews exemptions from military conscription. (Reuters) In the midst of Israel’s ‘war to end all wars’- the military campaign in Gaza to finish Hamas – a proposed legislation has the Zionist country in ferment. The matter has reached a tipping point with Pnina Tamano-Shata, a Member of the Knesset, representing the National Unity Party, a part of the ruling coalition, submitting a bill to dissolve the 25 th Knesset, and have fresh elections with broad consensus by October. At the heart of the debate is a draft bill pertaining to extending military conscription to Haredim, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community that conventionally refuses to participate in Israel’s military defence. All Israeli resident citizens, both male and female, are obliged to serve in the military for a period of 24 to 32 months. The actual service length might vary according to the recruit’s age, gender or professional training in medicine/dentistry. The ultra-Orthodox Haredi Jews, in addition to Israeli Arabs, are exempted from the compulsory draft. Though there is no specific law in force to exempt Haredi Jews, they are permitted a one-year deferral at a time, if they enroll themselves in yeshiva (Jewish religious seminaries) for the study of Torah. This convention has come down since the early days of Israel (estd. 1948) as per an understanding reached between the first Prime Minister Ben Gurion and leaders of the Haredim community. A 2019 document from the US Law Library of Congress says that in consideration of the destruction of yeshiva in Europe due to the Holocaust, the goal of deferral was to prevent the closing of yeshiva in Israel due to their students being drafted into the armed forces. The situation improved within a few decades, and in 1998, a Supreme Court judgement held that religious schools were flourishing in Israel, and there was little reason to worry that the draft of yeshiva students into the armed forces would lead to the closure of those institutions. However, politics almost always triumphs over principles when it comes to Israel’s coalition-based democracy. The general opinion is that Netanyahu is merely wasting time. He is trying to placate his coalition partners – the Shas Party and United Torah Judaism. These two political parties, representing the bulk of the Haredi community’s vote, together contribute 18 seats in the Knesset, which is vital for the survival of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. In May 2000, the Ehud Barak government saw two of its coalition partners viz. the secular Meretz party and ultra-Orthodox Shas party at loggerheads, over a budget cut to yeshiva . Meretz threatened to quit the coalition. Education Minister Yossi Sarid, belonging to Meretz, sobbed on camera even as mayors from around Israel requested to stay on. “What is my message to the children,” said Sarid, “that there are no limits, no principles” as reported by The Economist dated May 13, 2000 (P.49). Sarid had threatened to stop the budget for yeshiva , unless they decided to carry out administrative reforms. However, yeshiva are pocket boroughs of the Shas Party, which commanded 17 seats in the Knesset as against Meretz’s 10. Thus, Meretz had to quit Barak’s cabinet. However, the Shas Party also left within a month, though over a different issue. Barak survived a no-confidence motion in the Knesset by a slender margin of seven as he departed to Camp David for Mid-East Peace Talks in July 2000. The Tal Law (2002) was an attempt to provide a statutory authorisation to the Minister of Defence to approve yeshiva students’ draft deferments for a period limited to five years. However, a decade later, in February 2012, the Supreme Court struck down the Tal Law as unconstitutional. Thus, there is a legal vacuum on the subject. The draft bill in question has divided the government as much as the country. His critics see Benjamin Netanyahu as trying to build a halfway house that would not fulfill the actual needs of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). The original bill was introduced by Benjamin “Benny” Gantz, the then defence minister, in the government of Naftali Bennett in August 2022. The bill was not targeted at Haredi Jews specifically, but intended to lay down a wider “Israeli Service Plan”, which would oblige all sectors of Israeli society to conduct national service in some form or the other. The bill, which passed the first reading, lowered the conscription age for ultra-Orthodox to 21 years, but for a maximum of two years. According to it, a 21-year-old Haredi could join the national emergency and rescue services and receive vocational training. This measure would have also equipped the Haredi youths to integrate with the job market later. According to proposed changes in the bill, the exemption age would rise to 22 years and then to 23 a year later. On the other hand, the budget for yeshiva would be cut by 20 per cent in the beginning. This would be followed by more significant cuts, but only if the recruitment targets fall short for successive years. These targets are 15 per cent (of students from yeshiva background), 25 per cent by 2030, and 35 per cent from 2036. The proposal allows two recruitment routes for the Haredi community to join the IDF: a three-week shortened service or a three-month service, after which soldiers transfer to reserved service. Both Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, and Benny Gantz, the proposer of the original bill (2022) (now a minister without portfolio in Netanyahu cabinet), have expressed outrage with the current bill. They find the bill unrealistic, which fails to meet the gap between the demand and supply. The operational demands of the IDF have surged since the beginning of the campaign in Gaza last October. That the ultra-Orthodox Haredis would evade the obligation to defend the state, whose patronage they liberally enjoy, has left much of Israel fuming. While Hamas, deeply inspired by Islamic theology, is overtly committed to the destruction of Israel, it is paradoxical that ultra-Orthodox Jews shirk from their responsibility of defending the Jewish state. This might prove that while Islam is a militarised religion, Judaism is essentially a peaceful creed. “And they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore” (Isiah 2:4), says the Old Testament. This verse inspired Evgeny Vuchetich (1908-1974) to sculpt his famous bronze statue which stands on the ground outside of the United Nations Building in New York. It was gifted by the USSR to the global body in December, 1959. Even the godless USSR could not ignore the message contained in the Old Testament. The ultra-Orthodox Jews claim that reading the Torah, or the first five books of the Hebrew Bible pertaining to Jewish law, is more important than serving in the armed forces. They argue that reciting the Torah in times of war protects the nation. This argument appears not only illogical but also disingenuous according to the standards of the Bible itself. The God of Old Testament did not allow the priestly classes a leave of absence from the battlefield. Where the Pentateuch of Torah viz. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy cease, the active duty of Torah scholars begins, that is in the Book of Joshua. The Levitical priests, who were ordained as teachers of law, carried the Ark of the Covenant, the most sacred relic in the Hebrew Bible, when Israelites under the leadership of Joshua began the final assault to wrest the Holy Land after wandering in the deserts for forty years. In a willing suspension of disbelief, one feels amazed that when the Levitical priests, bearing the Ark of Covenant which contained the inscribed version of the Torah, dipped their feet into the river Jordan, the river stopped its flow and its water piled up in a heap, so that the Israelites could pass over through the dry bed of the river. Thereafter when Joshua, the leader of Israelites, mounted a campaign on the walled city of Jericho, seven priests blowing shofar (trumpet made from ram’s horn) walked in front of the Levitical priests who carried the Ark of Covenant, while the rest followed them in utter silence. This routine continued for six days, as per instructions of the God of Old Testament, until on the seventh after the blowing of the shofar , the Israelites together gave a loud shout, and the walls of Jericho fell down all at once (Joshua: 1-27). That is as far as the scriptures go to prove that the God of Old Testament did not perceive an armchair role for practitioners of Torah in times of campaign. “Read, whilst you arm you; arm you, whilst you read” – the advice of Torquato Tasso in his epic poem Jerusalem Delivered ( 1581 ) might hold good for the ultra-Orthodox Jews.

    "article_content": "Written By : Dr K Madan Gopal & Dr Sachin Shah News18.com Last Updated: June 19, 2024, 14:40 IST New Delhi, India India has made remarkable progress in immunisation, achieving significant milestones. (Image: Shutterstock) Vaccines have come a long way since Dr Edward Jenner first inoculated an eight-year-old boy against smallpox in 1796. Over the past three centuries, vaccines have revolutionised healthcare, saving over 154 million lives. A recent Lancet study shows immunisation has added 10.2 billion years of healthy life in the last fifty years. On average, each vaccination adds about 66 years of healthy life, promising a healthier future for everyone. This is not just a medical achievement, but a testament to our collective resilience and dedication to healthcare, a source of inspiration for all. Immunisation has had a significant impact on India’s population. For example, thanks to polio immunisation, 20 million people in India who might otherwise be paralysed can walk. Since 1974, the EPI has boosted global newborn immunisation coverage against DTP from 5 per cent to 84 per cent in India. India has made remarkable progress in immunisation, achieving significant milestones. The nation eradicated polio in 2014 and neonatal and maternal tetanus in 2015. Initiatives like Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) were crucial to this success. According to HMIS data, these efforts increased full immunisation coverage from 44 per cent in 2005-06 to 89 per cent in 2021-22. Tackling vaccine hesitancy, especially in rural areas, posed a challenge. However, India implemented effective strategies to address this. IMI phases focused on community engagement and mobilisation, using traditional and social media, regular community meetings, and tools like the “My Village My Home” (MVMH) campaign in Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. This campaign tracked each child’s vaccination status, significantly improving coverage and timeliness. Government agencies, NGOs, community leaders, and volunteers have worked together to promote immunisation effectively. Bihar’s “Muskaan Ek Abhiyan” (Smile Campaign) is a successful example. This approach increased community awareness, budgetary support, supervision, and beneficiary tracking and offered performance-based incentives for service providers. Educational interventions for school children and young mothers also boosted efforts in the state. Another critical initiative, Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) 3.0, launched in February 2021, targets 250 high-focus districts across 29 states and Union Territories. This program aims to reach every child and pregnant woman who missed routine immunisation due to the Covid pandemic, addressing disparities in coverage and ensuring no one is left behind. Technological innovations like the eVIN system have revolutionised vaccine logistics, providing real-time data on stocks and storage and ensuring vaccine quality. This system provides real-time information on vaccine stocks and storage temperatures across all cold chain points in the country, ensuring vaccine quality and availability. Digital platforms like the CoWIN app, initially developed for Covid vaccination, have been adapted to support routine immunisation programs. These platforms facilitate efficient beneficiary registration, vaccination tracking, and data management, streamlining immunisation. By leveraging such technologies, India can enhance the reach and effectiveness of its immunisation campaigns. Despite our triumphs, we still face hurdles such as vaccine reluctance, logistical challenges, and socioeconomic considerations that contribute to incomplete immunisation. Addressing these issues necessitates a multidimensional strategy that includes technology, community participation, and policy assistance. The Immunisation Agenda 2030 aims for “zero-dose” status, ensuring every child gets essential vaccinations, especially in remote and rural areas. WHO-UNICEF estimates show 63 per cent of zero-dose children live in Bihar, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. To achieve this, India must innovate and adapt by extending digital platforms, improving cold chain logistics, and enhancing community participation. Increased cash allocations for immunisation programmes, as well as greater international collaboration, will help these efforts. Next-generation vaccine research, requiring fewer doses or providing broader protection, can potentially advance immunisation tactics. International collaboration would be critical in sharing best practices and resources and keeping India at the forefront of global immunisation efforts. India’s journey towards universal immunisation demonstrates the strength of consistent commitment, inventive initiatives, and dedicated healthcare personnel. By prioritising these efforts, we can secure a healthier future for all Indian children. Achieving the Immunisation Agenda 2030 will necessitate continued dedication and teamwork, but the benefits—a healthier, more resilient population—are well worth the effort. We must continue to support immunisation activities by raising awareness, participating in local campaigns, and pressing for more funding and resources. This collaborative effort can close the immunisation gap and pave the road for a healthy future for everybody.

    "article_content": "Written By : Abhinav Mehrotra and Dr Biswanath Gupta News18.com Last Updated: June 19, 2024, 16:14 IST New Delhi, India Following his re-election, Prime Minister Modi's first foreign visit was to Italy for the G7 Summit, which concluded on June 15 in Borgo Egnazia, Apulia. (AFP Photo) In the recent Indian elections, a new government has been formed under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He received congratulatory phone calls from world leaders, including US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who commended him for leading the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to victory in the parliamentary election. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also took to X (formerly Twitter) to congratulate Modi on the NDA’s victory. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni were among other leaders who congratulated Modi on X. Furthermore, several South Asian leaders attended Prime Minister Modi’s oath-taking ceremony, including heads of state from Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka. This demonstrates international recognition of the new government. Following his re-election, Prime Minister Modi’s first foreign visit was to Italy for the G7 Summit, which concluded on June 15 in Borgo Egnazia, Apulia. This visit highlights the significance of international recognition for elected governments. It is a fundamental principle of international law that every independent state has the right to be represented on the world stage by its government. This holds true for India with the newly elected NDA government. International law dictates that the recognised government must be one that effectively governs its people and maintains authority within its borders. Although no international judicial or executive body definitively determines statehood, the recognition of foreign governments typically falls under the purview of individual countries’ executive branches. This recognition by the international community is not merely symbolic; it is a duty enshrined in international law, carrying significant weight in shaping international rights and duties for the recognised government. The recognition of a government is a matter of international law, distinct from the recognition of a state. State recognition is a more complex undertaking than government recognition. Generally, there are two modes of recognition: de facto recognition and de jure recognition. A state or government may be granted either de facto or de jure recognition. Granting de facto recognition indicates that the recognised state or government possesses the essential attributes of statehood and is fit to be a subject of international law. Conversely, de jure recognition is granted when the recognising state is satisfied with the effective control demonstrated by the government previously granted de facto recognition. Generally, de jure recognition follows de facto recognition. It is legal and permanent; once granted, it cannot be withdrawn. The international recognition of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government following India’s recent parliamentary elections underscores the importance of such acknowledgements on the world stage. The congratulatory messages from world leaders and Modi’s participation in the G7 Summit exemplify the practical implications of international law concerning government recognition. This case study highlights the significance of government recognition and the legal frameworks underpinning these diplomatic practices.

    "article_content": "Written By : Ravi Kant News18.com Last Updated: June 19, 2024, 17:39 IST New Delhi, India Despite the law being so clear, almost one in every four children in India is still being pushed into early and illegal marriage.(Representational Image) It is war that gives birth to weapons. How sharp or clandestine the weapons depend on who and what we are fighting against. So when about 200 NGOs combatting child marriage in the villages or districts of India chalk out a strategy that fights the ritual but befriends the people, their war plan has to be humane, intricate, smart, and traditional. They need to make indigenous plans, rope in locals, echo the sentiments of the community, and yet weave in the right message without hurting the majority’s sentiments or sounding like outsiders. They can’t be too loud, lest it sounds offensive, but they can’t whisper, lest the message gets lost. This fine balance is the challenge, and these civil society organisations have admirably been able to strike it with much aplomb. Yes, this Akshaya Tritiya, an otherwise auspicious day which often becomes a curse for children who are pushed into marriages, these NGOs fought with fire to save vulnerable children from getting married. These NGOs, which are all coalition partners of the Child Marriage Free India campaign and have been working at the grassroots in over 400 districts across the country, did manage to protect children from getting married this year on Akshaya Tritiya. The day was auspicious indeed! The NGOs are working in tandem with village panchayats (village heads) and district administrations in this fight. In fact, in a recent order, the Rajasthan High Court also affixed the responsibility of child marriages on the village heads in the state. The high court was hearing a petition filed by the Just Rights For Children Alliance, ahead of Akshaya Tritiya. It is an interesting and apt way to fight the crime that child marriage is. The laws in the country on child marriage are clear. The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 clearly states that whoever performs, conducts, directs or abets any child marriage shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment, which may extend to two years, and shall be liable to a fine, which may extend to Rs 1 lakh. Despite the law being so clear, almost one in every four children in India is still being pushed into early and illegal marriage. This alarming figure is a sore point for a nation marking its global footprint in almost all fields, from science and technology to diplomatic relations and international trade. Both the Central and state governments have been showing determination and commitment to uproot this crime from society, and while the impact is immense and far-reaching, the question remains if it is reaching deep enough to hit child marriage right where it rests in our society. For example, as the vigil has grown, so has the villagers’ tactics to commit this crime right under the scanner. An NGO partner of the Child Marriage Free India campaign working in Rajasthan recently said that now that the villagers are aware of the crackdown, child marriage often coincides with a death in the family. “Since there are already relatives in the house and no one suspects anything, villagers often clandestinely marry off their children right after the burial rituals have been completed. This way they easily ward off any suspicion from anyone,” the NGO working in the grassroots of Rajasthan said. Similarly, since the drive to prevent child marriages on the auspicious day of Akshaya Tritiya is often very intense, villagers have been using ‘Peepal Puniya’ as the auspicious time to commit this crime. ‘Peepal Puniya’ is the 14-day period after Akshaya Tritiya which is also considered quite auspicious and perfect for marriages. So, roping in the village heads who are in the know of things, and working in tandem with district administrations will help the message reach every households. Reaching the last mile and making the message heard by the weakest links in society is possible only when the panchayats take up the charge of bringing about a social change as challenging as ending child marriage. Panchayats bringing in such a monumental change is neither overly ambitious nor impractical. History is proof enough that panchayats in our villages have, time and again, achieved what laws and policies alone could have taken much longer to accomplish. In 2020, the villagers of Simrahi Tola of Sakaldeepa panchayat in Palamau district of Jharkhand were facing a difficult time crossing over a turbulent rivulet. Even the nearest medical facility, which was 12 km away, became difficult to access due to the river. Taking a cue from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, the villagers did not wait any longer for the sanctions to come through and made a 25-foot bamboo strip bridge which immediately became the lifeline of the villagers there. Let’s look at another instance to gauge the power of panchayats in our country. As part of the Centre’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the Goa chief minister in 2019 sought the active support of all panchayat bodies to make the state open defecation-free (ODF) in a month. The result: the state announced that all village panchayat areas are now open defecation-free (ODF). The success of the Pulse Polio Immunisation (PPI) in India stands on the pillars of our panchayats, village heads, Anganwadi and Asha workers. So, the fact that the entire onus of making India child marriage-free by 2030 is being equally shared by the village panchayats is an extremely promising and strategic move. Child marriage, as a socially accepted practice, has been embedded in our country’s fabric for centuries. While there have been laws, initiatives, and actions to combat this social crime, these measures haven’t been enough. The fight against child marriage can only be won if we target this dangerous societal mindset. The collective synergy of these NGOs, along with the will and work of village panchayats, district administrations, and the communities themselves, is how this mindset can change. For the mind to be free, fair, and just, the fight must be inclusive, intense, and tailor-made. Ravi Kant, is Convenor, Child Marriage Free India.

    "article_content": "Written By : Kausar Kidwai News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 11:50 IST New Delhi, India Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) continues to be a major public health problem in India and impacts the prognosis of cancer patients significantly. The focus of the government towards promoting the overall well-being of women has started bearing fruits. The convergence of several government schemes and policies are gradually impacting the lives and is providing the much-needed freedom of decision-making to women. Whilst the ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ (Save the girl, Educate the girl) initiative is thriving on the broader vision of gender equality, addressing the declining child sex ratio, promoting education and empowering girls; Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana scheme — aimed to provide free LPG connections to women from below-poverty-line families — is promoting clean cooking and improving health. Similarly, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, a savings scheme for the girl child, is encouraging parents to save for their daughter’s future and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan — while not exclusive to women — is campaigning for clean sanitation facilities. This has had a significant impact on the health and dignity of women. While the Indian government has made commendable efforts to prioritise women’s issues, there still remains a critical need for intensified focus on women’s health. Addressing prevalent health issues such as anaemia, and malnutrition, and concerted efforts towards combating prevalent non-communicable diseases, including breast and cervical cancers, is much needed. Screening programs and awareness campaigns can contribute to early detection and improved outcomes. With annual mortality of over 916,827 and an incidence of over 1.4 million , cancer has rapidly grown into one of the leading drivers of mortality and morbidity in India. Late detection and inadequate access to quality treatment imply that outcomes are despairingly poorer as compared to developed countries. Not surprisingly, even cancers such as those of breast, cervical and oral that are amenable to screening and early detection account for over 33 per cent of the incidence and 28 per cent of the mortality. The challenges vis-à-vis cervical cancer are even more acute. With an incidence of approximately 127,526 and a mortality of over 79,906 in 2022, it is the second leading cause of cancer amongst women, accounting for 17.7 per cent of cancer burden (by incidence). Poor awareness and knowledge gaps, limited geographic (limited availability and concentration of cancer services) and economic access (low insurance penetration and high cost of treatment in the private sector) to quality screening and treatment services, further magnified by gender-related issues and privacy concerns, are significant barriers in accessing care. In India, the overall pooled data of cervical cancer five-year survival (between 2012 and 2015) was 51.7 per cent . The number of cervical cancer cases prevalent for five years is approximately 339,589 women. The National Sample Survey’s (NSS) 75 th round conducted during July 2017-June 2018 revealed an alarming picture associated with cancer care in India. Based on data recently released, at the national level, average total cancer care expenditure was around Rs 1,16,218 and 93 per cent of this (Rs 1,08,659 out of Rs 1,16,218) is out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure. Late-stage diagnosis is common due to limited awareness and healthcare infrastructure, leading to reduced treatment efficacy and higher mortality. Globally, every fourth woman dying from the disease is Indian; we lose 218 women to cervical cancer every day in India. Whilst this is a matter of grave concern, we can’t ignore the elephant in the room – anaemia. Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) continues to be a major public health problem in India and impacts the prognosis of cancer patients significantly. It is estimated that about 20 per cent of maternal deaths are directly related to anaemia and another 50 per cent of maternal deaths are associated with it. The question, therefore, is why, despite being the first country to launch the National Nutritional Aanaemia Prophylaxis Programme in 1970, the problem of IDA remains so widespread. As is to be expected, the economic implications of IDA are also massive. Furthermore, anaemia of chronic disease — the second most prevalent anaemia — is caused by iron deficiency which happens in patients with acute or chronic immune activation. Cancer patients with anaemia also face emotional and mental costs in addition to lack of self-motivation, sorrow, frustration and mental collapse. Almost one patient with malignancy in two is anaemic, with the consequence of poorer treatment outcomes and quality of life. A low haemoglobin (Hb) level seems to directly affect treatment efficacy, predominantly of radiotherapy, probably due to low tissue oxygenation causing decrease in radio-sensitivity. Tissue hypoxia might also enable tumour progression and impair the efficacy of cytostatic drugs. The world is continuously combating this problem despite the fact that these problems are largely preventable and easily treatable. Cervical cancer has a long pre-cancerous window during which it can be identified, and pre-cancerous lesions treated, thereby preventing progression to cancer. Screening and treatment of pre-cancerous lesions are amenable to decentralisation and can potentially be undertaken at primary and secondary-level facilities. In November 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced a global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem. This, amongst other interventions, recommends that 70 per cent of women be screened for cervical cancer by 35 years of age, and to ensure that 90 per cent of women identified with cervical disease receive treatment. Anaemia has shown increase in all age groups from 2015-16 to 2019-21, which impacts the overall lifecycle approach. While anaemia and cervical health may not have a direct causal relationship, they can be interconnected in several ways. Anaemia is a condition characterised by a lack of red blood cells or haemoglobin in the blood, leading to reduced oxygen-carrying capacity. Cervical health, on the other hand, often refers to the well-being of the cervix, particularly in the context of conditions like cervical cancer. Anaemia and cervical health may be related in one or many ways: Impact on Immune Function : Anaemia can compromise the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections, including those affecting the reproductive organs. This may indirectly influence cervical health. Menstrual Irregularities : Anaemia is often associated with heavy menstrual bleeding, which can affect cervical health. Prolonged or heavy periods may increase the risk of certain gynaecological issues. Nutritional Factors : Both anaemia and poor cervical health can be influenced by nutritional factors. Adequate iron levels are crucial for overall health, including the maintenance of healthy blood and tissues. Reduced Oxygen Supply : Anaemia results in reduced oxygen delivery to various tissues in the body, and this can impact the health of cells, including those in the cervix. Oxygen is essential for cellular function and repair. Health Disparities : Socioeconomic factors that contribute to anaemia may also be associated with limited access to healthcare services, which can impact cervical health. Initiatives like the National Rural Livelihood Mission may play a role in addressing these disparities. It’s important to note that while these connections exist, addressing anaemia and promoting cervical health often involve distinct medical and public health strategies. Regular screenings for cervical cancer, maintaining a nutritious diet, and addressing anaemia through appropriate medical interventions are essential components of overall health and well-being. Regular screenings play a vital role in identifying cancer at its initial stages, enabling timely interventions and improved treatment outcomes (National Cancer Institute). As per NFHS-5, only 1-2 per cent of citizens of the country have ever undergone screening for oral, breast and cervical cancer. Given the government’s focus on screening 37 per cent of India’s population, add-on solutions are required to complement the efforts of the government. Introducing ‘Digital Wellness Centres’ for non-communicable diseases (NCD) and anaemia testing to conduct the first level of screening will aid in risk stratification rather than age stratification of the population and effectively lead to reduced ramifications of these diseases. Additionally, risk stratification will reduce patient load and enable better quality screenings/services and improve disease outcomes. The Economic Survey 2022-23 has a special mention of high-impact banking operations done by self-help group (SHG) members, leading to the disbursement of billions of rupees every year. As India boasts of 12 million odd SHGs, leveraging this platform is paramount towards seeding the concept of wellness in the community. India grapples with a strained patient-nurse ratio, urging the incorporation of a parallel cadre, such as NRLM members, to emphasise holistic wellness. By diversifying roles, these members can proactively engage in preventive healthcare, reducing illness rates. This innovative approach not only optimises healthcare resources but also fosters a community-centric strategy in mitigating the burden on the healthcare system. With concerted efforts and determination, the first Digital Wellness Centre was set up in Madhya Pradesh under a pilot project led by Karkinos Healthcare, Career Institute of Medical Sciences and Vishwanath Cancer Care Foundation (VCCF) with CSR support from LT Foods. Anita Ahirwar, a member of the consortium and a SHG member herself, believes that it has triggered conversations about individual and family well-being. They are not willing to be manipulated by the hands of the local quacks. She understands generic medication is capable of providing affordable healthcare services. Her group was identified as local brand champions and they believe more such centres can be set up if advocacy regarding anaemia and cancer is scaled up. Health entrepreneurship within SHGs is a powerful example of grassroots initiatives promoting healthcare access and economic independence. Health clinics set up by NRLM members not only serve as a means to provide essential healthcare services but also present a sustainable business and revenue model case. By charging nominal fees for consultations (lifestyle and dietary diversity); anaemia, diabetes, and blood pressure checkups; these clinics generate revenue to cover operational costs and even reinvest in community development initiatives. As India progresses towards comprehensive healthcare reforms, it is imperative for the government to address the pressing issue of anaemia in cancer patients. Iron deficiency remains one of the most widespread nutrient deficiencies globally, posing significant challenges to treatment outcomes, particularly in cancer care settings. Cancer patients are especially vulnerable to anaemia due to increased iron needs during treatment, exacerbating the severity of their condition. To mitigate these challenges and improve treatment efficacy, it is essential for cancer treatment centres to integrate ferrous ascorbate supplementation alongside cancer therapies. Ferrous ascorbate, along with Carbonyl iron, emerges as a promising solution, offering enhanced efficacy and improved tolerability compared to conventional iron preparations like Ferrous sulphate and Ferrous fumarate. By prioritising the implementation of ferrous ascorbate supplementation protocols in cancer care facilities, the government can significantly enhance the well-being and treatment outcomes of cancer patients. This proactive approach underscores the importance of addressing anaemia as an integral component of holistic cancer care, ensuring that patients receive comprehensive support throughout their treatment journey.

(Image: AP) While the centre-right European People’s Party was the overall victor in the recently held elections, the major gains made by far-right parties across the bloc is what has made news waves. In France, the National Rally of Marine Le Pen raked in nearly a third of the total votes, shaking the ground under President Emmanuel Macron’s feet, who immediately called for a snap election in an attempt to save his party’s prospects. More than a quarter of Italian voters, meanwhile, favoured Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party, making hers among the most resounding Conservative wins in Europe. In Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’ ruling coalition suffered a crushing blow, registering its worst performance in nearly a century. In Germany too, the Conservatives won resoundingly. While the centre-right Christian Democrats won over 30 per cent of the votes, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) finished second with 16 per cent – a gain of 5 percentage points from 2019. Apart from the centre-right European People’s Party’s 189 legislators, the far-right has emerged as the second-biggest bloc in the European parliament. The European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and the Identity and Democracy (ID) group together control 131 seats. Add to that AfD’s 15 legislators from Germany, 10 representatives of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz party, six belonging to Poland’s Confederation party, six and three from Spain’s Vox party and the far-right “Party is Over” respectively, and three members of Bulgaria’s pro-Kremlin Revival party. This takes the Conservative representation in the European parliament to over 360. There is no doubt that such numbers are bound to bring about a wider right shift in EU policy. Across Europe, right-wing parties and formations have governments in Hungary, Slovakia, Italy, Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands. The United Kingdom is another country to watch out for. Despite not being part of the EU anymore, Britain has found it hard to escape the pan-continental rise of the Right. Nigel Farage’s populist far-right Reform Party has overtaken the Tories in polling for the first time. If this trend holds till July 4, which is when the UK votes for a new government, British politics could be in for a tectonic shift. The mere thought of a far-right party eating into Conservative spheres of influence should send a shiver down the spine of Tories. The rise of the Right is hardly a phenomenon exclusive to Europe. Conservatives have emerged as a strong and resurgent political force in several democracies around the world. Most astonishing has been the victory of far-right politician, Javier Milei, in Argentina. Argentina is not alone. In Latin America, right-wing populists have made inroads in Chile, Paraguay and El Salvador as well. In the United States, Donald Trump maintains a considerable lead over Joe Biden and has a real chance of winning the presidency once again. It would not be an overstatement to suggest that Trump’s victory would further catalyse the rise of Conservatives and populists around the world, most markedly in Europe. The rise of the Right also becomes manifest by the fact that in the US, Trump’s support among black voters has witnessed a meteoric rise. A CNN analysis recently found that Trump could end up winning as much as 21 per cent of the black vote in this year’s election. That will be a nine-percentage point climb for Trump among what is largely seen as a Democrat vote bank. More importantly, Biden’s support among blacks aged below 50 years has fallen to 37 points from 80 points in 2020. Read More | Out But Not Over: Why Donald Trump Remains the Strongest Republican in America Meanwhile, here in India, Narendra Modi is back as Prime Minister – albeit with a diminished mandate, far short of what the BJP was hoping for. Notwithstanding the scale of the mandate, India still has a right-leaning, nationalist formation in power for the third straight term – a telling indicator of how Indian polity has dramatically changed since 2014. Interestingly, unless populist leaders go all-out authoritarian, they too come under the extreme pressures of anti-incumbency and risk losing power to others. While PM Modi evaded a resounding defeat, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil was not so lucky. Neither was Donald Trump in 2020. In democracies, therefore, power switching hands is inevitable. However, when the same side of the political spectrum witnesses a resurgence across the democratic world at roughly the same time, it becomes a sign of what the electorate wants from their governments. As Left-leaning parties and leaders are realising the hard way, ordinary people are not captivated by idealistic liberal notions beyond a point. While tolerance, secularism and diversity are all notions central to Europe and the Western democratic world, they are no substitutes for effective governance and handling of real issues. For Europeans, the cost-of-living crisis has gone out of hand. It is much more difficult for an average European today to make ends meet than it was in 2019. For context, while Europe’s inflation has eased significantly from the peak it registered in 2022, it is yet to return to pre-Covid levels. Essentially, Europeans have been reeling under a cost-of-living crisis for nearly three years now. Consumption has dipped as Europeans become extremely wary of spending unnecessarily, so much so that several food companies and retailers are now resorting to rampant discounting to entice consumers. However, this strategy is bearing little results. Rampant immigration and demographic change have emerged as the biggest reason behind the Right’s rise, especially in Europe. The demographic change in Europe is now visible, with refugees from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region not just arriving to European shores in hordes, but also thumping their own identity and way of living over that of original Europeans. In many ways, the rise of the Right in Europe appears to be a natural response to the brazen open-arms policy that centrist and liberal governments of the bloc, and the European Union itself have championed for years. That they are now attempting to tone down that policy themselves is a telling sign of how the mood of the average European has turned anti-immigration. Coupled with falling birth rates, deteriorating standards of living and labour shortages, the younger population of Europe is beginning to believe that if drastic corrective measures are not taken now, the opportunity may be lost forever. Conservatives, interestingly, have marketed themselves as antidotes to Europe’s biggest problems – economy and immigration. Additionally, most of the Western world has grown a real sense of fatigue when it comes to funding wars abroad. For example, people are now genuinely worried about how the national political discourse of their countries has been almost completely hijacked by external wars – those in Ukraine and West Asia. This phenomenon is becoming especially pronounced in the United States – the largest contributor to both Ukraine and Israel. The cumulative impact has been that voters are now veering towards parties that promise to fix the economy, crackdown on immigration and even undertake mass deportations, if need be. Essentially, voters want their domestic bread and butter issues to be the top priority of their governments, and not what the outcome of the war in either Eastern Europe or West Asia may be. While the Right may not have a concrete plan of action to address these issues, the mere perception that governments need to be strong-headed in confronting national challenges is becoming increasingly pronounced in the democratic world order. This is fuelling the rise of the Right in democracies around the world. Views expressed in the above piece are personal and solely those of the author.

    "article_content": "Written By : Arun Anand News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 15:14 IST New Delhi, India Bacha Khan's journey towards becoming the 'Frontier Gandhi' was paved with the principles of non-violent resistance and social reform, ideals he shared with his close ally, Mahatma Gandhi. (Wikipedia Commons) In the annals of history, certain figures emerge whose unwavering commitment to justice and peace transcends borders and ideologies. Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, affectionately known as Bacha Khan, stands as one such luminary. His life story, marked by relentless resistance against oppression and division, illuminates the dark corners of Pakistan’s troubled past and exposes the systemic failures that continue to plague the nation. Born on February 6, 1890, in a privileged Pashtun family in the heart of British India, Bacha Khan’s upbringing instilled in him a profound sense of duty towards his people and his nation. His journey towards becoming the “Sarhadi Gandhi” – the Frontier Gandhi – was paved with the principles of non-violent resistance and social reform, ideals he shared with his close ally, Mahatma Gandhi. Bacha Khan’s vision for a united India, free from the shackles of communalism, set him at odds with the proponents of the Muslim League and their divisive demand for a separate Muslim state. He foresaw the calamitous consequences of partition – the fracturing of the subcontinent and the unleashing of sectarian strife. In the 1920s, Bacha Khan founded the Khudai Khidmatgar movement, a beacon of hope in the tumultuous landscape of British India. The Red Shirts, as they were colloquially known, became an army of peaceful warriors, dedicated to the noble cause of social justice and independence. Through their tireless efforts, they challenged the hegemony of colonial rule and inspired a generation to rise against tyranny. But Bacha Khan’s unwavering commitment to a united India came at a cost. As the clouds of partition loomed large, he found himself marginalised in the newly formed state of Pakistan, where his dissenting voice was deemed a threat to the fragile narrative of nationhood. The betrayal he felt at the hands of the Indian National Congress (INC), whom he accused of abandoning him to the wolves of partition, echoed the sentiments of millions who found themselves uprooted and displaced in the wake of India’s partition. His impassioned plea for the North-West Frontier Province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas to remain part of India fell on deaf ears, as the architects of partition pursued their myopic vision of nationhood at any cost. However, Bacha Khan’s defiance did not end with the creation of Pakistan. Throughout his life, he remained a thorn in the side of the Pakistani establishment, challenging their authoritarian rule and advocating for the rights of the Pashtun people. His steadfast opposition to Pakistan’s ‘One Unit’ mission, which sought to strip the provinces of their autonomy, earned him the ire of those in power and led to his repeated imprisonment and exile. The Pakistani authorities, threatened by Bacha Khan’s unwavering resolve, employed every means at their disposal to silence him. They imprisoned him without trial, harassed his followers, and sought to erase his legacy from the pages of history. But try as they might, they could not extinguish the flame of resistance that burned within him. Bacha Khan’s legacy extends far beyond the borders of Pakistan. In India, he is revered as a champion of peace and non-violence, whose teachings continue to inspire generations of activists and freedom fighters. Yet, despite his towering stature in India, Bacha Khan remains a marginalised figure in Pakistan, relegated to the footnotes of history by a state that fears his message of unity and equality. The Pakistani establishment, blinded by their narrow vision of nationhood, failed to recognise the inherent value of Bacha Khan’s ideals and instead chose to suppress them with brute force. Today, as Pakistan grapples with the consequences of decades of authoritarian rule and sectarian violence, Bacha Khan’s words ring truer than ever. His warning that Pakistan was being thrown to the wolves has been borne out by the harsh realities of present-day Pakistan, where corruption, inequality, and injustice are rampant. The treatment meted out to Bacha Khan by the Pakistani authorities serves as a stark reminder of the state’s failure to uphold the values of democracy and human rights. His imprisonment and exile were not merely acts of repression but a concerted effort to erase his vision of a just and equitable society from the collective memory of the nation. Undoubtedly, Bacha Khan’s life story stands as a testament to the enduring power of resistance and the indomitable spirit of those who refuse to bow to tyranny. His legacy serves as a beacon of hope for all those who continue to fight for justice and equality in the face of oppression. And his words, spoken in defiance of those who sought to silence him, echo down through the corridors of history, reminding us that the struggle for freedom is never in vain. Pakistan has consistently persecuted those who expressed a desire to join India, and Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan is a prominent example of this ongoing oppression. Despite the relentless efforts of the Pakistani authorities to suppress his voice and vision, he remains a towering political figure who dedicated his life to the struggle for an independent Pashtunistan. His unwavering commitment to his cause and his courageous resistance against Pakistan’s authoritarian regime has cemented his legacy which translates into self-determination for the Pashtun people.

(AP Photo) Russian President Vladimir Putin paid a rare ‘friendly state visit’ to North Korea on June 19, bolstering a geopolitical realignment with significant implications. Dictatorial leaders, both the host and the guest, preside over heavily sanctioned nations that are at odds with the industrialised world. Both are nuclear powers — one de jure , possessing the largest number of warheads and the other, de facto . One of them is at war with its smaller Western neighbour, and the other has been threatening to inflict one on its southern half. The countries share a short, approximately 40-km-long land and maritime border. That is where the similarities end. Russia is the largest country in the world, straddling two continents and covering an area of 17.1 million square kilometres, a former superpower and a permanent member of the UN Security Council. In comparison, North Korea is a tiny nation, with a landmass of merely 120,000 square kilometres. Isolated and impoverished, it would barely figure in the global consciousness were it not for its weapons of mass destruction and potential for mischief. It has been a fiefdom of three generations of the ruthless Kim clan since 1948. Historically, it has been propped up by Moscow and Beijing, at times individually and sometimes jointly, as is the case now. Traditionally, Moscow has held court and Pyongyang has come calling. Kim Jong Un has already visited Russia twice to ingratiate himself with Putin. The latter paid a brief visit to North Korea in July 2000, soon after taking office during the reign of Kim Jong Un’s father. North Korea has always looked up to Russia (earlier the Soviet Union) for political, economic and military support. That had begun to dwindle in recent times, due to Russia’s own resource constraints and the emergence of China as a major economic and military power. Nevertheless, the Kims have been steadfast in cultivating and leveraging relations with both their giant neighbours. The relationship has not always been smooth. A fiercely independent Pyongyang has charted its own course, at times against the wishes of Russia and China, particularly when it comes to its own security. For example, it conducted six nuclear tests, which were strongly condemned by the comity of nations. It caused embarrassment and concern in both Moscow and Beijing. Neither country is comfortable with North Korea becoming a nuclear weapon state, as it could set off a chain reaction with Seoul and Tokyo following suit. At the same time, they do not want to see the collapse of the Kim regime or its replacement by one that is pro-Western. As such, until recently, both countries had gone along with the US-led efforts to denuclearise the Korean peninsula, even at the cost of annoying North Korea. That cooperative approach has since been abandoned with the fraying of Moscow’s and Beijing’s ties with the industrialised nations. In March this year, Russia exercised its veto at the UN Security Council (UNSC) to put an end to the monitoring of sanctions on North Korea by a panel of experts appointed by the international body. It opined that the sanctions were strangling Pyongyang and that the panel of experts was playing into the West’s hands by peddling biased information and focusing on “trivial matters that are not commensurate with the problems facing the peninsula”. Hitherto, for fourteen years, Moscow had never objected to the panel’s work. So, what changed? The straightforward answer is – Ukraine war. Moscow suddenly rediscovered the utility of its highly militarised tiny neighbour. If Western voices are to be believed, North Korea has already provided 11,000 container loads of armaments and munitions, including missiles and artillery shells, critical for the Russian offensive in Ukraine. Kim has since become an indispensable ally of Putin, who needs to be kept in good humour. The grateful Russian Czar even gifted an Aurus Senat limousine to Kim, a car he himself uses. It mattered little that luxury cars are a proscribed item for the North under UN sanctions. The Ukraine war could not have come at a more opportune time for Kim, who is treated as a pariah by most world leaders. He had been dealing with a failed summit with former US President Donald Trump, and neglect by current US President Joe Biden. Adding to his woes were increasingly aggressive and sophisticated joint military exercises by South Korea, the US and Japan, the reintroduction of US strategic assets (read nukes) in the Korean theatre, a stuttering economy bruised by the Covid pandemic and severe shortages of food and fuel. Bitter and frustrated, Kim Jong Un pulled out all stops in advancing his weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programme, conducting 68 missile tests, the highest ever in 2022. Speculation was rife that he would carry out the country’s seventh nuclear test inter alia to validate the efficacy of its miniaturised nuclear warheads. Fortunately, that has not happened till date, though the possibility still cannot be ruled out. Some Western analysts believe that a dramatic provocation could be staged by Pyongyang, possibly in October just before the US presidential elections on November 5. It is difficult to anticipate the shape or form it may take. The North can be ingeniously innovative. In recent weeks, for example, they despatched hundreds of giant balloons floating into South Korean airspace filled with filth and garbage, which mercifully did not contain any hazardous substances, but caused enough anxiety among the citizens. Earlier in January, Kim denounced South Korea as the ‘primary enemy’, abandoned the goal of reunification, cut off inter-Korean communication channels, shuttered all three agencies responsible for overseeing relations with the South and ordered the dismantling of the monument of reunification in Pyongyang. He also scrapped the Comprehensive Military Agreement (CMA) signed in November 2018, in which both Koreas had agreed on several confidence-building measures in the security domain. In November 2023, President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea had partially suspended CMA in response to the launch of its first spy satellite by Pyongyang (also in November). This is the background in which the visit took place. President Putin was accompanied by his Deputy PM Denis Mantrurov, Defence Minister Andrei Belousov and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, among other senior officials. He was greeted in person by Kim Jong Un at the tarmac on arrival. A rapturous welcome followed in the city. Pyongyang was dolled up in honour of the visiting dignitary. As widely anticipated, the sides concluded a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement which includes a mutual defence pact, significantly committing them to extend “mutual assistance in the event of aggression against one of the parties”. Both countries have described the agreement as “a truly breakthrough document”. Cooperation in other areas such as energy, trade, investment, transport, agriculture, tourism and culture, reportedly, were also discussed. Predictably, Western capitals are concerned about the development. It is a fact that Putin’s visit and conclusion of the strategic partnership agreement would have far-reaching implications. First and foremost, it has boosted Kim’s standing within the country and abroad. Two, the sanctions regime on North Korea that was gasping for air has been effectively buried. Three, Russia has secured a reliable supply line for armaments and munitions, which it cannot have enough of, as an end to the Ukraine war is nowhere in sight. Four, besides receiving food, fuel and other essentials, North Korea would surely pitch for advanced military technology to upgrade its nuclear weapon, missile and space program. Five, Pyongyang’s stance towards ROK (South Korea) and its allies would harden, further accentuating tensions in the Korean peninsula. It is obvious that necessity and adversity have propelled the sides closer. As their ties with the West are unlikely to improve anytime soon, the Moscow-Pyongyang bonhomie, even if transactional, is likely to endure. Former US President Bush had famously called North Korea, Iran and Iraq an ‘Axis of Evil’. One wonders what he may have to say about the new ‘Axis of Defiance’ comprising China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, which has materialised in no small part due to the West’s own policies.

    "article_content": "Written By : Tuhin A Sinha News18.com Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 11:18 IST New Delhi, India PM Modi’s efforts in making yoga a crucial part of India’s cultural legacy and pride deserve applause. (Image: PTI File) Since its inception on June 21, 2015, International Yoga Day has grown in popularity and acceptance worldwide. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been a relentless yoga advocate, leading Yoga Day celebrations from different locations each year, and promoting its benefits at every opportunity. Many Indians may not know why Yoga Day is celebrated on June 21. Lord Shiva, also known as Adiyogi, is considered the originator of yoga, and the summer solstice on June 21 marks its beginning. The story goes that Lord Shiva meditated blissfully for years, ignoring everyone. However, seven disciples remained patient, determined to learn from him. After 84 years, on the summer solstice, Shiva finally noticed them. On the next full moon, 28 days later, he became the Adiguru (the first guru) and taught the science of yoga to these disciples – the Saptarishis – who then spread it to the world. Thus, June 21 was naturally chosen for Yoga Day. The idea of an International Day of Yoga was first proposed by PM Modi during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on September 27, 2014. He said: “Yoga is an invaluable gift of India’s ancient tradition. It embodies unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfillment; harmony between man and nature; and a holistic approach to health and well-being. It is not about exercise but about discovering the sense of oneness with yourself, the world, and nature. By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help in well-being. Let us work towards adopting an International Yoga Day.” Following this speech, the first Yoga Day was celebrated worldwide within months. Since then, the number of people practicing yoga has grown exponentially. Globally, the interest in yoga is driven by two social trends: the rapidly increasing elderly population and the surge in digital consumption across all age groups, each presenting unique health challenges. The acceptance of yoga across all age groups comes at an opportune time. Reports indicate a significant demographic shift, with the elderly population increasing dramatically. According to the Technical Group on Population Projections for India and States 2011-2036, there were nearly 138 million elderly persons in India in 2021, a number expected to rise by 56 million by 2031. By 2050, there will be over 319 million elderly people, three times the number identified by the 2011 Census, according to the Longitudinal Ageing Study of India (LASI). This elderly generation, often part of nuclear and single-child families, is more vulnerable to age-related health concerns. For them, adopting yoga timely offers significant wellness benefits, and PM Modi’s enthusiastic promotion has likely encouraged more elderly people to embrace yoga. Additionally, the overwhelming increase in digital consumption from early schooling years is leading to more eye, brain, and nerve-related medical issues. Yoga offers remedies through various mudras for the eyes and face, which can help restore balance amid excessive screen time. Notably, the Congress party has consistently avoided acknowledging Yoga Day, possibly due to their disdain for PM Modi or a disregard for India’s cultural legacy. Yoga is as much a part of India’s cultural identity as taekwondo is for Korea or salsa for Mexico. Any political group that undermines the country’s strengths suffers from an inferiority complex and self-deprecating attitude, overtly visible in today’s Congress party. Under PM Modi, yoga has become a powerful and integral component of India’s soft power globally. His dedicated efforts each year have expanded yoga’s outreach, allowing more people worldwide to benefit from it. Last year, PM Modi led a Yoga Day event at the UN headquarters, setting a Guinness World Record for the most nationalities — 135 — at a yoga lesson. The event featured notable figures like actor Richard Gere, singer-actor Mary Millben, New York Mayor Eric Adams, and various UN dignitaries. This year, PM Modi is leading the Yoga Day event in Srinagar. In recent years, yoga has gained worldwide acceptance as a necessary practice for achieving balance in a cluttered, chaotic world. PM Modi’s efforts in making yoga a crucial part of India’s cultural legacy and pride deserve applause. The writer is a national spokesperson of BJP, besides being a well-known author.

    "article_content": "Written By : Sayantani De News18.com Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 11:39 IST New Delhi, India A regular yoga routine promotes relaxation and mental clarity, enabling leaders to navigate high-pressure situations with greater ease and composure. (Getty Images) Businesses today are racing against time, and professionals are no strangers to tension and stress, especially in high-stakes environments that demand constant alertness, rapid decision-making, and steady focus. Besides, heavy workloads, long commutes, little autonomy and long work hours can cause chronic stress, making it difficult to separate emotions from work. According to Gallup’s State of the Global Workplace 2024 Report, 41 per cent of employees across the globe are experiencing rising stress, which is causing a rapid increase in incivility at work. In India, 32 per cent of employees are feeling stressed while 35 per cent of them are angry as compared to the global average of 21 per cent. Interestingly, not only employees but leaders as well are highly susceptible to stress, as they ensure business continuity and workplace safety while managing their emotions as well as their teams. In the face of these mounting challenges, yoga emerges as a powerful tool for stress management, offering tangible benefits that extend to individual well-being and team dynamics. Understanding and managing stress is crucial for effective leadership and professional success since chronic stress affects not only mental clarity but also physical health, leading to a drop in productivity. Coupled with meditation, yoga provides a framework that is holistic and hence, an effective solution. The benefits of yoga for stress reduction are well-documented. Practices such as deep breathing (pranayama) , physical postures (asanas) , and meditation, can help regulate the body’s stress response. Research shows that regular yoga practice leads to increased activation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) which may counteract detrimental effects of stress on the brain. It also impacts the activity of the amygdala, a part of the brain involved in processing emotions. Yoga may also increase the volume of the hippocampus, another part that regulates memory and learning but decreases in size with age. It also positively affects brain networks that may interfere with cognitive function and increase resilience and adaptability. A regular yoga routine promotes relaxation and mental clarity, enabling leaders to navigate high-pressure situations with greater ease and composure. Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, credits meditation and mindfulness, which are integral to yoga, for his ability to maintain focus and manage stress acquired from a previous workplace. Similarly, companies like General Mills and Target have incorporated yoga, meditation and mindfulness practices into their routines for more than a decade now. Companies that have embraced these policies and integrated yoga into their wellness programs have seen substantial benefits. Aetna, a US insurance giant, introduced mindfulness and yoga programs for its employees, resulting in a significant reduction in healthcare costs and an increase in productivity. Employees reported lower stress levels, better sleep, and a higher overall sense of well-being, translating into tangible business benefits. Lowering stress levels through yoga not only benefits individuals but also strengthens team dynamics. Stress often hampers communication and collaboration, critical components of effective teamwork. By reducing stress, yoga practices foster emotional intelligence, enhance empathy and understanding among team members and help create a more harmonious and productive team environment. Group yoga sessions, in particular, can serve as team-building activities, promoting a sense of unity and mutual support. This enhanced emotional connectivity leads to better cooperation and more resilient teams. A study conducted by Awaris and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) demonstrated that mindfulness fosters collective intelligence. 31 teams that participated in a ten-week mindfulness program showed an average increase of 13 per cent in collective intelligence, validating the significant impact of mindfulness on emotional intelligence, an essential component for increasing collective intelligence. Tapping into this collective intelligence creates an enormous opportunity for companies to build resilient teams who can find solutions to complex problems. Resilient teams can adapt to changes, overcome setbacks, and thrive in the face of adversity. Yoga contributes to building this resilience by fostering mindfulness and promoting a calm and focused mindset. The mental discipline fostered by yoga encourages a mindset of acceptance and adaptability, essential qualities for navigating uncertainty, and enables individuals to stay composed under pressure and unexpected challenges. Recognising the health benefits of yoga, the government has implemented policies to promote its practice in workplaces. The concept of yoga breaks, also known as Y-Breaks, is a case in point. The Y-Break App, aimed at working professionals, was introduced by the Ministry of AYUSH in 2021. The app is a five-minute yoga protocol comprising asanas, pranayama , and dhyana for office goers to help them de-stress, refresh and refocus at their workplace and increase their productivity. Last year, the Haryana government made yoga breaks mandatory in government and private universities, colleges, and offices. The Ministry of AYUSH actively promotes yoga through various initiatives, offering resources and support to organisations that wish to implement yoga programs. Such government backing not only encourages a healthier workforce but also presents a cost-effective way for companies to reduce healthcare expenses and improve employee morale. Incorporating yoga into the daily routine of leaders and teams offers numerous benefits, from stress reduction and enhanced team dynamics to increased resilience. Companies that adopt yoga-related wellness programs can foster healthier, more productive work environments. As the business landscape continues to evolve, the integration of holistic practices like yoga will be increasingly vital for sustaining high performance and navigating unforeseen challenges. By embracing yoga, leaders can not only manage their stress more effectively but also build stronger, more resilient teams poised to thrive in any situation.

(PTI file photo) As the Modi 3.0 government commences work in earnest following its historic mandate for a third consecutive term, and as Bharat moves closer to the centenary of its independence in 2047, the vision of Viksit Bharat—a developed India—remains centre stage and non-negotiable in its policy objectives. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision for ‘Viksit Bharat 2047’, while rooted in economic prosperity, also emphasises social equity, inclusive growth, and environmental sustainability, ensuring equitable and sustainable development. As such, this goal is non-negotiable and vital, and PM Modi’s third term will make it a reality. This goal is not just aspirational but a necessity for India’s future for several reasons- Over the past decade, Prime Minister Modi’s government has laid a solid foundation for Viksit Bharat through various reforms and initiatives. These efforts have already set India on a transformative path- Infrastructure Development: Projects like Bharatmala Pariyojana, the Sagarmala Programme, and the Smart Cities Mission have significantly improved connectivity and urban infrastructure. Digital Transformation: The Digital India initiative has revolutionised governance and service delivery, making public services more accessible and transparent. Economic Reforms: Implementing the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), and ease of doing business reforms have enhanced economic efficiency and attracted foreign investment. Social Welfare: Programs like Ayushman Bharat, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan have improved healthcare, housing, and sanitation, uplifting millions of lives. Prime Minister Modi’s third term will focus on several key initiatives to drive India towards the goal of Viksit Bharat- Continuity in leadership is crucial for the sustained implementation of long-term policies and projects. Prime Minister Modi’s third term will ensure policy stability, accelerate impetus for critical development projects, and prevent disruptions and policy paralysis. Building on the momentum of the past decade, PM Modi’s leadership will drive further advancements in infrastructure, digitalisation, and economic reforms and help guide the nation through complex challenges, leveraging his experience and strategic insight. The pro-incumbency wave and public support for PM Modi’s leadership reflect confidence in his development agenda and have provided a stable mandate for his third term, along with the expansion of the BJP’s and NDA’s footprint in the new states of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, and a comfortable win again in Arunachal Pradesh. This, combined with the BJP’s organisational strength and extensive grassroots network, ensures the effective implementation of policies at all levels. Elections will come and go in the hurly-burly of our great democracy, and their related analysis and scrutiny will continue as we head towards 2047, but the vision and goal of Viksit Bharat must be safeguarded and should be the key objective of all new governments. The Opposition must also align with this imperative and ensure that the journey to a developed Bharat is neither stonewalled nor thwarted. It is the duty of the Opposition to question and challenge the government of the day, but it also has a responsibility to emphatically support higher national objectives. Viksit Bharat 2047 is not just a vision but a comprehensive roadmap for transforming India into a developed nation. It is a non-negotiable goal for India’s future, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s third term is pivotal in realising this vision. With a strong foundation already in place, the continued leadership of PM Modi will ensure policy stability, strategic alignment, and effective implementation. As India stands on the brink of a transformative journey, PM Modi’s third term promises to be a decisive phase in achieving the dream of a developed and prosperous nation by 2047.

    "article_content": "Written By : Biswadeep Ghosh News18.com Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 16:21 IST New Delhi, India Crew, a recent release, has a remake of the 1993 film Khalnayak’s famous song ‘Choli Ke Peeche.’ The original song was composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal. Many modern-day youngsters may not have seen an audio cassette, either of the pre-recorded or blank variety. In the 1980s, when audio cassettes were an inevitable presence on every music lover’s shelf, India also witnessed a dramatic increase in the popularity of remakes of popular songs from old films. The legendary composer Rahul Dev Burman’s songs, in particular, were popular with those who sought to create these versions, which did not feature in films and were easily available in pirated cassettes. The recording quality was frequently substandard, and one wondered whether composers of original songs were aware of the number of remakes of their songs, which were circulated freely across the country. Copyright robbery was common, in other words, and nobody could do anything about it. Reworked versions of old songs have been common in Hindi films, too. Of course, filmmaking takes place in an organized environment. So, the new versions are created after acquiring the necessary permissions. Still, why old songs need to be turned into remakes, even if the person who creates these new versions might incorporate a few lines from the original track, has been questioned. What leads to such criticisms is the argument that new films should have new songs. Besides, a remake, even if it incorporates a few short parts of the original song, seems to be a convenient way of capitalizing on the latter’s popularity. Crew , a recent release, has a remake of the 1993 film Khalnayak ’s famous song ‘ Choli Ke Peeche. ’ The original song was composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal, while Akshay-IP is the duo behind the new version. Govinda fans will remember ‘ Sona Kitna Sona Hai ’ from Hero No.1 (1997) composed by Anand-Milind. Crew has its remake also recreated by Akshay-IP. Moreover, the film has a remake of Ila Arun’s Rajasthani folk song ‘ Delhi Shahar Mein Maro Ghagro Jo Ghumyo ’ by Bharg-Rohit titled ‘ Ghagra ’. Although Crew is a well-liked entertainer, the extent to which the film depends on old songs is astonishing. Bollywood has produced countless remakes of films over the years. This has been criticized, and many recent Hindi remakes have flopped because of the modern-day viewer’s access to their original versions on OTT platforms. The business of film music is different. Those who create reworked versions know that the film music lover, who might have also heard the original songs, is likely to accept their modernized interpretations wholeheartedly. That happens often, too, although critics and a section of music lovers who want old songs to be left alone resent such experiments. Music composer Pritam is the common factor in ‘ Character Dheela Hai ’ from Ready (2011) and ‘ Character Dheela 2.0 ’ for Shehzada (2023) recreated by Abhijit Vaghani and Pritam. Tanishk Bagchi went to the extent of recreating the classic ‘ Ek Chatur Naar Karke Singar ’ from Padosan (1961). The new version, ‘Chatur Naar ’, was featured in Machine (2017). The Padosan song composed by RD Burman is a unique instance of spontaneity in performance. The jugalbandi of maestros Kishore Kumar and Manna Dey, with a little help from Mahmood, is unforgettable. Bagchi’s version was a disaster, which was not a surprise. Machine had another song of the same kind: ‘ Cheez Badi ’, a remake of ‘ Tu Cheez Badi Hoon Mast Mast ’ from Mohra (1994). When an old number in a new form is used for an item number, it can magic. In Total Dhamaal (2019) , Sonakshi Sinha’s dance moves with ‘ Mungda ’ recreated by Gourov-Roshin became a big hit. The original song from ‘ Inkaar ’ (1977), a Rajesh Roshan composition, featured Bollywood’s original dancing queen Helen, and its readymade popularity contributed to the success of the new version. ‘ Laila Ho Laila ’ from Qurbani (1980) composed by Kalyanji-Anandji in which Zeenat Aman sizzled on the screen was reborn as ‘ Laila Main Laila ’ in Raees (2019) in which Sunny Leone’s dance steps fit the bill perfectly. Ram Sampath’s contribution to the remake was minimal, a good thing considering the popularity of the original track. Several Bollywood films have taken their titles from hit songs. The 2019 film Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga ’s title is also a popular song of the same name from the film 1942: A Love Story (1994) composed by RD Burman. The new film’s title track ‘ Ek Ladki Ko Dekha To Aisa Laga ’ is Rochak Kohli’s recreated version of the same RD Burman song. Interestingly, while Sonam Kapoor stars in ELKDTAL , her father Anil Kapoor is the male lead in the 1994 film. ‘ Raabta ’, a song from Agent Vinod (2012), is also the title of a 2017 film. The latter’s title track is a song of the same name from Agent Vinod , and both versions have been composed by Pritam. Both these new versions have been uniformly appreciated, which is a rare response. The problem with the remake of an old song is that it is unable to eclipse the latter’s memories. It might become popular for a while, but it is impossible to overlook the original track’s contribution to its success. However, Bollywood will continue to produce song remakes because filmmakers know that most viewers enjoy them as part of new films when they are screened at the theatres. For some makers of commercial cinema, that is what ultimately matters. The writer, a journalist for three decades, writes on literature and pop culture.

    "article_content": "Written By : Rahul Shivshankar CNN-News18 Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 19:30 IST New Delhi, India In hindsight, the 'composite culture' narrative insulated generations of Indians from facts that have deeply affected their ability to make informed ideological choices. (Representational pic/PTI) The NCERT, the central authority in charge of designing the syllabus for academic study in educational institutions has carried out another round of deletions and alterations. This time it has focussed its attention on Class 12 political science textbooks. The so-called course correction, pun very much intended, will mean that Class 12 students will no longer learn about certain seminal events that shaped the Hindutva movement. For instance, Class 12 textbooks will no longer allude to the BJP’s ‘Rath Yatra’ from Somnath to Ayodhya or even the saffron party’s expression of regret over the “Ayodhya happenings”. Indeed, references to the Babri demolition (the mosque itself is going to be referred to only as the “three-domed structure”) have been edited out. This is also true of the mention of “Muslims massacred in Gujarat riots” and “achievements” of Mughal emperors. The NCERT’s director has been quoted as having said that the deletions were necessary because he was particularly against teaching about riots in textbooks. The reason is that the NCERT wants “to create positive citizens, not violent and depressed individuals”. Of course, apart from the director’s reasons, the NCERT has adduced quite a few in its press statement before helpfully pointing out that these changes have been cleared by “pedagogy experts”. Expectedly, the decision to gloss over these events in the textbook, some extremely consequential, has spawned a backlash among sections of the intelligentsia and the opposition. Those opposed to the changes accuse the premier education panel of sanitising society and polity. In their opinion, the NCERT is “infantilising the learner”. One newspaper editorial for instance observed that the NCERT director’s comments reveal “an overwhelming anxiety to present a picture of a sanitised society and polity by papering over fault lines and events that are constitutive of a nation’s journey, and even its learning arc”. While there can be no quibble with this argument, we cannot allow ourselves to be selective about when we bring ourselves to interrogate the paternalism of the Indian state. If the Left objects to the sanitised history of the “three-domed structure”, then it should be as worked up about the paternal state’s erstwhile omissions. Why haven’t we ever been taught about the oppressive psychological and material impact Muslim colonialism and latter-day separatism had and has on Hindus? How we come to terms with our past will determine how we shape our present and future. Despite the logical infallibility of this cliché, those who shaped our textbooks in the early years of the republic saw our past through an ideologically jaundiced lens. Dr BR Ambedkar, the framer of our Constitution, was a strident critic of the organised effort of the intellectual class when it came to papering over the Hindu-Muslim fault line that palpably ran through the polity. At the time this secularisation of India’s history was deemed important in the “interests of national unity” and that “the needs of a modernising society should be the primary considerations in our choice and presentation of material”. Had this not been recorded for posterity in the shape of a recommendation made by the Committee on School Textbooks of the Government of India in 1969, this sleight of history would have been denied. In hindsight, the “composite culture” narrative insulated generations of Indians from facts that have deeply affected their ability to make informed ideological choices. Especially, when it came to exercising their right to vote. Would for instance those who today lament the NCERT’s alleged “course correction” stand up for a genuine rewrite of India’s textbook history incorporating some of the more painful aspects of Islamic settler colonisation? One seriously doubts it. If anything, these Left activists will dismiss such an endeavour as an example of “saffronising” education with the aim of “weaponising history” to punish today’s Muslims for crimes committed by their forefathers. Like it or not, the NCERT under the NDA has tactically borrowed from the ideological left – the so-called Macaulayputras – to win the battle of narratives. One hopes though that in the process the intellectual Right will guard against an overcorrection. Because if it fails to stay within the redlines, it will, much like the Left, end up contributing to Bharat losing the war it is fighting to accurately record its history."

    "article_content": "Written By : Leena Menghaney News18.com Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 19:33 IST New Delhi, India Mascarenhas addresses the question of Dr Swaminathan's decision to leave her position at the Department of Health Research and ICMR to join WHO. Anuradha Mascarenhas’ debut book, At the Wheel of Research (Bloomsbury, Rs 599), sheds light on the life and times of Dr Soumya Swaminathan, India’s foremost clinician-researcher. Dr Swaminathan’s pivotal role in shaping India’s response to HIV and TB research, and her appointment as the first chief scientist at the World Health Organization (WHO) just before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic that at its peak claimed a life every three minutes, forms the crux of the narrative. One of the biography’s strengths lies in its exploration of Dr Swaminathan’s profound impact on shaping India’s response to HIV and TB. A few years into my work on HIV, there was a growing realisation that tackling TB was key to saving lives, and as MSF’s (Medecins Sans Frontieres’) representative of the Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines, I met the soft-spoken scientist at an HIV conference in Chennai. Dr Soumya’s tenure at NIRT treating patients and at the same time building evidence with her team for molecular tests, shorter regimens, preventive therapy and more child-friendly tools resonate with MSF’s own journey as a treatment provider to find better tests and regimens for DR-TB for its patients in India. Her team’s research efforts at ICMR’s NIRT shaped MSF and the TB community’s public health advocacy and action on access to innovative diagnostics and lifesaving treatments for TB and DR-TB for adults and children in India and in other high-burden settings. Mascarenhas delves into Dr Swaminathan’s enduring legacy for research in India and highlights her instrumental role in convincing policymakers to establish the TB Research Consortium under her leadership at ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research). Her relationships with her patients, Bunty with leukaemia, and Noorie, the trans-woman activist living with HIV in Chennai, offer invaluable insights into her clinical work. Her leadership in shunning discriminatory practices rampant in the early days of the AIDS epidemic among clinicians and treating people living with HIV at a time when there were no antiretrovirals available, paved the way for her contemporaries to follow suit. Mascarenhas navigates through Swaminathan’s commitment to TB survivors and TB-affected populations, emphasising her advocacy for their inclusion in policy-making at the WHO and other high-level meetings. Mascarenhas addresses the question of Dr Swaminathan’s decision to leave her position at the Department of Health Research and ICMR to join WHO. At the time in 2017, she was at the forefront of driving research and policy decisions to improve public health programmes, the detection and treatment of diseases such as DR-TB, the introduction of the HPV vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, and India’s fledging response to non-communicable diseases. We finally had a clinician who understood that research was important to drive access to better tools for the most vulnerable, building collaborations with institutions across the world for patient-centred care was critical, and inclusion of affected communities is key to driving research in the right direction, and convince policymakers and ministers to support these initiatives at ICMR. Her departure from such a leadership position in medical research was a setback for people and public health in India. In the end, the book highlights that the decision proved to be key to shaping WHO’s scientific response to the public health emergency, in partnership with Dr Tedros the first Director General from Africa provided leadership amidst the pandemic. The WHO needed to step up to address the need for prevention measures, diagnostics, medicines and vaccines and ensure equitable access to these tools. As the chief scientist at WHO, she helped shape the R&D roadmap, led a global forum for Covid-19 research, supported the Solidarity clinical trial for Covid treatments and highlighted the inequalities in accessing Covid-19 vaccines between high-income and low-middle-income countries. Her scientific credentials strengthened WHO’s response in tackling dangerous mis/disinformation in Covid-19 and as a spokesperson for the WHO, she brought evidence-based information to millions of people across the world. The biography offers insight into the WHO and global diplomacy around Covid-19 and the challenges the institution faces amidst the pandemic. The biography concludes by highlighting Swaminathan’s return to India as the head of the Swaminathan Foundation, where she continues to champion interdisciplinary research at the intersection of agriculture, climate change, and health. This new chapter in her career underscores her enduring dedication to advancing scientific innovation and addressing pressing global challenges. Overall, Mascarenhas’ biography is a valuable read for anyone interested in the intersection of medicine, research, and equity.

    "article_content": "Written By : Arun Anand News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 14:23 IST New Delhi, India In Tibet's perception, China has been viewed as a hostile power, consistently posing threats whenever possible. (Image: Reuters) The Canadian House of Commons recently passed a unanimous bill supporting Tibet’s right to self-determination . The US Congress also approved a similar bill, known as the Resolve Tibet Act, awaiting President Joe Biden’s signature . This legislation from the US Congress also addresses China’s misinformation campaigns targeting Tibet. The issue of Tibet has long been sidelined in international affairs. When China first invaded and labelled it as ‘liberating Tibet’, global attention was diverted by the more pressing Korean War. Since then, China has gained power over the past sixty years and has used it to suppress criticism at home and abroad. In light of these recent developments, it is crucial to revisit the debate on Tibet’s national sovereignty, a topic China has long evaded. Throughout its extensive history, Tibet has indeed encountered various levels of foreign influence from entities like the Mongols, the Gorkhas of Nepal, the Manchu emperors of China, and the British in India. Historically, Tibet wielded influence over its neighbours, including China. Few nations today have escaped foreign influence or dominance entirely. The extent and duration of foreign interference in Tibet’s affairs have been relatively limited. Additionally, relations with the Mongols, Chinese, and Manchu rulers, where they held political significance, remained largely personal and never implied a fusion or integration of the Chinese and Tibetan states. In ancient times, Tibetan culture notably displayed stronger cultural ties with India, the birthplace of Buddhism. Tibet stands at a unique crossroads of Buddhism and Shaivism, profoundly shaping its culture and politics in subsequent centuries . In contrast, China has been rooted in a Confucian civilisation where Buddhism, transmitted via Tibet much like in Mongolia , evolved differently from Tibetan Buddhism . Tibetan emperors did engage in marital ties with China, as they did with Nepal. However, Nepal never asserted a claim of ‘ownership’ over Tibet, unlike China. Throughout much of its history, Tibet existed as an independent nation. Until 1950, Tibet functioned autonomously with defined territory and governance over its population, managing its own foreign relations. Historical parallels can be drawn, such as Poland’s removal from world maps by the German and Russian empires, yet regaining independence and territory post-World War II due to the strong national identity of the Polish people. Similarly, Tibet possesses a distinct identity among nations, notably differing culturally from mainland China. This distinction is evident in the Tibetan language, which markedly differs from Chinese, including its unique script. Similarly, Tibetan food practices are distinctly unique. A notable difference between Tibetan and China’s governance lies in Tibet’s long-standing theocratic system contrasted with China’s bureaucratic control under the Mandarins . Scholars like Benedict Anderson, known for his concept of ‘ Imagined Community ,’ find relevance here, as do others such as Anthony Smith with ‘ Ethno-Symbolism .’ These frameworks aptly illustrate Tibet’s identification with distinct symbols, values, myths, and memories, separate from those of China. In Tibet’s perception, China has been viewed as a hostile power, consistently posing threats whenever possible. Tibetans aspire to live peacefully and seek autonomy to uphold their beliefs, yet China denies them even this basic right. In 1950, China invaded Tibet and coerced the signing of the 17-Point Agreement , which promised internal autonomy and freedom for Tibetans. However, the 1959 Tibetan uprising revealed that China failed to honour its commitments under this agreement. It’s crucial to understand that Communist China’s concept of nationhood diverges significantly from that of imperial China. It seeks to homogenise all ethnic groups within its borders under a singular Han-dominated national identity, requiring them to forsake their original cultures and identities. This parallels the former Soviet Union’s attempt to create the “New Soviet Man” detached from ethnic and cultural ties—a strategy that ultimately led to the dissolution of the USSR into 15 independent states . While China has suppressed dissent and sought assimilation, it has not achieved complete success, akin to the USSR’s historical experience. China has attempted to address the Tibet issue by leveraging its global influence and economic power. The Western world was content with China as long as it did not pose a geopolitical challenge. Now, however, major countries worldwide are increasingly becoming mindful of China’s actions concerning minority nations. The recent motions in Canada and the US Congress signify a crucial shift in international attitudes – a corrective step by the global community that had previously overlooked Tibet.

    "article_content": "Written By : Akhileshwar Sahay News18.com Last Updated: June 22, 2024, 17:24 IST New Delhi, India Amid a sweltering heatwave, Delhi is also in the unprecedented grip of chaos, confusion, and extraordinary hardship, perpetrated on the common person due to never-ending water woes. (Image: PTI) Delhi, the national capital, has experienced a summer unlike any other. The city sweltered through a prolonged period of record high temperatures, driven by a brutal heatwave fuelled by global warming. This relentless heat brought Delhi to its knees. Recent reports indicate that the sweltering heatwave has already led to nearly two dozen deaths in the capital this summer. The situation is likely to worsen, with the World Meteorological Organisation reporting that “Asia is heating up faster than the global average, with increased casualties and economic losses from floods, storms, and more severe heatwaves”. Amid a sweltering heatwave, Delhi is also in the unprecedented grip of chaos, confusion, and extraordinary hardship, perpetrated on the common person due to the forceful return of the city’s familiar foe: never-ending water woes. What began as a crisis in informal slum settlements has since spread its tentacles to Lutyens’ Delhi, the President’s Estate, Parliament, the Prime Minister’s house, numerous posh colonies and markets. The Delhi Jal Board (DJB) is struggling to even supply potable water to major hospitals like AIIMS, Safdarjung, RML, and Lady Hardinge. This article traces the origin of Delhi’s water woes, dissecting why it has assumed monstrous proportions before examining sustainable ways to alleviate the fast-worsening situation. But before I proceed further, it is time to take note of the recent observations made by a vacation bench of Justices P.K. Mishra and P.B. Varale of the Supreme Court of India. Their Lordships identified the tanker mafia and water spillage as the primary culprits behind Delhi’s chronic water shortage. The Court issued a stern warning to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government, urging them to rein in the mafia. Should the government fail, the Supreme Court cautioned that it would unleash the Union government-controlled Delhi police on the water mafia and those responsible for water wastage. It is as bad as it can get. Causes, consequences, and remedial measures to ease the never-ending, multi-dimensional problem of Delhi’s water woes are the core topics of this piece. But the above-mentioned admonishment by the Supreme Court takes this member of the commentariat down memory lane to the authoritative book on corruption in India, The Pathology of Corruption (1998), by the distinguished bureaucrat and author S. S. Gill. Below are, from my memory, two paragraphs of the book. Gill wrote on the back cover of the book: “Nehru cleanest to the mole, legitimatised corruption by extreme tolerance of corruption among his ministers, Indira Gandhi institutionalised it in the process of building her war-chest, Rajeev Gandhi himself faced corruption charges and Narasimha Rao is facing corruption charges in three cases. I only hope that the next full-time Prime Minister does not rule the country from the Tihar Jail.” The last sentence sent shivers down my spine when I first read the book in the year 2000. But no longer, with Delhi being ruled by its Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal from the precincts of Tihar Jail. The second paragraph in the book bespoke the naked truth. Gill wrote somewhere in the book the following: “When it comes to corruption, Delhi Electricity Board has some competition in the country, but the corruption in Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has no peer or parallel in the nation.” The Supreme Court of India in its recent observation has placed this corruption of DJB and the water tanker mafia at the centre of Delhi’s water woes. Atishi Marlena, Delhi’s water minister, has blamed Haryana for the crisis and commenced an indefinite hunger strike, “paani satyagraha,” from June 21, demanding more water from the neighbouring state. The causes and consequences of Delhi’s water crisis are dire, posing significant threats to human life. The search for remedial measures to solve this perennial, persistent, and worsening situation is fraught with challenges and remains elusive. The blatant corruption within the DJB thwarts all attempts at a solution. Nonetheless, let’s begin with a root cause analysis of the water crisis in Bharat before focusing specifically on Delhi. Planet Earth is becoming increasingly parched. Only 2.5 per cent of the Earth’s water is freshwater, and the actual amount available for use is significantly smaller. The situation is far worse in Bharat. While a detailed examination of the country’s worsening water crisis warrants a separate discussion, it’s important to note that with 2 per cent of the world’s landmass and 4 per cent of its freshwater, Bharat is home to 18 per cent of the global population. Consequently, 600 million Indians face high to extreme water stress. According to the 2020 Yale University unsafe water index, the country ranks a lowly 140th out of 180 countries. But the above data is just the tip of the iceberg. The hard data indicates that Bharat’s average annual per capita water availability has plummeted from 3,000-4,000 cubic metres in 1950 to a mere 1,486 cubic metres in 2021. This figure is projected to further dwindle to 1,367 cubic metres by 2031. Groundwater is becoming both scarce and contaminated, with Bharat being the largest groundwater extractor in the world. Surface water is increasingly getting polluted. The World Bank’s latest figures are even more alarming: India’s current per capita water availability stands at a meagre 1,100 cubic metres. This alarming figure falls “well below the internationally recognised threshold of water stress of 1,700 m3 per person and is dangerously close to the water scarcity threshold of 1,000 m3 per person”. In stark contrast, the global per capita water availability remains at a comparatively abundant 5,500 cubic metres. Bharat has surpassed China as the world’s most populous nation and is experiencing rapid urbanisation. However, this growth is occurring against a backdrop of increasing water scarcity and contamination. An alarming 70 per cent of Bharat’s surface water is unfit for consumption. Every day, approximately 40 million litres of untreated wastewater flow directly into the country’s rivers, compounding the crisis. This toxic mix of polluted surface water and contaminated groundwater has emerged as a silent killer, disproportionately impacting India’s poorest citizens. The causes of Delhi’s severe water crisis are legion. Here are the more important ones. One, the ticking population bomb: Delhi’s population is growing faster than that of any other city in the world. Already the world’s second most populous city, Delhi’s population is expected to reach 37.2 million by 2025 and 43.4 million by 2030. According to the United Nations, by 2028, Delhi will surpass Tokyo as the most populous city. With the population bomb ticking rapidly amidst fast economic development, the per capita availability of potable water is shrinking much faster than desired. Two, polluted Yamuna water: It is ironic that the soon-to-be most populous city has no water of its own despite being located on the bank of the perennial river Yamuna. The Yamuna water is polluted beyond redemption and is unfit even for animal consumption. High ammonia levels (more than 2.5 parts per million) in the Yamuna have long contributed to poor water supply in parts of Delhi. An increase in ammonia levels often leads to a 50 per cent decrease in production at the Wazirabad and Chandrawal water treatment plants. Three , depleting groundwater: A recent Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) survey reveals alarming groundwater depletion across Delhi. The study indicates an annual decline of 0.5 to 2 metres in most areas, with the situation reaching “critical” or “semi-critical” levels in the majority of the city, barring a few exceptions in the west and central regions. Furthermore, the CGWB’s ‘Dynamic Groundwater Resources of India 2023’ report, released on December 1, 2023, states that a staggering 41.49 per cent of Delhi’s total area (1,487.61 square kilometres) is now classified as “over-exploited” due to excessive groundwater extraction. Four , vanishing water bodies: Belonging to a semi-arid zone, the national capital witnesses low and uncertain annual rainfall. Compounding the travesty is the city’s water bodies doing a vanishing trick. As per a dated Delhi Parks and Gardens Society report (2014), over 200 water bodies – lakes, ponds, and moats – have vanished due to encroachment with the active connivance of governmental agencies including the DDA, MCD and DJB and turned into cremation grounds, temples, stadium and even a bus terminal. The Delhi government keeps talking from the rooftops about the rejuvenation of water bodies, but more and more water bodies are being lost to land mafias and developers. Five, dependence on outside water: With no water of its own, Delhi depends on the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in 1994 by the five basin states of the Yamuna—Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh—for sharing the water. Today, 90 per cent of Delhi’s drinking water demand is met by Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. With the heatwave gripping the whole of north India, the neighbouring states must prioritise their own water needs before meeting the ever-growing demand of Delhi. Six, shrinking per capita water availability: With the rising annual influx of migrants, increasing informal and moving settlements and an ever-increasing floating population, it is almost impossible to quantify the daily requirements of water in the national capital. Nonetheless, as per a dated Delhi government economic survey (2021-2022), the city needed 1,380 million gallons of water (5,223 million litres) every day in 2021, based on the norm of 60 gallons per capita per day (GPCD), while the water supply was around 998 MGD. The situation has worsened since then. It is estimated that Delhi currently faces a demand-supply gap of over 450-500 million gallons of water every day. A higher demand-supply gap means increasing reliance on groundwater, bottled water and water tankers and increasing menace of chaotic and corrupt water tanker mafia. Seven, poor water treatment capacity and supply network: As per the DJB data, out of Delhi’s total raw water, 40 per cent comes from Yamuna sourced from Haryana, 25 per cent from Ganga, 22 per cent from Bhakra Nangal Dam and the rest from subsurface water like tubewells. Delhi Jal Board has 5169 functional tubewells in various parts of the city a large number of which was perennially in disrepair. In addition, there are 11 functional Ranney Wells along the Yamuna River but more than 30 per cent of extracted groundwater is non-potable. The raw water received from different sources is treated at nine water treatment plants (WTP) in the city, which seldom work at their rated capacity. The treated water is then supplied through a network of more than 15,000 km of pipelines and groundwater tanks. However, much of this pipeline is dilapidated and in disrepair. Eight, massive water spillage: Indian cities grapple with chronic water distribution spillage. On average, unaccounted-for water (UFW) in urban areas across the country hovers around 25-30 per cent. However, Delhi’s UFW rate is unparalleled. According to recent data submitted to the Supreme Court by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, the Delhi Jal Board’s total distribution loss stands at a staggering 52 per cent. Even more concerning, a compilation of government data by this author is disconcerting “Delhi’s UFW has surged from 42 per cent in 2019-20 to a staggering 55 per cent in 2022-23”. Water losses plague every stage of Delhi’s water supply system—from treatment plants and conveyance systems to distribution networks—exacerbated by leaks and rampant theft. The blame for this unprecedented water loss lies squarely with the DJB and its complicity with the tanker mafia and industries. As always, those at the bottom of the pyramid bear the brunt of the crisis. This dire situation is rendered even more tragic by the Delhi government’s claims of providing free lifeline water (up to 20 kilolitres) to every household with a metered connection, a scheme they boast has benefitted approximately 24.72 lakh consumers since its inception. Ironically, this very free water scheme, translating to 130 litres per capita, has emerged as a key contributor to Delhi’s water woes. Nine, rich and poor divide: The poor and downtrodden, those at the bottom of the pyramid, are the worst sufferers of Delhi’s water crisis. Unable to afford the expensive water tankers—a resource disproportionately available to the rich—they struggle to secure even a bucket of unsafe water, in a city whose government claims to provide 172 litres of water per capita to citizens and 130 litres per capita free to the poor. The consequences are dire: a surge in waterborne diseases like cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, and typhoid, leading to increased suffering and fatalities. Ten, pathologically corrupt DJB: Last but not least, the entire body fabric of Delhi Jal Board has turned pathologically corrupt. As S.S. Gill aptly articulated in his book, The Pathology of Corruption , the depth of corruption within the DJB is unparalleled. This entrenched corruption lies at the very heart of Delhi’s worsening water crisis. To sum up, Delhi’s water crisis is a permanent problem which needs permanent solutions. No patchwork, no indefinite hunger strike, and no begging bowl to neighbouring states will provide solace. The city, with its unprecedented urban sprawl, is staring at Day Zero. The time for long-term, sustainable solutions is now. The stark reality is this: without water at the source, there can be no water in the tap. It’s time to move beyond short-sighted, band-aid solutions. Delhi needs a paradigm shift—a long-term vision for water security. This demands a comprehensive 20-year water and sanitation plan, strategically divided into manageable five-year, one-year, and even monthly targets. This plan must be a collective endeavour, engaging every citizen of Delhi. We must acknowledge the unsustainable nature of demanding 172 litres of water per capita, let alone 130 litres free of charge. Moreover, Delhi cannot survive with a staggering 50 per cent leakage rate. Delhi, thy time for decisive action begins now. Tomorrow will be too late.

    "article_content": "Written By : Utpal Kumar News18.com Last Updated: June 22, 2024, 18:47 IST New Delhi, India The BJP should own up the Lok Sabha results with cautious optimism, for rarely does a party retain power for three consecutive terms. (File pic/PTI) The 2024 Lok Sabha election results have positives for everyone. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), though disappointed at its tally sliding from 303 seats in 2019 to 240 this time, is relieved to be in power for three consecutive terms — a feat that was last repeated over six decades ago. The Congress-led Opposition’s 2024 numbers may be lesser than the BJP’s total tally, but it is happy at detecting a chink in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s armour — or so it seems to believe. The Congress, under Rahul Gandhi, may have delivered its third-worst Lok Sabha performance after being confined to two digits for three general elections in a row, but it is rallying around its supporters with a sense of achievement at keeping the BJP below the 272 mark. The same is the case with their respective supporters: While the Hindu voters of the BJP are elated with their party coming back to power again, the Muslim voters have reasons to believe they have regained their ‘veto power’ in Indian politics. The Congress-led Opposition may be euphoric with the results, but it is the BJP that should be relieved. It has, after all, realised all is not well within the party without losing the levers of power in Raisina Hill. The party has now got five years to put its house in order. But the problem for the BJP is that, in an election where everyone has a thing or two to be happy about, it is easy to misinterpret the verdict. To begin with, the BJP should own up the Lok Sabha results with cautious optimism, for rarely does a party retain power for three consecutive terms. The Modi government hasn’t just been able to beat anti-incumbency; it has also defied a post-pandemic trend of Covid-19 being a graveyard for ruling dispensations worldwide. Hardly any incumbents have made a comeback after the unprecedented coronavirus attack. The danger for the BJP, however, isn’t just about not resorting to any corrective measures but, more importantly, taking to a wrong prescription. The latter, unfortunately, is a more likely scenario, given the egoistical tendency among politicians to blame voters rather than the party leadership for the recent electoral reverses. One has seen how the voters of Uttar Pradesh, especially Ayodhya, have been villainised post poll results. Political analysts with dubious intentions are already out with their verdict, highlighting the diminishing returns of Hindutva in Indian politics! The BJP would do well not to fall for such part feel-good, part-dubious analysis. The party may also be tempted to look at the results as a localised, one-off phenomenon. Localised, because if the party lost almost 50 per cent of seats in Uttar Pradesh, it did a complete sweep in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. The truth is that Uttar Pradesh could upset the BJP’s applecart because it, unlike Madhya Pradesh, has a semblance of opposition with a solid M-Y vote-bank going for anyone and everyone capable enough to defeat the BJP. Wherever the Opposition had a party infrastructure, even if rudimentary, and some vote-banks to cater to, whether in Uttar Pradesh or in Maharashtra, it did trouble the BJP. And then, of course, one saw a smart ticket distribution by the Opposition, especially in Uttar Pradesh where Akhilesh Yadav, to his credit, liberally gave SP tickets to Dalits and OBCs: less than 10 seats were given to M-Y candidates! In contrast, the BJP had issues with ticket distribution. Many candidates were seen to be misfits, incompetent and corrupt; several others were direct imports from other parties. This caused a lot of dissent, angst and heartburn within the party. The BJP candidate from Ayodhya, for instance, was hugely unpopular, and it was evident well before the polling that he was on sticky ground. Of course, he made things even more difficult for himself and the party through his loose talks on reservations and the Constitution. What further added to the BJP’s woes was the perceived ideological fluidity in the party. When a party, which gets 18-20 per cent votes just for being regarded as a vehicle of Hindutva politics, is perceived to distance itself from “bhagwa” , as its national president publicly did just during the election campaign, it is bound to boomerang on the party. JP Nadda, in an interview with a Delhi-based newspaper, said that the “BJP and bhagwa (saffron) are not synonymous”, and that the BJP didn’t need the RSS to win the 2024 elections! What he forgot was that when a Hindu doesn’t look at himself as a Hindu, then there are enough temptations for him to take on caste identities. The BJP must realise that any compromise in its ideological positioning has invariably resulted in a political hara-kiri for the party. It happened in 1984, when the BJP, fresh out of the Jana Sangh, burnt its fingers by overtly associating itself with Gandhian socialism; it could win just two seats in the Lok Sabha. A similar fate awaited the party in 2004 and 2009 when the Jinnah-fied BJP softened its Hindutva identity. The problem for the BJP is that the moment it is seen to be ‘secularised’, its core voters either get disillusioned and disinterested, or they switch their loyalties to caste-based parties. The BJP, unlike other parties, including the Congress, can never afford to go soft on the ideological front. It has to live with the fact that it is judged more stringently on the issue of ideology and corruption. Maybe that’s the price of being an ideology-oriented, cadre-based party — “a party with a difference”! There’s one more reason for local BJP leaders and workers turning either lax or indifferent this time: they find their bhagidari both in party and administration diminishing. A number of local leaders told this author personally how they no longer are able to get the work of people of their constituency done. As one BJP leader in Bihar said, “Earlier, whenever I used to call a district administrator regarding a local work, it was done. Ab koi sunwayi nahin hai . In fact, now when someone comes up to me for work, I categorically tell them that I would call the concerned officer but there is no guarantee that it will be done.” The Modi government will have to find a middle path between political interference and bureaucratic highhandedness. It’s an absolute compulsion for a cadre-based party like the BJP to be alive to the sentiments of its local leaders and workers. If a party worker in Ayodhya commits suicide over an alleged land encroachment issue and the party is seen to be doing pretty little about it, then it paralyses the whole system at the grassroots. When a resourceful, local BJP leader in Lucknow is unable to find a bed for his ailing wife in a decent hospital and is forced to fend for himself for her treatment, then it raises an alarm bell within the party. In this backdrop, is it any surprise that the Opposition could go around duping the voters with its mindless promises and selling a nightmarish scenario vis-à-vis reservations to Dalits and OBCs, and yet the BJP leadership remained largely clueless about it? The party will have to revitalise its cadre base, and restart a two-way dialogue process. Given the long litany list above, one may be tempted to believe it’s all over for the BJP. The fact, however, is that the saffron party is still well ahead of its rivals and has a well-oiled poll machinery. The issues that have come up this time are normal for a party that has been in power for over a decade now. But the very fact that the BJP, despite the above challenges, has got more seats than any political party in more than three decades, is self-explanatory. The BJP, by ‘servicing’ its organisational structure, by providing a voice to its local leaders and workers, and also by sorting out critical differences, if any, between the state and central leaderships, besides ironing out ideological fluidity, can again become an invincible poll machine.

(Image: Reuters) The far-Right sweep in the recent election results shows that the European Union has started addressing the elephant in the room. The beast called radical Islam had entered meekly, in boats from devastated habitats, seeking asylum in liberal democracies and open societies. It has since gone on a rampage, seeking to recreate in its host country the very hell it had escaped. Whether it is the grooming gangs of Birmingham, the Charlie Hebdo massacre, the Nice beheading, Sweden riots over the Quran, the Mannheim knife attack, or the gang rape of a 12-year-old French girl in Courbevoie, Europe’s patience has been seriously tested over the decades. Israel’s war on Hamas after the October 7 massacre has given Islamists and communists the perfect excuse to manufacture anger and set European streets and American campuses on fire. All this while, ordinary, law-abiding citizens of the West watched spectacle after gruesome spectacle without speaking a word, their conscience chloroformed by political correctness. But now, voters in nation after nation are speaking out through the ballot. The ‘far-Right’ — a Leftist-liberal label for anybody speaking the inconvenient truth about Islamism — is ruling from Hungary to Italy, Poland to the Netherlands. It is on the rise in France, Germany, and the UK. But there is another, less evident movement afoot. Thanks to the reach of social media, people and their representatives from across the world are reaching out to one another and have started forming an informal coalition against radical Islam. So, you will find Indians and Indian politicians vocally supporting Israel against Hamas’s barbarism. Or Donald Trump supporters lending a voice to the outrage against the French girl’s gang rape. Interestingly, a very wealthy and influential section of the Islamic world — Arab states like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan, Oman, and even Egypt — has been silently part of the coalition against Islamist extremism. Arab nations have steadfastly refused to take Palestinian refugees, convinced that violent Hamas flotsam will come with it. And that will mean trouble. Most Arab states have unequivocally condemned the October 7 massacre, while making perfunctory noises about a two-state solution to the Palestinian problem. Saudi has banned extremist groups like Tablighi Jamaat which freely roam in its birthplace, India. UAE, Bahrain and other countries have such strict anti-terror laws that they have long been under attack from Left-leaning human rights groups. Experts and politicians from the Gulf have long been warning the West to keep away its bleeding heart and take Islamist terror seriously. In the coming days, this global cooperation will deepen. Georgia Meloni may differ from Marine Le Pen on support for Russia, but they are almost certain to be on the same page over immigration and Islamisation. Narendra Modi’s third innings as Prime Minister has started. India is unlikely to go soft on Islamists. Donald Trump is leading Joe Biden in the opinion polls by a seemingly unassailable margin, and if he becomes President again, he will certainly get tough on who gets to settle in America. Israel is in no mood to relent against jihad. Argentina’s Javier Milei is blunt on the subject as well. And in Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro is breathing down on the Leftist President Lula De Silva. Even Fumio Kishida’s Japan is not leaving anything to chance and is pumping millions of dollars in counterterrorism in the Asia-Pacific region. In the past, 87 countries had come together in a global coalition against ISIS. Such coalitions will become more formal, focused and ferocious against a savage enemy which burns down cities over real and imagined insults to its Prophet, lynches helpless men and women over blasphemy, or grooms ‘kafir’ girls for mass rape and conversion. Radical Islam is a brutal and determined imperialistic force that the civilised world will have to at some point shed its political correctness and deal with. It is going to be a matter of survival, not sanctimoniousness. The rise of the Right across the planet is a sign of that. Abhijit Majumder is a senior journalist.

    "article_content": "Written By : Ratan Sharda News18.com Last Updated: June 22, 2024, 18:25 IST New Delhi, India It is time for Hindus to reform themselves and not let casteist and communal forces exploit them and weaken the society. (Representative Image: PTI) It is said that “the road to hell is paved with good intentions”. Bharat has often fallen victim to such good intentions from our social and political leaders. A recent example is a report by retired High Court judge, Thiru K. Chandru, on resolving caste divisions. However, before analysing the report, I would like to share my concern about the selective reformism of ‘secular’ Hindu (even if in name) leaders. Their focus remains solely on reforming Hindu society, neglecting other religions and sects. We can leave aside the pre-Independence period when the British agenda was to keep society under their thumb, for which they did their best to create self-hate and low self-esteem in Indian society through every possible means, including inventing new theories like the Aryan Invasion theory and the north-south divide. They also institutionalised the caste system, exacerbating social divisions and undermining our once equitable education system. Unfortunately, we are still grappling with the consequences of these divisive strategies. The first gift that the Jawaharlal Nehru government post-Independence gave us was the Hindu Code Bill, though the Congress leaders had decided that Bharat would pursue the path of secularism, which would ordinarily mean that there would not be separate laws in the name of religion. However, we had Articles 25 to 30 favouring minorities and discriminating against the majority. The writers of the Indian Constitution never defined ‘minority’. The definition of Hindus was also a negative definition – those who were not Muslims, Christians, Parsis and Jews – meaning the people following religions born outside Bharat. A Times of India article notes that when Dr B R Ambedkar asked the Constituent Assembly to adopt the Uniform Civil Code, the Muslim members staunchly opposed it. All he could get was Article 44 of Directive principles commending the adoption of UCC. Thus, the effort to draft a common civil code culminated in the Hindu Code Bill, while other communities continued to be governed by their own personal laws. Notably, issues like dowry, adoption, polygamy, and divorce transcended religious boundaries, impacting other communities as well. Yet, they were left to grapple with orthodox laws, often rife with regressive and anti-women practices. Nehru felt that enacting a uniform code in the aftermath of Partition would fuel insecurity amongst the Muslims who chose to remain in India. (ibid) Nehru and subsequent Congress governments also opposed any laws to stop conversions, despite their own government in Madhya Pradesh conducting a thorough study of the conversion mafia. Nehru’s own statements suggest a naive belief that the Church’s conversion activities were motivated solely by a desire to “reform” Hindu society—a misguided attempt to uplift individuals from a “casteist” to a supposedly “casteless” faith. Just as India was embracing modernisation and progress, the Shah Bano case tragically reversed any momentum for reform within Muslim society. Rajiv Gandhi, Nehru’s grandson and then-Prime Minister, controversially amended the Constitution to deny Muslim women the right to alimony following divorce. This short-sighted move effectively slammed the door on the possibility of reforming Muslim Personal Laws through judicial means. The Mandal Commission was instituted to address the ills of Hindu society stemming from casteism. However, it did not address similar issues affecting Muslims and Christians. There was no scrutiny of the existence of separate churches among Christians or the prevalent caste bias within them, particularly against Dalits and Scheduled Tribes. Likewise, the nearly 72 sects within Islam, often at odds with each other and accused of perpetuating caste-based oppression, escaped similar scrutiny and calls for reform. Politicians primarily responded by incorporating many of these groups into SC-ST and OBC reservations, overlooking that their conversions were originally motivated by caste-based oppression. Once again, only Hindus were burdened with the responsibility for societal reform. Dravida Kazhagam-led reform movements were also meant only for Hindus, no other communities. Ironically, despite decades of uninterrupted rule, the oppression of ‘lower caste’ Hindus by ‘higher caste Hindus’—not Brahmins—has persisted, even though the majority of Brahmins have been largely marginalised in Tamil Nadu. In fact, a one-man committee was constituted under retired Madras High Court judge, K. Chandru, last August after two Dalit siblings were brutally assaulted by their relatively upper-caste classmates in Tirunelveli. This latest effort to ‘reform’ Hindu society is being undertaken by the DMK government. Tamil Nadu has witnessed violence against Dalits by both Muslims and relatively upper-caste Hindus, despite the state being governed by champions of social equality from various factions of the Dravida Kazhagam (DK). A careful reading of the news reveals such incidents occurring regularly. Ironically, almost all iterations of the DK in the political arena draw their support from specific castes and communities. It happens only in India that parties that denounce casteism and advocate for a casteless society are built upon caste-based voter blocs. This trend is observable in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar as well, where purported followers of Lohia have transformed into caste-centric parties like the Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Lok Dal, and numerous smaller splinter groups. The recent report by Justice Kundru proposes the periodic transfer of high school and higher secondary school teachers to prevent them from serving extended tenures in one location, especially in areas where their own caste holds influence. On the administrative front, the report suggests that chief educational officers, district educational officers, block educational officers, and headmasters of high and higher secondary schools should not be posted in regions dominated by their caste. This assumes that teachers are also impacted by caste biases. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar became Dr B.R. Ambedkar because his teacher, a member of a higher caste, gave him his surname. He was able to pursue education because Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III, another member of a higher caste, provided him with financial support. However, our leaders seem intent on perpetuating caste-based compartmentalisation. Other recommendations include banning caste markers such as wristbands, rings, or forehead marks on school premises. However, unless we change internally, these external efforts may not be effective. After the JP Narayan movement, many leaders opted to drop their surnames and adopt the ubiquitous ‘Kumar’ as their surname. Did this stop caste politics? Nitish Kumar is still considered a leader of Kurmis. While leaders should work diligently to reform Indian society by fostering values of non-discrimination, instilling discipline, and promoting patriotism that transcends regional, religious, and caste divisions, we witness the paradox of removing signs of caste and religion that connect individuals to their larger community and inspire adherence to good practices. If these signs are deemed discriminatory, why not advocate for the removal of similar practices and symbols in other communities? Shouldn’t efforts be made to discourage division by banning the wearing of crosses, topis, burqas, etc? Interestingly, the champions of reforming Hindu society—political parties, with the exception of the Dravida Kazhagam (DK), the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK), and Vaiko’s Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK)—also refrained from participating in the deliberations, including the ruling DMK. It shows that these parties basically wish to thrive on caste divisions; reforms are a sham. The report is another attempt to concretise the divisions. Hard data proves that when Hindus rise above caste divisions, the Bharatiya Janata Party scores well. Conversely, when Hindus are divided into caste groups, divisive forces have a field day. The Congress and parties like the SP and DMK have arguably promoted casteism in the name of reforms. Their goal, some argue, is to weaken Hindu society and strengthen minority communalism. This could explain their silence on social ills perpetuated in the name of other religions. It is time for Hindus to reform themselves and not let casteist and communal forces exploit them and weaken society. The writer is a well-known author and political commentator.

    "article_content": "Written By : Sushant Sareen News18.com Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 19:33 IST New Delhi, India A woman sits near her hut at the Koh-e-Sabz area of Pakistan's Balochistan province where Iran launched an airstrike, on January 18. (Image: Banaras KHAN/AFP) Pakistan President Asif Zardari is visiting Gwadar at a time when the fifth insurgency since 1947 in Balochistan is now in its third decade. In 2009 in his previous term as President, Zardari had tried to bribe the Baloch with a package of economic and political sops called ‘Aaghaz-e-Huqooq-e-Balochistan’. While Zardari’s that attempt to assuage the Baloch sentiment failed miserably, he is once again trying to reach out to the Baloch, but as usual with empty words and insincere assurances. During his visit he has called for political dialogue to bring prosperity, development and peace to the restive province. At the same time, he has called for enhancing the capacity of the law enforcement agencies. The incongruity of his message is clear to anyone who studies Balochistan: it is the lawlessness of the so-called ‘law enforcement’ and security agencies — the extortion, kidnapping, smuggling, narcotics and human trafficking networks they run — which makes them the greatest obstacle to peace in the province. What is more, the Punjab-dominated Pakistani state wants a dialogue not with genuine representatives of the Baloch but with those who will tow their line and remain subservient to the Punjabi establishment. The result is that Balochistan has continued to burn ever since it was forcibly occupied by Pakistan in 1948. Since then, Pakistan has managed to keep its stranglehold over Balochistan, but only through brute force and censorship of the type that would embarrass even the Chinese. When the first stirring of the latest and longest episode of Baloch anger against Pakistan’s neo-colonial exploitative and extractive rule started around 2001, no one expected it to last more than a few years. But the murder in 2006 of the venerable Bugti chieftain, Nawab Akbar Bugti, gave a major fillip to the Baloch movement. Since then the movement has ebbed and flowed but has continued to roll forward. Over the last three years, especially since the Afghan Taliban broke the “shackles of slavery” of not only the Americans but also the Pakistanis, the Baloch freedom struggle has shifted gears and gained more pace. Of course, if anyone was to go through Pakistan’s mainstream media, it would seem the Baloch movement has run out of steam. This is primarily because of a clampdown on media by the military to stop the flow of bad news. But just because nothing is coming in the news doesn’t mean nothing is happening on the ground. The fact is that the Baloch movement is acquiring dangerous dimensions. It has probably still not reached the tipping point where it threatens the territorial borders or constitutional structure of Pakistan, but it is slowly and surely getting there, aided in large part by the growing disorder and disaffection that has engulfed the state of Pakistan. The unrest in Balochistan is finding expression along two parallel tracks. Both of these are organic and entirely indigenous. No one in the rest of the world appears to be interested in even lending an ear to the grievances of the Baloch, let alone supporting them monetarily or materially. There is of course the militant track adopted by young Baloch cutting across class and tribal lines to challenge the might of the Pakistan Army. In recent years, there has been an increase in both the frequency as well as the ferocity in their attacks against the Pakistani state and its henchmen in uniform. The second track is that of peaceful protest, public mobilisation and resistance through a kind of civil disobedience. The protest track has galvanised the people like never before, something that was witnessed during the Haq Do Tehrik in Gwadar when thousands of people came out on the streets to press for their basic demand of right to life and livelihood. The Haq Do Tehrik went on for months in the face of the usual shenanigans of the Pakistan Army-run state machinery that tried every trick in the book — bribes, intimidation, brutal crackdowns — to break the morale of the people. In the end, the state had to agree to the demands. But as is the wont of colonial occupiers, they never delivered on their side of the bargain. It is these kinds of betrayals of peaceful protests that then feed into the militants’ arguments that only armed resistance will force the Pakistani state to end its oppressive and repressive rule. The same happened with the Long March led by the feisty young woman activist Dr Mahrang Baloch to Islamabad. In any genuinely democratic country, the authorities would not only have allowed the right to protest in Islamabad, but also dialogued with the protestors. But even the pretence of democracy has been given up by the hybrid regime that rules Pakistan — a civilian regime led by the puppet Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif whose strings are controlled by the military. Although Dr Mahrang Baloch wasn’t able to make any breakthrough with her demands on ending enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killings, even massacres, by the Pakistani security forces, she became an iconic figure in Balochistan. The mammoth crowds that turned out to receive her when she returned left no doubt that a new star, nay a new leader, had been discovered. Activists like Dr Mahrang Baloch is in itself a remarkable development in Balochistan where women activists are assuming leadership roles in what is a very conservative and orthodox society. Even more astonishing is the fact that women are not just leading political protests, they are also involved in militancy. The phenomenon of highly educated Baloch women activists becoming suicide bombers is something no one ever anticipated. Perhaps it is sheer desperation and despondency, the end of all hope, that has forced these women to take such a drastic step. For more than a decade, young and old Baloch women have been demonstrating and demanding to know the whereabouts of their husbands, sons, fathers, brothers who have been forcibly kidnapped by Pakistani security agencies. Most have probably been butchered by the Pakistan Army. There have been dozens of incidents of mutilated bodies of activists who were subjected to enforced disappearances being thrown on the roadside. There have even been cases of a few mass graves that have been uncovered. But there has been no closure for the Baloch, something that has continued to fuel militancy. Even today, young Baloch students and activists who are studying in Punjab and other provinces have ‘disappeared’. Every other day there are reports of young people, householders, professionals who are victims of enforced disappearances by the security forces. The current Chief Minister of Balochistan, Sarfraz Bugti, a man who is notorious as not just a complete puppet of the military establishment but also has been accused of being involved with state-sanctioned and supported death squads that hunt down and kill Baloch activists. He is now assuring the people that he will start a new process of reconciliation. But no one is biting. No one trusts him. There are, however, some signs of growing panic in the military establishment. Despite their brutality, and notwithstanding the thousands of people who have been forcibly disappeared or killed by the security forces, they haven’t been able to dampen the spirits and passions, nor lessen the disgust and contempt for Pakistan among the Baloch who keep struggling to break the shackles of slavery imposed on them by Pakistan. And this sentiment is growing, both politically as well as militarily. The reports of tacit and perhaps tactical and temporary alliances between some Baloch militant groups and the Pakistani Taliban have multiplied the dangers for the Pakistani state. Despite both sides being poles apart ideologically — the Baloch are progressive and security in their outlook while the Taliban are regressive and Islamists in their worldview — the prospect of a combined Baloch and Pashtun resistance against a common enemy is quite dreadful for Pakistan, and for the region. Even as the militancy picks up steam, the political mobilisation to challenge the Pakistani state progresses apace. The Pakistani mainstream media is of course ignoring the simmering situation in Balochistan. But just because the media is not reporting something, it doesn’t mean nothing is happening. In fact, this has been a long standing problem in Pakistan. Because of the muzzling of the media by the military, the people come to know of a disaster only when it is too late. Perhaps some of this can be addressed by social media. But even here there is an effort to impose censorship of the China variety. Ironically, Pakistanis are all outraged and enthused in equal measure by the Israeli action against Hamas and the widespread anti-Semitic and pro-Palestine, even pro-Hamas, protests in US university campuses. But inside Pakistan, there hasn’t been a whimper of protest from these same students, human rights activists, media persons, civil society butterflies over the repression that has been unleashed against the Baloch and Pashtuns by the Punjabis. In fact in campuses in Punjab, mobs of Punjabi students, most of them aligned to the Jamaat Islami, and backed by the university authorities and the military establishment have been carrying out attacks on the Baloch and Pashtun students for so much as celebrating their own culture. Instead of using protests and civil disobedience in Balochistan to take a political initiative and engage the representatives of the Baloch, the Pakistan Army has decided to crush it with brute force and foist their own Quislings like Sarfraz Bugti to suppress the voices of dissent. But that is only fuelling the anger against Pakistan and creating a situation that is fast reaching the point of too return. The only thing that has worked so far for Pakistan is the inability of the Baloch to unite under a common leadership — both political and military. This allows Pakistan to divide and rule by exploiting the petty egos of tribal chiefs, their mutual rivalries and feuds, and throwing some crumbs of power and privilege to win over otherwise discredited ‘nationalist’ politicians. Until the Baloch are able to unite under a common flag, Pakistan will continue its colonial approach and genocidal policy in Balochistan. The writer is Senior Fellow, Observer Research Foundation.

    "article_content": "Written By : Sagarneel Sinha News18.com Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 18:51 IST New Delhi, India Narendra Modi took oath as the Prime Minister of India for the third time in a row earlier this month. (AP File) Although the BJP-led NDA alliance fell short of its expected seat count in the Lok Sabha, it still secured a third consecutive term in government by winning 293 seats. However, the BJP, the largest party within the alliance, did not achieve a majority on its own as it had in the 2014 and 2019 elections, securing only 240 seats this time. These results have emboldened the Opposition, particularly the Congress party, which was able to increase its seats to 99. Since the declaration of the results on June 4, the jubilant Opposition and its ecosystem have been claiming that Modi has morally lost the election as voters have rejected the Modi-led BJP. These claims are being made to create a perception in favour of the Opposition. But these claims of the Opposition can’t belittle the fact that despite 10 years of anti-incumbency, the BJP-led NDA under the prime ministership of Narendra Modi has been able to return to power — a historic feat since the 1962 elections. Opposition shouldn’t forget the basic fact that the NDA is a pre-poll alliance fought with Modi as the face. Having said that, the BJP and its ecosystem have to accept the fact that challenges before Modi 3.0 government are numerous and these have to be addressed. One of the prominent issues is unemployment. It has been a burning issue in India, and the Modi government’s failure to adequately address it over the past ten years is widely seen as a significant factor in the BJP’s loss of 63 seats nationwide and its inability to secure a majority on its own. According to data provided by the Union government last year in the Parliament, there are nearly 10 lakh vacancies in various government departments. While the government has made efforts to fill these vacancies, including the distribution of over 1 lakh appointment letters to new recruits by PM Modi under Rozgar Mela, lakhs of vacancies still remain. Modi 3.0 should prioritise filling these public sector vacancies as jobs in this sector are particularly important to the common people. However, simply filling existing vacancies is unlikely to completely address the pressing unemployment issue. Therefore, the government must create more jobs, recognising the limitations of public sector employment generation. As a result, the government should focus on stimulating job creation in the private sector. Modi 3.0 has faced a turbulent start, with students expressing anger over alleged paper leaks in the National Eligibility-cum Entrance Test (NEET). The matter is currently before the Supreme Court. Adding to the challenges, the government has cancelled the UGC-NET exams based on available information, citing a need to protect students’ interests. This cancellation raises serious questions about the inefficiency of the administration to conduct exams in a fair manner. Allegation of paper leaks is a serious issue and cannot be taken lightly. These exams, whether NEET or UGC-NET, are crucial to students’ futures. This year, paper leaks in Uttar Pradesh’s police recruitment exams, followed by cancellations, exposed the state administration’s inefficiency. This affected 48 lakh students who had taken the exams, and the resulting dissatisfaction was reflected in the state’s Lok Sabha results, where the BJP lost 29 seats. The current issue regarding NEET exams and the cancellation of the UGC-NET exams have undoubtedly dealt a blow to the Modi 3.0 government, which has already seen a dip in popularity among voters. The government must take decisive action to ensure these exams are conducted fairly. Continued irregularities will only further erode the current administration’s standing. The recent Lok Sabha results have emboldened the Opposition, which has seized upon the alleged paper leak issue. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has yet to publicly address the matter, his silence has been interpreted by some as a sign of indifference, potentially damaging his image and alienating voters. This silence, combined with his limited public statements on the Manipur situation, has contributed to the BJP-led NDA’s loss in the two seats of the Northeastern state. By remaining silent on these critical issues, Prime Minister Modi risks allowing the Opposition to exploit the situation, potentially eroding public trust in his leadership. To strengthen its connection with the public, the government must establish a more effective communication system that involves ministers and MPs directly at the grassroots level. Over-reliance on bureaucrats for communication can be detrimental, as they often lack the nuanced understanding of local realities, including caste, religion, tradition, and culture, that elected representatives possess. By engaging more directly with communities, the government can better understand their needs and concerns. One of the key factors contributing to the BJP-led NDA’s victory is the government’s implementation of various welfare schemes over the past decade. Initiatives such as opening bank accounts, providing direct monetary aid for toilet construction, offering free gas cylinders, transferring funds to farmers three times annually, providing free medical check-ups up to Rs 5 lakh, and distributing 5 kg of free ration per person have undeniably benefitted recipients in ways unprecedented by previous governments. However, Modi 3.0 should not rest on the laurels of these existing schemes. Regular review and adjustments are crucial, as welfare programs address short-term goals and must adapt to changing circumstances. Despite initial successes, there are allegations that some schemes are no longer effectively meeting current needs. Take, for instance, the Ujjwala Yojana. Many beneficiaries are unable to refill their free gas cylinders due to rising prices, rendering the scheme less effective. This issue, coupled with the government’s failure to address the price increase, received little mention among voters during the recent elections. Similarly, the government should reassess its decision to provide 5 kg of free ration to over 80 crore people. Within this large group, there are marginalised families whose needs exceed the current ration allotment. The government should identify these families and increase their rations accordingly. Additionally, a thorough review is needed to determine if all 80 crore families are actually receiving the benefit and if this level of free ration is truly necessary for all recipients. One of the prominent government schemes is the Jan Aushadhi scheme, which provides medicines at low prices. Unfortunately, this scheme isn’t widely discussed. Despite receiving little attention in the mainstream media, high medicine prices are a crucial issue for a large part of the population — and the Jan Aushadhi scheme was launched to address this. However, this scheme, despite helping some, isn’t working as well as expected. Jan Aushadhi stores carry medicines with generic names, but doctors often don’t prescribe medicines by their generic names. This creates problems for beneficiaries looking for medicines in Jan Aushadhi stores. Additionally, many essential medicines are often not found in these stores. The loopholes in this important scheme need to be reviewed, considering the large section of the population already worried about rising medicine prices.

(File Photo) A 46-minute documentary, ‘Spies, secrets and threats: How the Modi regime targets people overseas’, broadcasted by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and featuring the infamous Australian journalist Avani Dias, declared its extreme antagonism towards the Hindu-centric Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Through this documentary, the state-run ABC also targeted the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), whose senior leader, Narendra Modi, has been elected prime minister for a third consecutive term. The ABC documentary and Dias reek of bias and misrepresentation, constantly presenting the RSS as a paramilitary group despite its long-standing efforts as a cultural and service-oriented movement. Widely recognised as the world’s largest voluntary organisation, the RSS is dedicated to community service, particularly for the deprived sections of Indian communities. Overlooking this, Dias intentionally distorted its image, dismissing its substantial contributions to a larger society. Selfless service work carried out by the RSS volunteers, inspired by its founder Dr Keshav Baliram Hedgewar’s pre-independence movement experiences, has been largely ignored or intentionally set aside to paint a shady picture of an open flexible organisation. Avani Dias seems to have blinded herself and the ABC viewers to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s service activities through over 120,000 projects in areas ranging from education and healthcare to socio-economic empowerment. These projects have positively impacted millions of families in India. A whopping 2.145 million individuals and families in Bharat have benefitted and continue to be supported by projects across various sectors, contributing to improved living standards. Beneficiaries in the healthcare sector separately have crossed 8.716 million and food support programmes have touched 2.735 million. Community well-being and development are the underlying objectives of RSS volunteers’ efforts, which are comprehensive and unique in their organisation. Dias argued that minorities lack sufficient opportunities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, a claim seemingly supported by the ABC editorial board. However, this claim is factually incorrect and is contradicted by evidence of the Indian government’s welfare initiatives aimed at minorities since 2014. For example, the Maulana Azad National Fellowship (MANF) provides five years of financial assistance, while the Padho Pardesh scheme offers interest subsidies for studying abroad at the Masters, MPhil, and PhD levels. The ‘Seekho aur Kama’ (Learn & Earn) initiative, in place since 2013-14, focuses on skill development for minorities, equipping young people with modern and traditional skills tailored to market demands. Additionally, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) targets the development of essential community infrastructure in underserved areas, aiming to improve the living standards of minority populations. Despite these existing initiatives with their stated goals, Dias seems to have peddled anti-India agendas and divisive ideas. The documentary’s most glaring flaw is its blatant endorsement of Pakistan-backed Khalistani terrorism. The script reads as though Khalistani supporters themselves crafted it, with Dias serving merely as their mouthpiece. This is a blatant attack on journalistic integrity and an insult to sufferers of Khalistani terrorism. In the 1980s, Khalistani terrorists unleashed a wave of horrific violence in Punjab, India, brutally murdering thousands of innocent people. Yet, Dias selectively disregarded this grave and historical truth, shamefully overlooking the horrific adversity and bloodshed caused by these separatists. Dias parrots the Khalistani narrative, falsely claiming that Sikhs are victims under pressure in Australia. The fact is otherwise. A handful of aggressive Khalistani extremists have continued their campaign of violence and terror not just in India, but also in other nations including Australia. In less than a month, pro-Khalistani outfits in Australia launched three distinct attacks on Hindu temples. On January 23, 2023, Hare Krishna Temple in Albert Park, Melbourne came under attack. On January 17, 2023, Melbourne’s historic Shiva Vishnu Temple at Carrum Downs was targeted. On January 12, 2023, Khalistan activists vandalised and destroyed BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir, a Hindu temple in Melbourne, by spray-painting anti-India graffiti. The walls of Melbourne’s landmark Swaminarayan temple in the northern suburbs of Mill Park have been spray-painted with ‘Hindustan Murdabad’ slogans. Hundreds of innocent Indians in Australia have been threatened or abused by these terrorists, a reality that Dias completely ignores. Instead, she promotes Khalistani propaganda while overlooking their ongoing terrorist activities and the true threat they pose to peace and security. It’s important to note that not the entire Sikh community in India, Australia, or elsewhere endorses this divisive agenda. Despite the documentary’s contentious storylines, it is crucial to highlight India and Australia’s developing strategic, economic and bilateral relations. Both countries have worked together extensively on a range of issues, including trade, defence, education, and cultural exchange. The relationship is based on mutual respect and democratic values with the goal of enhancing regional stability and economic progress. The documentary’s description of chronic animosity and conflict is refuted by the upward trend in Indo-Australian relations. Collaborative initiatives in education, technology, and counter-terrorism demonstrate both countries’ commitment to fostering a robust and long-term alliance. Dias’s report is a textbook example of biased and irresponsible journalism. It misrepresents the RSS, glorifies Khalistani crimes and dismisses recent improvements in Indo-Australian ties. This kind of reporting does more than just misinform; it actively fosters division and provides a platform for dangerous radical agendas. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation must be held accountable for airing such a blatantly biased and factually flawed story. True journalism should strive for honest representation, not act as a propaganda tool for violent extremists. Avani Dias’s report is a disservice to the profession and, most importantly, to the countless individuals who have suffered at the hands of the terrorists whose ideology she so blatantly promotes.

    "article_content": "Published By : Nishad Thaivalappil Trending Desk Last Updated: May 14, 2024, 12:42 IST Mumbai, India All dogs must be at least 6 months old, according to the new rules. Travelling the world with your dog can be a dream come true for many pet parents. It allows you to create unforgettable memories with your furry best friend. But, it is important to acknowledge that travelling with a dog is not always sunshine and paw prints. Though many countries have made it extremely convenient for passengers to travel with their pets, there are some countries that have implemented new rules that make travelling a bit difficult. Speaking on similar lines, the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted some new rules in the federal register on Wednesday, May 8, that will take effect on August 1 when a temporary 2021 order expires. The 2021 order suspended bringing in dogs from more than 100 countries where rabies is still an issue. Emily Pieracci, a rabies expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was involved in drafting the updated regulations, said, “This new regulation is going to address the current challenges that we’re facing. More people travel internationally with their pets, and more rescue groups and breeders have set up overseas operations to meet the demand for pets. Now, about 1 million dogs enter the US each year,” reported the Hindustan Times. Mentioned below are the latest rules by the government that need to be abided by if you are planning to take your dogs with you on your trip to the US. The media outlet further mentioned that there may be other restrictions and requirements depending on where the dog was in the past six months, which may include blood testing from CDC-approved laboratories. These rules come after four rabid dogs were identified as entering the US in 2015. US officials were worried that more might get through. Moreover, CDC officials also saw an increase in fraudulent or incomplete rabies vaccination certificates. They also noticed that more puppies were denied entry as they weren’t old enough to be fully vaccinated. These updated regulations grabbed a range of public opinions, including Angela Passman, a board member for the International Pet and Animal Transportation Association, who supports the new rules and says that it can be especially tricky for families that buy/adopt a dog overseas and then try to bring it to the state. It is definitely more work for the pet owners, but the end result is a good thing for all. However, Jennifer Skiff, who works for Animal Wellness Action, a Washington-based group focused on preventing animal abuse and assisting organisations in importing animals, stated that some of the changes are unwarranted and expensive, reported the media outlet."

From the ancient tombs of Hegra, the country’s first UNESCO World Heritage Site, to the breathtaking views atop Al Qarah Mountain, visitors are treated to a diverse array of attractions. The historical district of Diriyah, the pristine Red Sea coast, the snowy peaks of Jabal Al Lawz, and the traditional cuisine at Al-Najdiyah Village all provide unforgettable experiences. Iconic landmarks like Elephant Rock further showcase Saudi Arabia’s unique and enchanting scenery. Saudi’s most fascinating destinations for first-time visitors: What leaves visitors in awe is not just the view from the top of the mountain, but also its mystical caves. The caves are a result of the Al Qarah Mountain sitting at the eastern border of the Shadqam plateau, connecting to Kuwait and Iraq in the north and the Rub Al Khali desert in the south. The Red Sea is indeed a perfect spot for scuba diving expeditions to explore nearby wrecks and discovery sites. Adults can also flyboard against the beautiful Red Sea sunset. While there are a wide range of mountain experiences to witness in the region, snow seekers should lace up their boots and venture to Jabal Al Lawz, which means “Almond Mountain” in Arabic. Measuring 2,549 meters, it’s the tallest mountain in the Tabuk Province and the only place in Saudi where it snows almost every year — making it perfect for a winter hike."

    "article_content": "Written By : Dishya Sharma Edited By: Shreeja Bhattacharya News18.com Last Updated: June 03, 2024, 19:00 IST Mumbai, India Adventure sports to do in Ras Al Khaimah. (Pic: Dishya Sharma/Visit Ras Al Khaimah website) One mention of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the first city that comes to mind is Dubai. But what if we tell you there is another gem we discovered recently and it has the best of both worlds — the breeze of the sea and the breathtaking view of the clouds on the mountain tops? Yup, on the northwest side of the country resides a laidback yet adventurous Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) which is the home to some of the boldest adventure sports. Featured on CNN Travel’s ‘best destinations to visit in 2023’, Ras Al Khaimah has something for every adventure junkie. Let’s start with the waters. Water adventures in Ras Al Khaimah: Ras Al Khaimah houses a stretch of island along the country’s west coast and each island portion homes some of the best resorts the city has to offer. For example, in the south of the island stretch resides the luxury resort Mövenpick Resort Al Marjan Island which offers ample water sports options. One of which is Ras Al Khaimah’s biggest floating water park, built by Wibit, paddleboarding, and kayaking. Many resorts such as Waldorf Astoria, Hilton, Rixos, Rotana, Ritz-Carlton, Radisson, and the world’s largest Hampton Resort by Hilton also offer other water-based sports that will give you the perfect adrenaline rush. The Royal Yacht Club of Ras Al Khaimah also offers yachting and sailing for water sports enthusiasts. We would recommend you to call the club to get all the details. Air-Based Activities in Ras Al Khaimah: Up Above the World So High: You might see people paragliding and skydiving across the globe, but have you seen people — non-pilots — flying planes? Well, Ras Al Khaimah allows you to fly a plane (obviously under the guidance of a certified pilot). Head to the Al Jazirah Aviation Club for the extravagant experience. Recently, News18.com got a chance to sit in one of the aircraft and it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The pilots not only show you a view of the city and Al Marjan Island — the island area of Ras Al Khaimah — but they also give you an opportunity to take charge of the handle and learn a few tricks. As per the management of the club, those interested in learning the troops of flying can register for classes. Coming Through: Besides the flying lessons, Ras Al Khaimah also offers one of the longest zipline experiences in the world. Situated in the Jebel Jais mountain peak, the ‘Jais Flight’ is 1680 metres above sea level and is 2.83 km long. The adrenaline-fueled zipline gives you a gorgeous view of the deep ravines and canyons and if you are lucky, you also get to fly through clouds. A post shared by Visit Ras Al Khaimah (@visitrasalkhaimah) Apart from the zipline, the tall mountain of Ras Al Khaimah also offers a paragliding experience adventure lovers also have a chance to paraglide from the top of Jebel Jais. Called the Jais Wings, the paragliding experience gives a breathtaking view of the Arabic land. The mountain range also offers activities such as The Bear Grylls Explorers Camp which includes mountain biking, hiking and climbing that is bound to quench your thirst for adventure. Rolling Our Way Down: Jebel Jais also offers a roller coaster ride, called Jais Sledder. The sledder gives you full control of speed and break, making the roller coaster experience very personalised. News18.com got a chance to experience it and while we had a ball, we would like to warn you that it isn’t for the weakhearted. The ride is open from Tuesday to Sunday 11:00 am to 5:30 pm. Tickets are sold at the counter only. The mountain range also offers a few challenging treks. Besides the sports, the mountain range also boasts restaurants that give you the perfect view of the valley. How to reach Ras Al Khaimah? There are two ways to reach Ras Al Khaimah from India. Most flight services to Ras Al Khaimah are offered by Indigo. While the airline offers a direct flight from Mumbai and Kozhikode, the airline offers one-stop flight services for cities such as Hyderabad, Chennai, New Delhi and Chandigarh, to name a few. Another way to reach Ras Al Khaimah is to book a flight to Dubai and head to the city by road. The city is just an hour away from the Dubai airport."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Lifestyle Desk News18.com Last Updated: May 31, 2024, 14:15 IST New Delhi, India From chasing dreams to navigating destinations, their stories unveil the realities behind the glamour of flying. In the bustling world of aviation, cabin crews play an indispensable role, ensuring the safety and comfort of passengers while embodying the spirit of hospitality. On this International Cabin Crew Day, we delve into the lives of Neeharika Chaturvedi and Roerich Mukherjee, Inflight Supervisors from Vistara, who share their heartfelt stories and the driving forces behind their high-flying careers. Their narratives are filled with passion, dedication, and a profound sense of responsibility, offering us a glimpse into the dynamic and often misunderstood world of flight attendants. Neeharika and Roerich candidly discuss their journeys, from the initial allure of travel to the everyday realities of their roles. They debunk common myths and reveal the challenges they face, from managing medical emergencies to maintaining a delicate balance between their professional and personal lives. Through their eyes, we gain a deeper appreciation for the resilience and commitment required to navigate the skies, making each flight a seamless and memorable experience for passengers. Join us as we explore their inspiring stories and celebrate the unsung heroes of the skies. Neeharika: I found my calling to join the cabin crew while working as a travel consultant. Seeing my friends explore captivating destinations through their work sparked my desire to embark on my own adventure. Transitioning from planning trips for others to experiencing them firsthand felt like a natural progression, filled with excitement. Initially drawn by the allure of travel and meeting new people, I quickly embraced the responsibility that comes with the crucial role of a cabin crew. Contrary to my initial assumptions of simply serving meals and beverages, I discovered the importance of ensuring the safety and comfort of customers throughout the flight. This realization added depth and significance to my journey, making each flight a rewarding experience filled with opportunities to make a difference. Roerich: What first drew me to becoming a cabin crew member was the chance to travel and explore new places, and quenching my wanderlust. I also looked forward to meeting people from all walks of life and learning from those experiences while doing my job. Although I did get to visit various destinations, leisure time was limited, and professional responsibilities often took precedence over personal enjoyment. Neeharika: A typical day for me as a cabin crew member is both dynamic and multifaceted, depending largely on the flight schedule and route. Each day starts with detailed pre-flight preparations, where we gather for a thorough briefing to go over flight details and operational procedures. This is followed by welcoming everyone on board, organizing the cabin and ensuring a comfortable setting for our customers. While assisting the customers with their carry-on items during boarding, I strive to make the process seamless and efficient. Once we are airborne, my responsibilities expand to offering exemplary in-flight services, while attentively monitoring customers’ comfort and safety. I remain vigilant to ensure the well-being of all on board. Upon landing, I facilitate the disembarkation process and conduct a thorough final cabin inspection. In addition to these tasks, I collaborate closely with the flight deck crew and adhere to all safety protocols diligently. It is a profession that is both rewarding and challenging, requiring a high level of dedication and adaptability. Roerich: My day begins early with three alarms to ensure I am up and about. I meticulously pack my flight bag, organize my documents, iron my uniform, and polish my shoes. After a hearty breakfast, I review relevant SOPs, circulars, and notifications during my commute. Upon arrival at the crew reporting center, my team and I swiftly sign in, undergo a breath analyzer test, and attend a briefing. We then ensure timely departure to the aircraft. Our pre-flight routine includes thorough checks and coordination with ground support departments like catering, ground services, and engineering to guarantee on-time performance and a seamless, safe flight experience for our passengers and ourselves. After landing, we debrief to discuss the day’s events and complete necessary voyage and special reports. Throughout all these tasks, maintaining decorum and a positive demeanour is paramount. Neeharika: While I am improving my abilities, one of the significant hurdles I encounter is effectively managing non-routine situations, encompassing medical emergencies, disruptive behavior, and unexpected delays/ turbulence. Roerich: Among the challenges are variation in meal choices as against an anticipated expectation, diversions prompted by weather or medical emergencies onboard, ground delays with customers onboard, and handling unruly or intoxicated customers. Neeharika: We undergo rigorous three-month training sessions, complemented by frequent refresher courses, to familiarize ourselves with established guidelines and procedures. Ensuring safety of all on board involves constant vigilance and situational awareness. This includes conducting thorough pre-flight checks, mastering emergency protocols, maintaining pristine cabin conditions, fostering clear communication, and remaining attentive throughout the flight. Roerich: As cabin crew, our main focus is customer safety, comfort and their overall wellbeing. We follow stringent procedures based on our robust trainings and protocols. We also pay close attention to each situation and exhibit empathy in our interactions. We aim to cater to the needs of our customers to the best of our ability, going above and beyond to make their experience unforgettable. Neeharika: In my aviation career, I have encountered various challenging situations, including medical emergencies, aborted take-offs, disruptive behaviour, and delays. In such instances, maintaining composure, conducting thorough analysis before taking action, and staying situationally aware is paramount. Providing prompt and accurate information to address customer inquiries is crucial. Amidst these challenges, there are memorable moments derived from simple acts of kindness. Whether it’s offering an extra dessert or lending a patient ear to a customer, bringing a smile to someone’s face brightens my day. Roerich: On one of the flights, we faced the distressing circumstance of a child’s passing onboard, despite our best efforts and the assistance of a doctor. The crew members were understandably devastated. However, we had to compose ourselves to operate the return flight. Asking the team to conceal their emotions and maintain a cheerful demeanor for the incoming customers was incredibly difficult, given the heaviness in our hearts. Nonetheless, we greeted our customers with genuine smiles, served them attentively, and bid them farewell with professionalism, despite the emotional toll we endured. Neeharika: There are prevalent myths about the cabin crew profession. One is the belief that it’s a glamorous job with constant travel to exotic places. While travel is part of the job, it also involves intensive working hours, dynamic schedules, and time away from loved ones. Another myth is that cabin crew only serve meals onboard. In reality, they have important responsibilities, including ensuring customer safety, maintaining security, managing medical emergencies onboard and providing exceptional customer service. Roerich: Contrary to popular belief, the cabin crew lifestyle isn’t always about glamorous travel and luxury. While it might seem exciting at first, the reality often involves hard-work, exploring destinations with limited time at hand, and missing the comforts of home. Additionally, the job entails frequent exams, weight management requirements, and working odd hours, leading to jet lag and time away from family during special occasions like birthdays or festivals. However, despite these challenges, the job offers valuable experiences and opportunities for personal growth. Neeharika: For those aspiring a career as cabin crew, I recommend preparing for a dynamic work setting and continually honing skills. A positive attitude, exceptional communication, and a customer-centric mindset are crucial attributes that develop with experience. Although the job can be demanding, it offers many rewarding experiences. Staying focused, motivated, and adaptable to different in-flight scenarios is important. Key qualities include communication, problem-solving, teamwork, adaptability, cultural awareness, and proficiency in safety procedures. Patience, composure and agility are indispensable traits for cabin crew members. Roerich: For aspiring cabin crew, I suggest gathering comprehensive insights into the job’s demands and rewards to make an informed decision. It’s a career tailor-made for those passionate about travel, cultural exchange, and interaction with people from across geographies. Skills such as composure, effective communication, empathy, determination, patience, and time management are invaluable in this role, where quick and sound decision-making is essential."

(Image: X) Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded his 45-hour-long meditation at the famous Vivekananda Rock Memorial at Kanniyakumari in Tamil Nadu on Saturday, June 1. After rigorous campaigning for about two months across the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took some time out to mediate as the seventh and last phase of polling was set to start on Saturday. He began his 45-hour meditation at the iconic Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari on Thursday, after the campaigning for the Lok Sabha elections ended. PM Modi meditated at the Dhyana Mandapam of the iconic tourist spot. It’s believed that it’s the same place where Swami Vivekananda realised his divine enlightenment. Apart from being a popular tourist spot, the Vivekananda Rock Memorial holds a significant place in India’s cultural and spiritual traditions. According to a legend, the goddess Kanyakumari prayed to Lord Shiva atop this rock, making it an important place for the followers of the Hindu religion. There is a preserved part on the granite rock which is believed to be carrying the goddess Kanyakumari’s footprint. The memorial is also a beautiful combination of many architectural styles. The Sripada Mandapam and Vivekananda Mandapam are two structures to explore at the memorial. There is also a life-size bronze statue of Swami Vivekananda on the property. The rock is bordered by the Laccadive Sea, where the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean, and the Arabian Sea converge. The memorial was built to mark Swami Vivekananda’s 100th birth anniversary. Swami Vivekananda, a 19th-century philosopher and spiritual leader, is celebrated for introducing India’s spiritual legacy to the world at the 1893 Parliament of World Religions in Chicago, United States. How and When To Visit? The Vivekananda Rock Memorial is nearly 90 km away from the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport and about 240 km away from Madurai International Airport. If you decide to take a train journey, it is about 1.3 km away from the Kanniyakumari Station. For a road trip you can take a bus from cities like Thiruvananthapuram, Madurai, Coimbatore, Puducherry and Chennai to Kanniyakumari. The memorial is about 21 km away from the bus stand. The best time to visit Kanniyakumari is from November to March when the weather is cool and pleasant. Summers can be extremely hot due to the tropical environment in the region."

(Representative image) There are reports that the centre government is considering raising the income tax exemption limit. The increase would likely be under the new tax regime, which offers lower tax rates but fewer deductions. This move is intended to give more disposable income to individuals, especially those in the lower income bracket. The announcement is expected in the upcoming budget, likely to be presented in mid-July 2024. According to a report by Moneycontrol , the move is aimed at bolstering the country’s GDP growth by stimulating consumption amidst subdued spending levels among the middle class. The government is planning to raise the income threshold for tax liability from the current Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh in the forthcoming budget. This adjustment is intended exclusively for taxpayers under the new regime, aiming to increase disposable income, especially among lower-income groups. ‘Tax Exemption For Rs 15 Lakh Income’ Another report by news agency Reuters stated that the government is considering lowering personal tax rates for certain categories of individuals, which could help boost consumption in Asia’s third-largest economy. A post-poll survey by Reuters showed that voters were worried about inflation, unemployment and decreasing incomes. While the Indian economy grew at a world-beating 8.2% in 2023-24, consumption has grown at half that pace. A cut in personal tax could boost consumption in the economy and increase savings for the middle class, the sources told Reuters . The category of individuals that may see some tax relief are those earning over Rs 15 lakh annually, up to a certain amount which is yet to be determined, the first source said. The changes could be made to a tax scheme introduced in 2020, where annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at 5%-20% while earnings over Rs 15 lakh are taxed at 30%. The personal tax rate jumps six-fold when an individual’s income increases by five times from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 15 lakh, “which is quite steep,” the second source said. The government may also explore lowering personal tax rates for annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh, said the first source, adding that a new threshold was being discussed for income taxed at the highest rate of 30% under the old tax system. Any loss of tax income to the government through tax cuts could be partially offset by increased consumption from this category of income earners, the second source said. The government is targeting a fiscal deficit of 5.1% of GDP in the financial year ending March 2025. Strong tax collections amid a buoyant economy and a bumper dividend from the central bank will give the government flexibility in planning the first budget of its new term, Reuters reported earlier."

This proposal, suggested by the law committee, aims to address tax notices issued where lower taxes were paid due to interpretation issues or lack of clarity in the law. “The Law Committee recommended that a provision may be incorporated in GST laws empowering the central and state governments to regularize, based on the recommendations of the GST Council, non–levy or short levy of GST or Compensation Cess where it is found that such non-levy or short levy was a result of general practice in the trade or a section of trade. Law Committee also recommended that no refund of GST or Compensation Cess may be allowed on account of any notification issued in this regard”, the proposal states. According to an Economic Times report, the law committee has recommended the introduction of a new Section 11A to the CGST Act. This section would empower the government to refrain from recovering GST that was not levied or was under-levied due to prevalent general practices. The GST Council is set to deliberate on this recommendation at its upcoming meeting on June 22. If approved, this amendment would enable authorities to quash tax demands raised retrospectively, offering significant relief to the online gaming industry. However, the amendment does not address the issue of overpaid taxes. Companies that have paid excess GST due to these practices will not be eligible for refunds. The council will decide on this recommendation from the Law Committee at the forthcoming meeting and may also decide how to treat the demand notices sent of around Rs. 1.5 lakh crore to 80 online gaming companies in India. The 52nd GST Council, at its October 2023 meeting, had decided to impose a 28 per cent GST on the initial bet amount, with a pending six-month review to be revisited in the upcoming meeting. However, sources indicate that the government remains firm on the current taxation approach on online gaming, citing regulatory benefits and a significant increase in tax revenue since the GST’s introduction. Goods and services tax collections from online gaming have risen by as much as 400 per cent, to an average of Rs 1,200 crore a month, since the new regime took effect on October 1, 2023. Gaming Stocks Trade Higher Shares of online gaming players Delta Corp and Nazara Tech are trading higher after a news report suggested the GST Council could consider amendment to the CGST Act to quash retrospective tax demands. The gaming industry has been seeking a more favourable taxation regime from the government. At 11am, shares of Delta Corp were up over 12 per cent while Nazara Tech too seen a spike in share price early in trade. In the past one month, the share prices of Delta Corp are higher by 23 per cent and that of Nazara is up by 40 per cent."

About 84 percent of India Inc. has expressed strong support for the GST implementation and has called for progressive steps to take the regime to a new level. According to Deloitte India’s third edition of the GST@7 survey, confidence in the reform has significantly increased from 59 percent in 2022 and 72 percent in 2023 to 84 percent in 2024. Also Read: No Early Recover Of GST Before Stipulated Period Unless Critical, CBIC Issues Latest Instructions The survey highlights the areas where more reforms are required; these include rationalising tax rates, offering an effective dispute resolution process, removing credit restrictions, adopting faceless assessments, liberalising export rules and implementing a compliance rating system. Some of these crucial recommendations are expected to be key discussion points at the upcoming GST Council meeting on June 22, 2024. Marking the seven-year journey of GST, Deloitte India surveyed to capture India Inc.’s views on this transformational tax reform. As per the survey, 88 percent of the top C-suite leaders indicated areas of challenge, including aspects around audits and assessments, underscoring the need for continued simplification, technology integration and capacity building. There is also widespread feedback for enabling effective dispute-resolution mechanisms, with 91 percent of leaders endorsing the extension of audit timelines to address issues and improve compliance. Additionally, more than 70 percent of respondents advocated for aligning pre-deposit requirements for GST appeals with the pre-GST era norms, aiming to streamline the dispute resolution processes. Mahesh Jaising, partner and leader, Indirect Tax, Deloitte India, said, “ The survey reveals that it is time to push for further reforms to make the regime more robust, dynamic and responsive to taxpayers’ needs. GST 2.0 should review the possibility of expanding the GST regime’s tax base, rationalising tax rates, removing ITC restrictions, further export liberalisation for services, unlocking working capital and addressing concerns related to operational areas of compliance.” MSME Boost To support the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) sector, the survey suggests easing GST registration by implementing streamlined processes, such as virtual verification and standard documentation across the country. These measures can help MSMEs effectively navigate compliance challenges and contribute more robustly to India’s economic growth. Jaising added, “78 percent of MSMEs have shared a positive sentiment towards GST implementation this year versus 66 percent in 2023. Nearly 70 percent of respondents continue to believe that the quarterly filing of returns for MSMEs is beneficial and improves compliance. Specifically, the key positive area for 70 percent of MSMEs has been called out to be supply chain efficiencies.” “Key initiatives sought by MSMEs are paperless invoicing and that uniform registration guidelines across India will significantly ease compliance burdens. Matching concept challenges of MSMEs in 2023 were at 64 percent and are now down to 37 percent, indicating that this area is more streamlined now,” Jaising said. The survey highlights the profound influence of GST on various sectors, with competitive pricing of goods and services recognised by 73 percent of respondents as one of the most significant positive outcomes. Automation of tax compliance continues to be voted as a top performance area by industry leaders, followed by enhanced stakeholder engagement and the issuance of clarificatory circulars/instructions.

Currently, banks are required to deduct tax when interest income from deposits held in all the bank branches put together is more than Rs 40,000 in a year. About savings accounts, interest earned up to Rs 10,000 is exempt from tax. Union minister for finance & corporate affairs, Nirmala Sitharaman, on Wednesday, chaired the first pre-budget consultation with India’s leading economists. This crucial meeting set the stage for the upcoming full budget formulation, bringing together top economic minds to provide valuable insights and recommendations. The meeting was also attended by senior officials from the ministry. Also Read: ‘Ache Din’ For Taxpayers Soon? Govt Plans To Hike Income Tax Exemption Limit, Check Latest Details Here Incentive To Depositors “If at all some relief could be given in the Budget regarding tax on the interest earnings, it will be an incentive to depositors. Eventually, the banking sector uses deposits mobilised for the capital formation in the country,” the SBI chairman told PTI in an interview. The Full Budget for 2024-25 is likely to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Parliament next month. Given the current economic growth rate, the SBI chairman is expecting 14-15 per cent loan growth during the fiscal year 2024-25. “Normally the way we look at it is that the GDP growth rate plus inflation and 2-3 per cent over that. That gives us the number around 14 per cent or so,” he said. “Hence, 14-15 per cent credit growth depends upon the opportunities available for lending, and it meets our risk appetite. We will be happy to grow at this pace,” he said. As far as deposits are concerned, he said, it grew by 11 per cent last year. “And we have some elbow room available in terms of excess SLR…which ensures that we don’t have any pressure on us to raise the deposit rates for supporting our loan-to-deposit ratio,” he said. The bank has an excess Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) between Rs 3.5 lakh crore and Rs 4 lakh crore. “Incidentally, I may add here that our loan-to-deposit ratio is around 68-69 per cent only. That leaves enough room for us to lend without having pressure on the deposit interest rates. Nevertheless, he said, “We always give importance to deposits. That is the reason why we increased the interest rate for the short-term deposits recently because we felt that there’s room for improvement…we should improve our deposit growth rate to some extent during this year. And our effort would be that we should at least grow around 12-13 per cent this year.” Last month, SBI hiked the fixed deposit rate on select short-term maturity up to 75 basis points. For retail term deposits of 46-179 days, the rate increased by 75 basis points to 5.50 per cent against the earlier 4.75 per cent."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Mohammad Haris News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 14:25 IST New Delhi, India As the Budget for the financial year 2024-25 approaches, there are reports that the government might raise the income tax exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh. As the Budget for the financial year 2024-25 approaches, there are reports that the government might raise the income tax exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh, as against the current Rs 2.5 lakh. This potential change has brought renewed interest in understanding the distinctions between income tax exemption, rebate, and deductions. Here’s a detailed breakdown of these terms and their implications. Tax Exemption Income tax exemption refers to the portion of income on which no tax is levied. Currently, the income tax exemption is applicable up to a total annual income of Rs 2.5 lakh. This means that if an individual earns Rs 2.5 lakh or less in a year, he or she does not need to pay any income tax. For incomes above this threshold, only the amount exceeding Rs 2.5 lakh is subject to tax. New Tax Regime vs Old Tax Regime AY 2024-25: How to Choose Best Option for Filing ITR Tax exemptions provide complete relief from taxes for specific parts of income rather than the gross total income. Examples include House Rent Allowance (HRA) and Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) under the Income Tax Act, 1961. These exemptions are typically applicable to income under the head of salary or capital gains, provided certain criteria are met. Tax Deductions Income tax deductions pertain to reductions in taxable income based on specific investments or expenses. These are primarily available to taxpayers opting for the old tax regime. Notable sections under which deductions can be claimed include: Section 80C: Deductions for investments in life insurance premiums, public provident fund (PPF), and tuition fees, among others. Section 80D: Deductions for medical insurance premiums. Section 80E: Deductions for interest on education loans. Unlike exemptions, which provide relief on specific income parts, deductions reduce the overall taxable income, thereby lowering the tax liability. Tax Rebate Tax rebate refers to a reduction in the total tax payable, applicable after the total tax is calculated. Under Section 87A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, a rebate is provided for incomes up to a certain limit, currently set at Rs 7 lakh for FY 2023-24. This means if an individual’s total income does not exceed Rs 7 lakh, they are eligible for a tax rebate, making their effective tax liability zero. ITR Filing 2024: How To Verify TDS Details In Form 26AS? However, if the income surpasses this threshold, tax is payable on the entire income, excluding the exempted portion. For example, if an individual earns Rs 5.1 lakh, they must pay tax on Rs 2.6 lakh (considering the current exemption limit of Rs 2.5 lakh). The rebate is essentially a tax refund from the gross tax liability, aimed at reducing the tax burden for individuals in the lower-income category. Potential Changes and Implications An income tax expert, who did not want to be named, said that with the upcoming Budget, there are speculations that the government might increase the income tax exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh. If implemented, this would mean: Increased Exemption: Total annual income up to Rs 5 lakh would be completely tax-free. Impact on Rebate: The current rebate under Section 87A might be adjusted or restructured to align with the new exemption limits. Deductions: Taxpayers might need to reassess their tax-saving investments and expenses under the old regime, considering the increased exemption."

The council may also discuss the recommendations made by the Standing Committee on Chemicals and Fertilisers in February to reduce GST on nutrients and raw materials in the interest of fertiliser manufacturing companies and farmers, news agency PTI reported. Currently, GST at a 5 per cent rate is charged on fertilisers, while raw materials like Sulphuric Acid and Ammonia face a higher GST at 18 per cent. Tax On Fertilisers The issue of further reduce tax on fertilisers was placed before the GST council in its 45th and 47th meetings held in September 2021 and June 2022, though the council did not recommend any change in rates. Saturday’s Council meeting will be held after a gap of eight months. The 52nd GST Council meeting took place on October 7, 2023. About the online gaming sector, the council is likely to review the decision to levy 28 per cent GST on the full value of bets for online gaming companies, which came into effect on October 1, 2023. Ranjeet Mahtani, partner, Dhruva Advisors, said, “The plate is full and expectations are that the Council will take up the issues of: rate structure overhauling and rate rationalization on an overall basis, plug the concerns in respect of inverted duty structure (pharmaceuticals, textiles etc.), provide further clarifications on the newly introduced GST on corporate guarantee.” Mahtani added, “A part of the wish list is that the GST Council provides definitive guidance on multiplicity of proceedings by different tax authorities in the GST regime – this has become a bane for industry and is somewhat allayed by the Circular of 30.03.2024. The online gaming sector, which is reeling under the severe impact of modification of the GST rate, anticipates the now delayed review of the sector will be taken up.” In its meetings in July and August, the GST Council had approved amendments to the law to include online gaming, casinos and horse racing as taxable actionable claims, and clarified that such supplies would attract a 28 per cent tax on full bet value. At that time, it was said that a review of the implementation would be carried out after six months. The GST Council is likely to review the decision to levy 28 per cent GST on the full value of bets for online gaming companies that came into effect on October 1, 2023. Following the council decision, over 70 show cause notices have been issued to online gaming companies for alleged GST evasion of over Rs 1.12 lakh crore during financial years 2022-23 and 2023-24. Many of them have gone to court against the notices and the cases are pending. Sources told PTI that the GST Council is likely to discuss the legality of the show cause notices served to online gaming companies and the way forward. About corporate guarantees, the council is also likely to review its last meeting decision to levy 18 per cent GST on guarantees provided by corporates to their subsidiaries. The CBIC circular on corporate guarantee was stayed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court and a review of the legal aspect of the circular is likely to be taken up at the meeting on Saturday. Also, the GST council may set a timeframe for the GoM on rate rationalisation to submit a report. The GoM has been reconstituted twice in the last year and now is headed by Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary. The council is also likely to vet the amendments in the GST law concerning a decision taken in the previous meeting in October last year. The council had decided to give up the right to tax Extra Neutral Alcohol or ENA (raw product for making alcohol for human consumption) to states. Accordingly, ENA used for human consumption will be exempt from Goods and Services Tax (GST), and states can continue to levy VAT. ENA for industrial use will continue to be taxed at 18 per cent under the GST. To bring about this change, an amendment is required in the GST law. Sources also said the GST Council is likely to clarify that telecom companies will have to pay GST, along with the instalments paid towards spectrum charges. The clarification should end confusion among field formations regarding the method for collection of GST in the spectrum auction process. Currently, the GST regime has five broad tax slabs of zero, 5, 12, 18, and 28 per cent. A cess is levied over and above the highest 28 per cent rate on luxury and demerit goods."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Namit Singh Sengar News18.com Last Updated: June 22, 2024, 19:37 IST New Delhi, India FM Nirmala Sitharaman addressing media after GST Council Meeting on June 22 53rd GST Council Meeting: The GST Council on Saturday announced various recommendations relating to taxation, ITC claims and demand notices. GST Council recommended a uniform rate of 12% on all milk cans. Waiver of interest on penalties on tax demand notice was also recommended by the Council. Announcing the decisions of the GST Council, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said, “Council recommended to prescribe a uniform rate of 12% on all milk cans meaning steel, iron, and aluminum which are irrespective of the use. They are called milk cans but wherever they are used that will be the rate applicable so that no disputes arise out of it,” FM said. Services provided by Indian Railways like platform tickets are also exempted from GST. Carton boxes and solar cookers will attract 12% GST. All types of sprinklers, including fire sprinklers will attract a 12% rate. Hostels located outside educational institutions for students are now exempted from the GST, subject to Rs 20,000 per person monthly rent and a stay of a minimum of 90 days. FM also announced the extension of the time limit for GSTR4 till June 30 from FY 2024-25 onwards. The Council also announced the insertion of functionality in GSTR1A for any omission in GSTR1. For 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 for demand notices, interest and penalty will be waived off if tax is paid by March 31, 2025. To reduce litigation, the Council recommended a limit of Rs 20 lakh for the appellate tribunal, Rs 1 crore for the High Court and Rs 2 crore for the Supreme Court for filing of appeal. Abhishek Jain, indirect tax head & partner, KPMG, said, “Interest and penalty waiver for tax demands paid under notices issued under Section 73, is a very pleasing announcement and would go a long way in curtailing unwarranted litigations under GST.” “This would be specifically impactful for litigations which were majorly linked to interpretative issues specifically those for uncertainties involved with implementation of GST. It will be worthwhile to see the nuances of this amnesty specifically their coverage for cases where interest/ penalty has already been paid or taxes paid before issuance of notices.” FM also announced there will be a rollout of biometric authentication pan-India to check fake invoicing in a phased manner. “Pan India implementation of biometric-based registration in a phase-wise manner would help weed out fake registrations and fake credits. This measure would be a nip in the bud by the Government for bogus registration,” Jain added. Union finance minister chaired the 53rd meeting of the GST Council, at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi, today. Along with her, MoS finance Pankaj Chaudhary, CMs of Goa and Meghalaya; Deputy CMs of Bihar, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, and Odisha; besides finance ministers of states & UTs (with legislature) and senior officers from union government & states are attended the meeting. Saturday’s Council meeting was held after a gap of eight months. The 52nd GST Council meeting took place on October 7, 2023.

    "article_content": "Reported By : Mohammad Haris News18.com Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 09:58 IST New Delhi, India Here's a comprehensive guide to determine if you are required to file an ITR this year. (Representative image) Filing income tax returns (ITR) is an annual obligation for many Indian taxpayers. Understanding whether you need to file an ITR for the assessment year (AY) 2024-25 (or financial year 2023-24) can help ensure compliance with the income tax rules. Here’s a comprehensive guide to determine if you are required to file an ITR this year. Income Thresholds The primary criterion for filing an ITR is based on your income level. For AY 2024-25, the income thresholds are as follows: Individuals below 60 years: Total income exceeding Rs 2.5 lakh. Senior citizens (60-80 years): Total income exceeding Rs 3 lakh. Super senior citizens (above 80 years): Total income exceeding Rs 5 lakh. “If your total income before deductions under Sections 80C to 80U surpasses these limits, you must file an ITR,” said a tax practitioner. How to File ITR Online for FY24, A Step-by-Step Guide Types of Income Beyond the basic income thresholds, the need to file an ITR extends to various types of income. It means the following incomes will be considered as your income throughout the year: Salaried Individuals: Income from salary exceeding the specified threshold. Income from House Property: Rent or other income from house property. Capital Gains: Earnings from the sale of property, stocks, mutual funds, etc. Business or Profession: Income from business or professional activities. Other Sources: Income from interest, dividends, winnings from lotteries, etc. Specified Conditions Even if your income is below the threshold, certain conditions necessitate filing an ITR: Deposits in Bank Accounts: For current accounts, deposits exceeding Rs 1 crore in one or more bank accounts. For saving accounts, deposits of Rs 50 lakh or more. Foreign Travel Expenses: Expenditure over Rs 2 lakh on foreign travel. Electricity Bills: Payments exceeding Rs 1 lakh on electricity bills. Additionally, if you have foreign assets or income, or hold signing authority in any account outside India, you must file an ITR regardless of your income level. Investment Gains and Losses Investors in stocks, mutual funds, or other securities need to file an ITR if: Capital Gains: You earned short-term or long-term capital gains. Dividends: You received dividends, even if tax-free up to Rs 10 lakh. Reporting investment losses is also crucial as it allows you to carry forward losses to offset future gains, reducing your tax liability in subsequent years. Claiming Refunds If you have paid excess tax through Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) or advance tax, filing an ITR is necessary to claim a refund. Without filing, you cannot reclaim the excess tax paid. Mandatory Filers Certain categories of individuals and entities are mandatorily required to file an ITR, regardless of income level: Companies and Firms: All companies and firms, irrespective of income or loss. Charitable Trusts and Religious Institutions: If they are claiming exemption under Section 10. What Happens If You Do Not File ITR? Failing to file an ITR can lead to penalties and prosecution: Late Filing Fees: A penalty of Rs 5,000 if filed after the due date but before December 31 of the assessment year. If filed later, the penalty increases. Interest on Tax Due: Interest on the amount due, calculated monthly from the due date. Prosecution: In severe cases, non-compliance can lead to prosecution, with imprisonment ranging from three months to two years, and a fine."

(Representative image) A recent research study conducted by Navi Mutual Fund among mutual fund investors and non-investors (Millenial and Gen Z) revealed some interesting insights into their decision-making and potential knowledge gaps. The study underscored the importance of greater financial literacy and dispelling misconceptions in empowering young adults to make informed investment decisions. Also Read: Here’s Why You Should Invest In Flexi-cap Mutual Funds; Check Top 5 Reasons The survey was conducted with 700 individuals. Some key findings from the study are highlighted below. Top Priority = Returns Returns are the top priority for 1 out of 2 investors in selecting a fund. This is applicable for both active and index funds. Low Understanding of Index Funds 1 out of 3 index fund investors do not fully understand the concept of index funds. As per the study, index funds are preferred owing to lower fees and positive experiences from friends and family. Over-reliance on social networks & “fin-fluencers” 80% of investors rely on their social networks and “fin-fluencers” for investment information, which can be a risky affair. Some key misconceptions from the study are highlighted below. Misconception 1: MF Investing Requires Extensive Financial Knowledge According to the survey, over 60% of respondents believe that mutual fund investment requires extensive financial knowledge, which deters potential investors. Misconception 2: Large Lump Sum Needed to Start Investing The myth that a large lump sum is required to start investing discourages 1 out of every 3 potential investors even though many mutual funds allow investments with limited initial capital. Misconception 3: Investment Not Secure if Investment App Shuts Down Nearly 50% of non-users fear their investments are not secure if the investment app shuts down. The findings from Navi’s study highlighted the need for more financial literacy initiatives to empower investors. The survey suggested that mutual fund houses can develop and provide user-friendly educational resources and tools that simplify the concept of mutual funds and the investment process while dispelling common misconceptions. Access to such credible and trusted resources can significantly reduce the deterrents for young investors, allowing them to make more informed investment decisions."

LIC Lapsed Policy Revival: Reviving a lapsed Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) life insurance policy is crucial to maintaining the benefits of your policy. The procedure may vary depending on the specific policy and the terms and conditions in your policy document. It is important to adhere closely to LIC’s guidelines and instructions during the revival process. How To Revive A Lapsed LIC Policy? If your policy has lapsed due to non-payment of premiums by the due date, the terms and conditions of the policy contract become void until you revive the policy. To revive a lapsed policy, you must pay the accumulated premiums with interest and meet any necessary health requirements. Concessions for claims during the lapsed period: 1. If the policyholder has paid premiums for at least three full years and then stops paying, and if the life assured dies within six months from the due date of the first unpaid premium, the full policy amount will be paid after deducting the unpaid premiums with interest up to the date of death. 2. If the policyholder has paid premiums for at least five full years and then stops paying, and if the life assured dies within 12 months from the due date of the first unpaid premium, the full policy amount will be paid after deducting the unpaid premiums with interest up to the date of death. Revivals: If premiums are not paid within the grace period specified, the policy will lapse. For policies paid yearly, half-yearly, or quarterly, a grace period of one month or at least 30 days is permitted. For monthly payments, the grace period is 15 days. During this grace period, if death occurs, the full sum assured is payable. A lapsed policy can be revived according to the terms of the plan. This requires submitting proof of continued insurability to LIC’s satisfaction and paying all overdue premiums along with interest at rates set by LIC. LIC’s official website states that LIC reserves the right to either accept the revival of a discontinued policy at original terms, accept it with modified terms, or decline the revival altogether. Approval from LIC is necessary for the revival of any discontinued policy to take effect. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you revive a lapsed LIC policy: Once your policy is revived, ensure that you continue to pay your premiums regularly to keep the policy in force and maintain its benefits."

    "article_content": "Written By : Sarvjeet.Singh Virk Edited By: Namit Singh Sengar News18.com Last Updated: June 19, 2024, 11:08 IST New Delhi, India While SIPs offer consistency, periodic adjustments can be highly beneficial (Representative image) SIPs are a popular investment tool for building long-term wealth. They offer discipline and consistency, allowing you to invest a fixed amount regularly. But what if you set your SIP amount and forget it? While SIPs offer a path to long-term wealth building, a static approach can be detrimental in the face of two crucial forces: inflation and income growth. Here’s why actively adjusting your SIPs is a cornerstone of a successful investment strategy. Inflation: The Silent Value Eroder Inflation, the gradual rise in the cost of living, is a constant threat to your purchasing power. Imagine your current SIP allows you to invest in a specific investment basket. Over time, due to inflation, that same basket will require a larger sum. A stagnant SIP amount essentially lets inflation chip away at the value of your investments, hindering your ability to achieve your long-term goals. By strategically increasing your SIP contributions in line with inflation forecasts, you ensure your investment grows alongside the cost of living, preserving your purchasing power. Growth as an Investment Opportunity As your career progresses and your income rises, neglecting to adjust your SIPs means missing out on valuable investment opportunities. Maintaining a fixed SIP amount despite a higher income translates to a lower investment ratio. From a wealth management perspective, this is a missed chance to capitalise on compounding. Compounding is the magic formula where your returns generate additional returns over time. By increasing your SIPs proportionally to your income growth, you fuel the compounding engine, accelerating wealth accumulation and propelling you toward your financial goals faster. Reaching Your Financial Milestones Many financial goals, such as retirement planning, child education, or a dream home, have a specific cost attached. These costs, unfortunately, are not immune to inflation. A house you aim to buy in 10 years will likely cost considerably more by then. Regularly adjusting your SIPs for inflation ensures your investment corpus grows alongside the rising cost of your goals. This proactive approach significantly increases the likelihood of achieving your financial milestones comfortably. Maximising the Power of Compounding Regular SIP increases unlock the true power of compounding. Imagine a snowball rolling downhill – the larger the initial snowball (your investment), the faster it grows with each roll (compounding returns). By increasing your SIP contributions, you’re essentially adding more snow to the ball, leading to exponential growth in your investment corpus over the long term. This snowball effect becomes particularly impactful in the later stages of your investment journey, significantly boosting your overall wealth accumulation. Market Dynamics and Strategic Adjustments Market conditions are dynamic, and a truly effective investment strategy requires flexibility. While SIPs offer consistency, periodic adjustments can be highly beneficial. For example, during market downturns, consider increasing your SIP to buy more units at lower prices, potentially amplifying your long-term returns. Conversely, if the market reaches new highs, you might adjust your SIP amount to maintain your risk tolerance. -The author is co-founder & MD, Shoonya by Finvasia. Views expressed are personal."

Unit-linked or index-linked insurance products shall not be advertised as ‘investment products’, IRDAI said in a master circular dated June 19. Insurers will have to specifically state that market-linked insurance plans are different from traditional endowment policies and carry risks. Likewise, participating (with bonus) endowment policies will have to state upfront that the bonuses projected in benefit illustrations are not guaranteed. All the advertisements of linked insurance products and annuity products with variable annuity payout option shall disclose the risk factors, it said. “All insurers shall advertise the launch of unit-linked funds or index-linked funds under existing insurance products or new insurance products, only with reference to the underlying life insurance coverage and the products associated with it. Further, no press release or statement shall be issued by the insurer without making a reference to the life insurance coverage and the associated products,” the master circular said.

(Representative image) Transferring your Provident Fund (PF) from an exempted trust to the Employees’ Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) involves several steps. When a member moves from one establishment to another, their accounts must be transferred. This process involves transferring the PF accumulations to the new account, along with the service details necessary for pension purposes. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you through the process: Transfer PF From Trust To EPFO Online To file an Online Transfer Claim Application , an EPF member must be registered on the Member Portal. There are certain prerequisites for applying online, such as the availability of member IDs in the EPFO database and the registration of the employer’s authorised signatories’ digital signatures. Members should check their eligibility for filing an Online Transfer Claim through the EPFO website at www.epfindia.gov.in by navigating to For Employees > Online Transfer Claim Portal (OTCP) > Check eligibility to file Online Transfer Claim. Steps to Transfer PF from Exempted Trust to EPFO Verify Your UAN Details: Ensure your Universal Account Number (UAN) is active and linked to your Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details. Obtain the Previous PF Account Details: Gather your previous PF account details from the exempted trust. This will include your PF account number, the trust’s name, and other relevant information. Submit Form 13: Online Submission Offline Submission The portal provides a detailed process flow for registration on the Member Portal and for filing online claims to assist EPF members. It is recommended that members review this process before filling out the online claim application. Things To Note Members have the option to get their claim form attested by either the present or previous employer. However, if the present establishment is exempted, the member must submit the claim through the present employer, as the bank account number and IFS code of the exempted trust are required to transfer the PF accumulations to the trust’s bank account. If the previous account was maintained by a PF Trust of an exempted establishment, the member should submit a physical transfer claim form (Form 13) to the Trust while also submitting an online transfer claim form (Form 13) to the PF office to transfer the service details under the Pension Fund to the new account. The physical transfer claim form (Form 13) can be printed from the data entered by the member while filing the online claim on the Portal. After submitting the online claim application, the member must print, sign, and submit it to the employer (either previous or present, depending on the option chosen) to complete the process. Once you submit the completed form, your previous employer will verify the details and approve the transfer request. After approval, your employer will initiate the transfer process by sending the form and your PF balance to the EPFO. The exempted trust will process the request and transfer the accumulated PF amount to the EPFO. They may also provide a statement of the account, indicating the transferred amount. Once the transfer is complete, you will receive a notification via SMS on your registered mobile number. You can also verify the transferred amount by checking your passbook on the EPFO portal. You can track the transfer status through the EPFO website using your UAN."

    "article_content": "Edited By: Aparna Deb Trending Desk Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 14:00 IST New Delhi, India CAGR refers to the average annualised rate at which the value of an investment (stocks, funds etc.) changes over time. The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is a parameter used to calculate the annualised growth rate of an investment or metric during a specific period. It’s one of the most convenient methods for determining returns on individual assets, investment portfolios, and anything else that can rise or decline in value over time. CAGR is essential for evaluating investment opportunities and the past performance of an investment. It enables you to compare various investments consistently and make accurate decisions. How to calculate the Compound annual growth rate? Here’s the formula: CAGR = (Ending value/beginning value) ^ (1/No. of periods) -1 *Ending value is the value of investment at the end of the investment period. *Beginning value is the value of investment at the beginning of the investment period *The number of periods is the time for how many years you’ve invested. Important things investors must know about CAGR: CAGR refers to the average annualised rate at which the value of an investment (stocks, funds etc.) changes over time. If the price of a stock rises from Rs 200 to Rs 242 in two years, its CAGR will be 10 per cent. However, the annual rate of growth will vary between financial periods due to market volatility. Thus, the stock price doesn’t have to move from Rs 200 to Rs 242 at a constant speed. It might have risen to Rs 280-320 in the first year and then fallen to Rs 242. The annual rate of growth will vary between financial periods due to market volatility. Given the starting and ending values, its CAGR will remain at 10% per year. As a result, CAGR could cover up turbulent conditions in the interim and give a picture of consistent growth. Instead of believing that the rate will remain constant every year, investors who use advertised CAGR should also take risk factors into account. It’s important to understand that CAGR is less reliable for short investment periods. CAGR provides accurate estimates of the annualised rate of growth for investments. When calculating, it is preferable to utilise longer periods to ensure accurate results."

(Representative image) Zero depreciation cover is also known as the NIL depreciation cover. It is an add-on that ensures the policyholder can claim the full amount under their comprehensive auto insurance policy and is exempt from paying the depreciation value of the damaged or replaced items. In the case of motor insurance, depreciation refers to the decline in the value of a vehicle due to various factors such as ageing, malfunction or some other issue. In general, all vehicles are depreciating assets, a new car will be of higher value as compared to an old one. With an insurance policy without zero depreciation cover, the policyholder may not get the full amount of the part replacement as insurers only pay for the replaced parts after deducting the depreciation amount. The insured has to pay for the remaining amount. In such cases, choosing Zero Depreciation for car insurance could be a better option as it allows the insured person to get the maximum reimbursement during the time of claim process. Benefits of having Zero Depreciation cover: The add-on coverage benefits luxury car owners by lowering the cost of repairs or replacements of expensive parts. For people living in places with a high risk of accidents, having this insurance protects the customers from high expenses during the repairs. Owners of new vehicles must add zero depreciation cover, as it will help to maintain the value of their car even after an accident. In regions that frequently experience flooding and severe rain, cars are vulnerable to water damage. In these kinds of weather, zero depreciation coverage is helpful. New drivers are more prone to accidents. Having Zero depreciation cover could help reduce the financial burden if a collision happens. It brings mental peace: You don’t have to worry about the expenses if anything happens to your vehicle Factors to consider before opting for Zero Depreciation cover: Age of the vehicle: The older your vehicle, the higher the Zero depreciation cover will cost. This add-on applies to cars under the age limit of 3 years and is not advisable to pay high premiums for a car older than three years. Only a certain number of claims can be made under the Zero depreciation cover. This is to prevent customers from filing claims for minor dents in their cars. Check the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) rate of depreciation for every part. In case, a user makes a claim using a basic insurance policy, as per IRDAI, on Nylon, Plastic parts and batteries – 50 per cent depreciation will be deducted. For fibreglass components, 30 per cent depreciation will be deducted. Fuel type: The premium of a zero depreciation cover varies based on the vehicle’s fuel type i.e. Petrol, Diesel, CNG or Electric."

Nirmala Sitharaman was born in Madurai on August 18, 1959, to Narayan Sitharaman (who worked in the Railways) and Savitri (a homemaker). She studied economics at Tiruchirapalli’s Seethalakshmi Ramaswami College. She then moved to Delhi to pursue her Master’s and Master of Philosophy in Economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). But before the veteran politician forayed into politics, she was part of the corporate world in the United Kingdom. Nirmala Sitharaman’s political career started in 2008 when she joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (she returned to India in the early 1990s). In two years, she became the party’s second female spokesperson after Sushma Swaraj. As the Union finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman has so far tabled six budgets. This includes the February 1 Interim Budget. She became the second finance minister to present her sixth straight budget after equaling her record with former PM Morarji Desai. Steering away from the traditional leather briefcase, the 64-year-old Union Minister opted for a digital tablet wrapped in a traditional ‘bahi-khata’ style pouch."

With his NDA alliance winning by a narrower margin than anticipated, the landscape of Indian equities is poised for some adjustments. Concerns regarding the potential impact of social programs on economic growth may arise. However, we are optimistic that the current government can strike a balance between these priorities. Also Read: Here’s Top Priority of Investors When Selecting A Mutual Fund, Report Reveals Common Myths Against this interesting backdrop, Indian retail investors must adopt well-informed strategies to navigate this period of post-election volatility effectively. Impact of Election Outcomes on Financial Markets Election outcomes often lead to volatility in financial markets. The Modi administration’s re-election, albeit with a smaller majority, did introduce a degree of uncertainty initially. This volatility was evident in the sharp movements seen in major indices like the NSE Nifty 50 and the S&P BSE Sensex, which surged following initial exit poll predictions but later adjusted as actual results emerged. Practical Strategies for Investors Given the current market dynamics, retail investors can employ several strategies to adapt and thrive: Despite recent market adjustments, the outlook remains optimistic. There are no significant bubbles in the Indian banking, corporate, or housing sectors. The election-induced market correction has likely reduced market leverage, contributing to a more sustainable growth path. Additionally, India’s strong macroeconomic fundamentals – including growth prospects, inflation control, and fiscal progress – provide a solid foundation for continued market optimism. Final takeaways In conclusion, navigating the post-election market requires a strategic approach rooted in valuation focus, sectoral diversification, historical perspective, long-term growth investment, and prudent risk management. As India continues on its growth trajectory under PM Modi’s leadership, investors can capitalise on the opportunities presented by a stabilising market. By adopting these strategies, retail investors can not only weather the post-election volatility but also position themselves for future gains in the evolving economic landscape. -The author is Chairman and Managing Director of Inventure Growth and Securities.

The brokerage noted that all the macro and micro factors are currently aligned for India’s internet stocks. As the dispersion in the stock returns rises, there is heightened focus on being stock specific and selecting stocks carefully. The way to select stocks is to take into account the operating environment, track record, outlook and valuation. Based on this, Morgan Stanley favours Zomato and PB Fintech in the internet space, since they are outperforming other internet players Global brokerage Morgan Stanley retained its ‘overweight’ rating on the counter with a target of Rs 235. The set target implies a probable upside of over 21 per cent. The brokerage said Zepto raising funding round increases the relevance of Quick Commerce (QC) channel. On Friday, the company announced that it has raised $665 million in a funding round that has doubled its valuations to $3.6 billion. This fundraise marked the biggest financing this year in the QC segment. Morgan Stanley said there is a probability that the competitive intensity may increase in the segment over the near term. It noted that assuming competitive intensity increases further, a push out of profitability for Quick commerce business versus the current assumptions is possible. Of late, stock of the food delivery services firm has been in focus after global brokerage have turned bullish on the counter post its confirmation on initial talks with Paytm to acquire its ticketing business. Over the past year, Zomato shares have skyrocketed 160 per cent in trade as compared to a 25 per cent rise in the frontline index Nifty 50 during the same time."

On Saturday, a meeting was held between the CCPA (Central Consumer Protection Authority) and the electronic appliance manufacturing companies. It was done to discuss the issue regarding the warranty period of a device, after its purchase instead of the installation date. According to the chief commissioner of CCPA Nidhi Khare, the consumers are to be informed clearly about the warranty period of their devices immediately after the purchase. They should have all the knowledge on the warranty while buying the product and the companies have to ensure this is followed. Nidhi Khare said in a statement, “Consumer grievances relating to the warranty period must be addressed in a proactive and prompt manner.” As per reports, the meeting was attended by prominent electronic companies like LG, Panasonic, Haier, Croma, Bosch and others. Furthermore, the CCPA stated, “Since the warranty period as per the policies set by manufacturers commences from the purchase date, and not the date of installation, there is a shortfall in the warranty period as consumers can only begin using the product after it has been installed on their premises.” More reports state that the issue was discussed for two categories of electronic devices. The first is the “plug and play” products like iron press and microwave, which do not require an installation. The second category includes appliances like refrigerators and air conditioners, that need to be installed. The meeting mentioned the right of a consumer on the product that they have purchased. According to those rights, as defined under Section 2(9) of the Act, a consumer has the right to be knowledgeable on the quality, quantity and price of a product, goods or services. It aims to provide the utmost protection to a consumer from unfair trade practices. In the meeting, the feasibility of the installation date to be the commencement date for the warranty period was also discussed. Measures to prevent the exploitation of the process were also discussed. The electronic appliance makers have been asked to give their opinions in 15 days."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Business Desk Local News Desk Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 12:45 IST Delhi, India SBI has taken this step as a part of its network expansion plan. State Bank of India (SBI) is one of the largest banks and lenders in India. It is set to expand its network by opening 400 new branches across India in the current financial year. SBI has taken this step as a part of its network expansion plan, where it has opened 137 branches in the last financial year. Out of these, it opened 59 new rural branches. In a media interview, Dinesh Kumar Khara, SBI Chairman said, “Somebody asked me if 89 percent of digital and 98 percent transactions were happening outside the branch, whether the branch is required anymore. My answer is yes. It is still required because there are newer areas which are emerging. He further added that banks remain important for offering many services like advisory and wealth management, which are best delivered in person. The bank will be identifying locations where the opportunity exists and in those locations, they will open those branches. They plan to add almost 400 branches this year. As of March 2024, SBI has a network of 22,542 branches across India. The chairman further opened up about monetising subsidiaries and said that the bank wants to further scale the operations before listing them. Scaling would result in increased valuation and may yield better results for SBI. Among the subsidiaries being considered for the public listing are SBI General Insurance and SBI Payment Services. During the fiscal year that ended in March 2024, SBI infused an additional capital of Rs 489.67 crore into SBI General Insurance Company Ltd. It has also introduced Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) and decreased the bank’s stake from 69.95 percent to 69.11 percent. SBI General Insurance Company Ltd registered a 30.4 percent increase in net profit which reached Rs 240 crore for the financial year which ended in March 2024. This was 56 crore more than the previous year. SBI Payments is one of the largest acquirers in the country and has more than 33.10 lakh merchant payment acceptance touchpoints. The company witnessed a decline in its net profit to Rs 144.36 crore against 159.34 crore from the previous year."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Business Desk News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 12:52 IST New Delhi, India Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani. Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani addressed the Hindenburg incident during the 32nd annual general meeting of the conglomerate, dismissing the short-seller’s over 100-pages report as “baseless accusations”. “It was a two-sided attack — a vague criticism of our financial standing and, at the same time, an information distortion campaign, dragging us into a political battlefield. The attack was a calculated strike two days before the closing of our follow-on public offer,” said Adani about the US short seller’s scathing report against the conglomerate last year. Hindenburg Case Hindenburg’s report accused the Adani Group of stock manipulation and misuse of tax havens, causing a significant sell-off in the conglomerate. However, a Supreme Court-appointed expert panel later found no conclusive evidence of stock manipulation. The panel did, however, suggest regulatory improvements to protect investors. Adani criticised certain media segments for amplifying the attack, aiming to tarnish the group’s reputation and erode market value. “Amplified by a segment of vested media, it was designed to defame us, do maximum damage and erode our hard-earned market value,” he added. Despite these challenges, Adani emphasised the group’s resilience, noting that they raised an additional Rs 40,000 crore to cover two years of debt repayment and pre-paid Rs 17,500 crore in margin-linked financing. This improved the group’s net debt to EBITDA ratio from 3.3 to 2.2. Strong Financial Backing Adani highlighted the group’s commitment to operational excellence and transparency, validated by rating agencies, the financial community, and respected global investors such as GQG Partners, TotalEnergies, IHC, QIA, and the US Development Finance Corporation. “Our commitment to operational excellence and transparent disclosures was validated not only by rating agencies and the well-informed financial community, but also by respected global investors,” Adani affirmed. Optimism for India’s Growth The Adani Group is optimistic about India’s domestic growth, buoyed by the government’s increased infrastructure spending, which has risen by 16 per cent to over Rs 11 lakh crore for the current financial year. Adani emphasized the crucial role of state governments in implementing infrastructure initiatives. “Given the multiplier effect, the government of India has rightly focused on infrastructure development by raising its funding by 16 per cent to over Rs 11 lakh crore for this financial year. It is worthwhile to note that annual spending has tripled in the last 5 years,” Adani remarked. Future Plans and Segment Updates Adani outlined the conglomerate’s ambitious plans, including developing 30 GW of capacity in the next five years—enough to power nations like Belgium and Switzerland. Adani Green Energy has revised its FY 2029-30 target from 45 GW to 50 GW, adding 2.8 GW this year alone, representing 15% of India’s total renewable capacity addition. Passenger traffic at Adani-operated airports reached 88.6 million, and the group’s cement ambitions aim for a combined capacity of 140 million tonnes per annum by 2028. Notably, Ambuja Cements was the lead supplier for India’s longest sea bridge, the 21.9 km Mumbai trans harbour link. For Adani Energy Solutions, the transmission order book stands at ₹17,000 crore, with an expanded smart metering order book of 228 lakh units. Adani Energy Solutions’ transmission order book stands at Rs 17,000 crore, and our smart metering order book has expanded to 228 lakh units."

(Representative image) The finance ministry has reportedly called a meeting of heads of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) on Tuesday to review the progress of various financial inclusion schemes, including PM Vishwakarma, Jan Suraksha and Mudra Yojana. The gathering will evaluate the progress of key schemes like PM Vishwakarma, StandUp India, PM SVANidhi and others, as per sources cited by news agency PTI. Financial Services Secretary Vivek Joshi is set to chair the meeting. Other financial inclusion-related issues will also be discussed in the meeting. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September last year launched the PM Vishwakarma scheme under which traditional craftsmen and artisans will be provided loan assistance at a minimal interest rate without the need for collateral. With a financial outlay of Rs 13,000 crore for five years, the scheme will benefit about 30 lakh families of traditional artisans and craftsmen, including weavers, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, laundry workers, and barbers. Besides, sources said, targets for PM Jan Dhan Yojana would be reviewed. The status of inoperative accounts under PMJDY and issuance of RuPay cards will also be reviewed, sources told the news agency. Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) offers life insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh, in case of death due to any reason, to people in the age group of 18-50 years having a bank or post office account, who give their consent to join or enable auto-debit of premium. On the other hand, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) offers insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh for accidental death or total permanent disability and Rs 1 lakh for partial permanent disability to people in the age group of 18-70 years with a bank or post office account, who give their consent to join or enable auto-debit of premium. To promote entrepreneurship at the grassroots level, banks have sanctioned more than Rs 40,700 crore to over 1.80 lakh beneficiaries under the StandUp India scheme in seven years. StandUp India, launched on April 5, 2016, with a focus on economic empowerment and job creation, has been extended up to 2025. The scheme aims to encourage all bank branches to extend loans to borrowers belonging to SC, ST and women categories in setting up their greenfield enterprises. Last year, the government approved the continuation of Prime Minister Street Vendor’s AtmaNirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) Scheme till December 2024. The scheme was launched in June 2020 by the government as a micro-credit facility to empower street vendors to recover losses incurred as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Through PM SVANidhi, affordable collateral-free loans are given to street vendors. (With PTI inputs)"

Quant Mutual Fund said in a statement to its investors it is responding to queries received from Sebi, without specifying the nature of the enquiries. Moneycontrol had reported on Sunday that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) was investigating allegations of “front running” – or dealing on price-sensitive information before its general release – at the mutual fund. “We will provide all necessary support and continue to furnish data to SEBI on a regular and as-needed basis,” the fund said in its statement. The statement also said, “With over 8 million folios and an asset under management (AUM) of Rs 93,000 crore, our commitment to maintaining investor confidence remains steadfast. We appreciate the trust and support of our investors, and our advanced research capabilities and analytical tools will continue to keep our investors ahead of the curve.” Reportedly, the market regulator conducted search and seizure operations on Quant Mutual Fund, owned by Sandeep Tandon, due to suspicions of front-running activities. Sources indicated that the operations occurred on Friday and Saturday, targeting locations in Delhi, Mumbai, and Hyderabad. Sebi’s investigation wing executed the search following a detailed probe into front-running allegations. Quant Mutual Fund had been under Sebi’s surveillance for an extended period, with the investigation involving extensive inquiries by the regulator. What Is Front-running? Front-running is an unethical practice in the financial markets where a broker or trader takes advantage of advanced knowledge of pending orders from their clients. Specifically, it involves executing orders on a security for their account ahead of the client’s order to profit from the expected price movement."

The BSE Sensex was trading 0.17 per cent or 128 points higher at 77,337.77 levels. NSE’s Nifty50, on the other hand, rose 0.52 per cent or 27 points to 23,527.70 levels.

Similarly, on NSE, Sun Pharma, M&M were the top gainers while IndusInd Bank, Cipla were the top laggards. Broader markets also made a recovery. Nifty SmallCap rose 0.06 per cent while MidCap soared 0.18 per cent. Sectorally, Nifty Auto, Pharma and FMCG were trading higher at 0.44 per cent, 0.39 per cent and 0.53 per cent, respectively. Media, meanwhile, fell the most (down over 1 per cent). Market View: Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. The consolidation phase in the market is likely to continue. The near-term strength in the market is likely to come from Bank Nifty assisted by institutional buying notably from FIIs who have turned buyers last week. However, SEBI investigation in the Quant Mutual Fund is a slight sentiment negative for the market.The sectoral churn happening in the market might accelerate since profit booking is happening in some overvalued sectors and money is flowing into fairly valued largecaps. There is a likelihood of the rupee turning stable with a positive upward bias in the near term on expectations of big debt inflows after the inclusion of India in the Global Bond EM Index later this month. This can act as a trigger for more FII inflows into equity, going forward. Global Cues Asian shares were quiet on Monday as investors awaited US price data, anticipating signs of easing inflation. Meanwhile, markets were attentive to potential Japanese intervention as the dollar approached the 160 yen threshold. Geopolitical tensions were also prominent, with the upcoming US presidential debate on Thursday and the first round of voting in the French election over the weekend."

Bharti Airtel had bought 1 per cent additional stake in Indus Towers in the transaction, taking its holding in the towers company to nearly 49 percent. The proposed additional stake acquisition would make Bharti Airtel the majority stakeholder in Indus Towers, taking it past 50 per cent mark. Airtel plans to Indus Towers with its data centre business Nxtra, reported CNBC TV18. The merger would unlock value, and would also give exit to Carlyle from its investment.

(PTI/File) Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Bihar are the four biggest states in India in terms of Lok Sabha seats, accounting for 210 constituencies. In the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections, just 25% seats – 53 parliamentary constituencies – saw improved voter turnout, while on the remaining seats, the voter turnout dropped compared to 2019. Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of Lok Sabha seats at 80, followed by 48 in Maharashtra and 42 in West Bengal. Bihar is the fourth biggest state in this respect with 40 Lok Sabha seats. Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal witnessed Lok Sabha polls in seven phases while Maharashtra voted in five phases. An analysis of these 210 seats by News18 also showed that on just 64 of these seats, the women turnout was higher than 2019, while on 146, the women turnout was lower than the last time. The analysis of the data from the Election Commission of India shows that in more than half – 110 seats – the elected party did not change from 2019. Of these 110 seats, 22 saw improved voter turnout, while in the remaining 88 the voter turnout dropped. Similarly, in the 100 seats where the elected party changed in 2024 when compared to 2019, 17 saw improved turnout, while 69 witnessed a drop from the last elections. In West Bengal, across all 42 seats, the voter turnout was less than that in 2019. In 31 seats, the elected party remained unchanged from 2019, while in 11, it was replaced with a new party. The Trinamool Congress won 22 seats in 2019 and improved its tally to 29 in 2024. The BJP, which won 18 seats in 2019, bagged 12 in 2024. The Congress stood third in both elections. Down from two seats in the last elections, the grand old party won just one constituency in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Maldaha Uttar, Alipurduars, Darjeeling, Balurghat, and Maldaha Dakshin were the seats that reported the highest drop in voter turnout. All these have stayed with the respective parties they elected in 2019. Two seats in the state capital – Kolkata Dakshin (66.95%) and Kolkata Uttar (63.59%) – recorded lowest voter turnouts and were the only two seats with less than 70% voter turnout. Across 16 Lok Sabha seats in the state, the turnout this time was between 70% and 80%, while 24 other seats recorded turnouts more than 80%. Compared to the average turnout of 81.67% in 2019, the state reported 79.19% this time. Women turnout across 40 seats in the state witnessed a drop. Tamluk and Kanthi were the only seats that recorded marginal improvement in women turnout. More than half – 27 seats – in Maharashtra saw higher voter turnout than 2019. In nine of these seats, the winning party remained the same. Further, of these 27 seats, 25 constituencies also saw higher women turnout than 2019. In 35 seats, the winning party had changed this time from 2019. The actual picture, though, is a much more complex affair. This was the first election in Maharashtra since two of the major state-level parties – Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena – were split into two factions. The rebel faction, in both cases, got the status and symbol of the original party. Nationalist Congress Party-Sharadchandra Pawar got eight seats. Two of these were bagged by the undivided NCP in 2019, while six were with the BJP. In 2019, the united NCP won four seats. This time, the NCP got only one seat that it bagged in 2019 – Raigad. The Shiv Sena won seven seats this time, six of these bagged by the undivided party in 2019 and one of these won by AIMIM in the last election. The Shiv Sena-Uddhav Balasaheb Thackrey won nine seats – eight bagged by the undivided party in 2019 and one from the then ally BJP. In Uttar Pradesh, out of the 80 seats that witnessed Lok Sabha polls in seven phases, only seven seats saw higher voter turnout than 2019. All these seats – Mainpuri, Rae Bareli, Kanpur, Kaiserganj, Farrukhabad, Phulpur, and Baharaich — have re-elected the same party from 2019. On 73 seats, the voter turnout in 2024 was lower than in 2019. The seats that witnessed sharp drop in voter turnout were — Mathura, Muzaffarnagar and Baghpat. On 19 seats, the women turnout in 2024 was higher than 2019. The highest jump reported in Barabanki and Raebareli, both of which voted for the Congress. Mathura and Muzaffarnagar reported the highest drop in women turnout. In Uttar Pradesh, in three seats, the voter turnout was less than 50% – Phulpur, Mathura and Ghaziabad. None of the Lok Sabha seats in UP reported voter turnout above 70%. Barabanki, Saharanpur and Kheri were the three seats with the highest voter turnout. In 2019, two seats in the state saw turnouts above 70% and only one had turnout below 50%. In 2019, the average voter turnout of the state was 59.30%, but dropped to 57.04% in 2024, analysis shows. In Bihar, the situation was no better. Only six seats in the state saw higher voter turnout than 2019. When compared to 2019, across 31 seats in Bihar, the same party or its allies were elected in 2024. On nine seats, the winning party changed from 2019. All these nine seats were with the BJP or the JD(U) in 2019. In three seats, the winning party changed, although the seat remained with the alliance party. The average voter turnout in Bihar this time was 56.33%, down from 57.53% recorded in 2019. In majority of the states, the voter turnout this time was lower than in 2019, despite EC’s efforts to improve the participation of the public in elections. The average voter turnout across the country was 65.79%, down from 67.4% in 2019."

    "article_content": "PTI Last Updated: June 22, 2024, 14:05 IST New Delhi, India 'This law was needed but it deals with question paper leaks and other irregularities after they have occurred,' Ramesh said. (PTI File) The Centre’s decision now to implement a law to prevent the use of unfair means in competitive examinations after several “scams” have taken place, including in the NEET-UG and the UGC-NET tests, is “damage control”, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh claimed on Saturday. This law was needed but it deals with question paper leaks and other irregularities after they have occurred, he claimed in a post on X. Several opposition political parties and student associations, including the Congress, have held protests across the country over alleged irregularities in medical entrance exams NEET-UG and the UGC-NET. Amid the raging row over the issue, the Centre on Friday operationalised the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024, which aims to curb malpractices and irregularities in competitive examinations and entails provisions for a maximum jail term of 10 years and a fine of up to Rs 1 crore for offenders. The Bill received the President’s assent on February 13, but was enforced only on Friday, Ramesh, the Congress’ general secretary communications, said. “On February 13, 2024, the President of India gave her assent to the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means), Bill, 2024. Finally, just this morning the nation has been told that this Act has come into force from yesterday, that is June 21, 2024,” he said. “This is damage control to deal with the NEET, UGC-NET, CSIR-UGC-NET and other scams,” the Congress leader said and added that “This law was needed. But it deals with leaks after they have occurred.” “More important are laws, systems, processes, and procedures to ensure that leaks don’t happen in the first place,” he said. The National Testing Agency, which conducts the competitive exams, on Friday, announced the postponement of the June edition of the Joint Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and University Grants Commission National Eligibility Test, citing unavoidable circumstances and logistic issues. It came two days after the agency cancelled the UGC-NET examination within 24 hours of its conduct saying the integrity of the exam had been compromised, and a massive row on NEET over alleged irregularities, with the issue now before the Supreme Court."

(File image: PTI) The Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress have been in a war of words over the appointment of BJP leader and seven-time MP Bhartruhari Mahtab as pro tem speaker, a post active only for the first days of a new Parliament. The 18th Lok Sabha will be convened on Monday. The Congress, which was expecting its senior MP K Suresh to be appointed to the post, was irked. Senior leader KC Venugopal called it “an attempt to destroy democratic and parliamentary norms…” Pro tem speaker is a temporary presiding officer of the Lok Sabha appointed by the President of India to administer oath of office to newly elected members and preside over the election of the Speaker of the House. The system of appointing a pro tem speaker in India is adopted from the ‘Father of the House’ convention in the UK’s Westminster system of parliament which states that this title is bestowed on the member who has the longest unbroken service in the parliament and this member will be responsible for presiding over the House until the Speaker is elected. By that convention, BJP sources pointed out, Bhartruhari Mahtab who has served seven consecutive terms as Lok Sabha MP qualifies for the post of pro tem speaker and has been appointed as such. This allegation of the Congress clearly falls flat, they said, as Suresh Kodukkunil has only served 8 nonconsecutive terms, having lost in 1998 and 2004. This means that this is only his 4th consecutive term as Lok Sabha MP, thus not qualifying him for the post of pro tem speaker. In the 17th Lok Sabha too, the same convention was followed with Virendra Kumar being appointed as pro tem speaker by the President as he was the longest-serving consecutively elected member of the parliament then. Maneka Gandhi who was the senior-most MP but in non-consecutive terms was not selected as pro tem speaker accordingly. The Congress also further accused the government of breaching parliamentary norms and insulting the Constitution by appointing Mahtab as pro tem speaker. BJP sources pointed out that in 2004, the Congress “breached” these parliamentary norms as it recommended to the President to appoint Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, who was serving his 8th term as MP, as pro tem speaker of the house for the election of Speaker. This was despite the fact that there were more senior members like Atal Bihari Vajpayee and George Fernandes who were serving their 10th and 9th terms, respectively. There have been many previous instances where the convention of appointing the senior-most MP as pro tem speaker was not followed. In 1956, Sardar Hukam Singh was appointed to the post even though he was not the senior-most MP. In 1977 too, DN Tiwari was appointed as pro tem speaker even though he was not the senior-most member of the House. In 2018, hearing a case filed by the Congress that the appointment of a particular MLA as pro tem speaker by the government was unlawful as he was not the senior-most member of the House, the Supreme Court clearly said that there is no such rule and that conventions are not rules to be enforced. The SC did not accept Kapil Sibal’s arguments on this and quoted many previous instances in which members other than senior-most MP/MLA have been appointed as pro tem speakers. The rules of procedure of the Lok Sabha also state that though normally the senior-most member of parliament is chosen as pro tem speaker, there have been exceptions to this practice."

(File image: PTI) Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is lodged in Tihar Jail, has lost eight kilograms of weight since his arrest on March 21, the AAP said on Saturday, while adding that a medical board of the AIIMS has recommended including ”paratha and puri” in his diet. The Delhi High Court on Friday put an interim stay on the bail granted to Kejriwal by a trial court in a money-laundering case linked to the now-scrapped excise policy of his government. The high court is likely to pronounce its reserved verdict on the trial court’s bail granted to Kejriwal next week. In a statement, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said the regular weight loss of the Delhi chief minister is “highly worrisome”. On March 21, the day he was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), Kejriwal weighed 70 kg. The weight dropped to 63.5 kg on June 2 and further, to 62 kg on June 22, the party claimed. “The medical board of the AIIMS, in view of the dropping weight of Chief Minister Kejriwal, has recommended to include paratha and puri in his diet,” the statement said. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has got a few blood tests of Kejriwal conducted, it said, adding that the tests for heart ailments and cancer have not been conducted yet. The AAP said earlier, doctors of the Max hospital had recommended some tests for Kejriwal in view of his weight loss, including those for heart and cancer. The AAP national convenor had sought an extension of his interim bail granted by the Supreme Court by another week after June 2 to get the tests conducted, the party added. The apex court, which had granted bail to Kejriwal for 21 days to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls, refused to extend it further."

She had expressed her displeasure on social media after failing to get the nomination. During the seat sharing arrangement, the Hingoli seat was left to the Eknath Shinde led Shiv Sena. During the general elections, the BJP had given her the responsibility of poll chief of the Hadgaon Himayatnagar assembly constituency.

He was sent to 14 days judicial custody in the case. An FIR against Revanna was lodged on Saturday night after which he was summoned to the police station for questioning on charges of “unnatural offences” against him. He was questioned at Holenarasipura Rural police station for several hours following which he was arrested. Suraj was booked under IPC Sections 377 (unnatural sex), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 506 (criminal intimidation). Karnataka Home Minister G Parmeshwar said Suraj Revanna’s case will be handed over to CID. Suraj Revanna (37) is the elder brother of former JD (S) MP Prajwal Revanna, who has been arrested in connection with the sex video scandal. His father JD (S) MLA HD Revanna was jailed and out on conditional bail in a kidnapping case linked to the sex video scandal. His mother Bhavani Revanna is facing an investigation in a kidnapping case and was recently granted conditional bail from the court. A JD(S) worker named Chethan K S (27) had complained to the police that Suraj Revanna sodomised him at his farmhouse in Ghannikada in Holenarasipura Taluk on June 16 evening. The victim alleged that he had met Suraj Revanna at a function organised by him. Impressed by his organisational skills, Suraj Revanna allegedly shared his mobile number and started sending endearing messages with love symbols. He was asked to meet him at his farmhouse where he was allegedly sexually abused. Based on the complaint, the Holenarasipura police registered a case against the JD(S) MLC under IPC sections 377 (unnatural sex) and 506 (criminal intimidation) late on Saturday evening. However, Suraj has categorically refuted the charge. Instead, he has alleged that Chethan filed a false complaint to extort Rs 5 crore from him. The Karnataka Police have also filed an FIR against two persons on charges of extortion following allegations of sexual abuse against Suraj Revanna after the JD(S) leader’s aide Shivakumar filed a case against the victim and his kin at the Holenarasipura police station. Shivakumar said in the complaint that false allegations were made against Suraj Revanna to extort money. The complaint claimed that the accused had threatened Suraj Revanna with lodging a case of sexual abuse if he failed to pay Rs 5 crore. The police have registered a case under IPC Sections 384 (extortion) and 584 (criminal intimidation)."

As Monu looked at his phone to find the number, the attackers opened fire, killing the youth leader on the spot. Police found two shell casings at the scene. Bystanders attempted to catch the assailants, but they fired into the air and escaped. The youth leader’s supporters later tracked down the accused’s houses in the neighbouring MG Road area and set them on fire. They also vandalised vehicles parked nearby. Meanwhile, minister Vijayvargiya expressed grief and instructed police to take strict action against the accused."

Raje was addressing a programme in Udaipur organised to mark the death anniversary of RSS ideologue Bhandari. “You all know how many workers Bhandari helped and took them to the top. He held the fingers of so many workers and helped them move forward in their political career,” she said about the former governor of Bihar and Gujarat. “That era of loyalty was different. Today, people try to cut the finger which they held while learning to walk.” Raje also remembered and praised former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and former vice president Bhairon Singh Shekhawat among other BJP and RSS leaders, saying they guided her and many others. At the beginning of the programme, Assam Governor Gulab Chand Kataria stopped an elderly man from garlanding the guests at the event. Kataria said it is not appropriate to disturb an ongoing programme for offering a garland, which should be done after the programme. Later, Raje met the man, who was also an RSS worker."

(Image: PTI/File) The election of the speaker on June 26, as well as discussion over paper leak allegations in NEET-UG and UGC-NET and a row over the appointment of the pro-tem speaker will likely dominate the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha beginning Monday. Newly elected MPs will take oath on the first day of the session, while President Droupadi Murmu will address a joint sitting of both the Houses on June 27. Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has said he will personally raise the issue of paper leak in the two all-India examinations in Parliament and the opposition will put pressure on the Centre to ensure justice for students. The row over appointment of BJP leader and seven-term MP Bhartruhari Mahtab as the pro-tem speaker is likely to cast a shadow over the session, as the move has drawn flak from the opposition that alleged Congress MP K Suresh was overlooked by the government. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said Mahtab has had seven uninterrupted terms as Lok Sabha MP, making him eligible for the post, while Suresh lost elections in 1998 and 2004. He said this makes his current term as the fourth straight one in the lower house. Earlier, he was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1989, 1991, 1996 and 1999, he added. Lok Sabha MPs from the INDIA bloc will also assemble in the Parliament complex in the morning and march to the House together on the first day, sources said. The MPs will gather near Gate No 2 of the old Parliament building, where the Gandhi statue once stood, a senior opposition party leader said. Murmu will administer the oath to Mahtab as the pro-tem speaker of the Lok Sabha at the Rashtrapati Bhawan. The BJP leader will then reach Parliament House and call the Lok Sabha to order at 11 am. The proceedings will begin with MPs observing a moment of silence on the occasion of the first sitting of the 18th Lok Sabha, followed by Lok Sabha secretary general Utpal Kumar Singh placing on the table of the House the list of the members elected. Mahtab will then call upon Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Leader of the Lok Sabha, to take oath as member of the House. He will then administer oath to the panel of chairpersons appointed by the President to assist him in carrying out the proceedings of the House till the election of the Speaker on June 26. The President has appointed Suresh (Congress), TR Baalu (DMK), Radha Mohan Singh and Faggan Singh Kulaste (both BJP) and Sudip Bandyopadhyay (TMC) to assist Mahtab in administering the oath/affirmation to the newly elected members of the Lok Sabha. After the panel of chairpersons, the pro-tem speaker will administer the oath/affirmation as Lok Sabha members to the Council of Ministers. The members from states, in alphabetical order, will take oath or make affirmation over the next two days. The election to the post of Lok Sabha Speaker will take place on June 26 and the prime minister will introduce his council of ministers to the House soon after. The President is scheduled to address a joint sitting of both houses on June 27. The debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address will begin on June 28. Modi is expected to respond to the debate on July 2 or 3. Both the Houses are expected to go into a brief recess and reassemble on July 22 for the presentation of the Union Budget. The NDA government and the INDIA bloc have continued to spar over the issue of Mahtab’s appointment. Rijiju has accused the Congress of resorting to lies while the opposition has threatened to refuse to join the panel of chairpersons in the House. The Congress had alleged that the government violated procedures and conventions in ignoring Suresh. Opposition sources said Suresh, Baalu and Bandyopadhyay may not join the panel of chairpersons to assist Mahtab in administering the oath to the newly elected MPs. Suresh said his claim to the post of pro-tem speaker was overlooked as he is a Dalit, remarks scoffed at by Rijiju. Spokesperson of the BJP, Shehzad Poonawala said the Congress had deliberately insulted a “tribal” parliamentary affairs minister by lying on the issue of pro-tem speaker. “Congress has always insulted tribals. They called Droupadi Murmu ji ‘rashtrapatni’ and they even abused her,” Poonawala said. Rijiju said he may be the first tribal to occupy the post of parliamentary affairs minister but he will not be intimidated by the threats and lies of the Congress. “I will be bound by rules and will strictly follow Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji’s mantra of sabka saath sabka vikas,” he said. Earlier, Congress leader KC Venugopal had described Suresh being “overlooked” as an attempt at “destroying parliamentary norms”. “I have said this before and say this now, the battle for saving our democracy and constitution isn’t over yet,” Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray said in a post on X. D Raja, CPI general secretary, said even after a serious reprimand by the people by cutting the BJP to size, they have not understood the seminal importance of democracy, consultation, parliamentary norms and opposition for the country. “However, the totalitarian BJP cannot see an opposition member even as speaker pro tem and, thus, appointed a turncoat BJP MP to the post,” Raja said. To plan the floor strategy for the Parliament session, defence minister Rajnath Singh had chaired a meeting of senior ministers. Murmu is scheduled to spell out the NDA government’s vision for the next five years during this session. The meeting was attended by Union ministers S Jaishankar, Manohar Lal Khattar, Bhupender Yadav, Piyush Goyal, Dharmendra Pradhan, Kiren Rijiju, Annapurna Devi, Rajiv Ranjan Singh ‘Lalan’ and Chirag Paswan. Rajnath Singh is learnt to have sought inputs from the senior ministers, including NDA partners Lalan Singh of the JD(U) and Paswan of the LJP(RV), for the president’s address. They deliberated upon the possible candidates for the post of Lok Sabha Speaker and Deputy Speaker. The JD(U) has said it will support the BJP nominee for the Speaker’s post, while another key ally TDP has sought a consensus candidate for the coveted post. The opposition INDIA bloc has sought the Deputy Speaker’s post for its nominee, while the BJP is mulling giving the post to one of its alliance partners. The united march by the INDIA MPs from a spot where the Gandhi statue once stood will be a significant part on the first day of the session. This statue, which was a popular protest site for MPs in the Parliament complex, was recently relocated along with 14 other statues. All these were installed in one area, Prerna Sthal. A senior opposition leader said some MPs will hold copies of the Constitution and walk down to the Parliament building. Several opposition parties have claimed that the mandate of 2024 Lok Sabha elections was against the ruling BJP, even though it was able to form a government with support of NDA allies. The bloc has also claimed that people backed the opposition parties to “save the Constitution”. The Congress, which has held protests across the country over alleged irregularities in the medical entrance exam NEET, will also focus on raising the issue in Parliament. Party president Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that under the BJP’s rule, the “education mafia” has a free hand to indulge in corruption. “Seventy papers have been leaked in seven years and the future of two crore youth has been ruined. The NEET exam paper leak scam is a symbol of the Modi government’s utter indifference towards the youth,” he said. Kharge said his party will raise the voice of the youth strongly. Slamming the Centre over the alleged irregularities in NEET, Gandhi shared a video of his meeting with a group of aspirants and their parents amid the ongoing exams row. His sister and Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also launched a scathing attack on the government over exam paper leaks, saying the issue has become a national problem. (With PTI inputs)"

(File) Ready to flex its muscle, armed with issues and labelling the government and PM as “minus mandate” — This captures the Opposition’s placard for the Parliament session, the first after the Lok Sabha polls. While the government has done some firefighting over the NEET issue, the Opposition is in no mood to be placated. It’s an issue which it knows very well could resonate, especially with many students being upset with the last-minute deferment of NEET exams. So this is one issue which the combined Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) bloc wishes to raise. In fact, sources say the bloc plans to reach out to parties such as the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP), which until now have preferred to stay away. The bloc feels the students’ issue would ensure expansion of the Opposition platform. More than this, it’s the sheer optics on which the Opposition is riding. Topping the list for the Congress is the projection of Rahul Gandhi as the contender and achiever who “humbled the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)”. Adding to his muscle is Samajwadi Party’s (SP) Akhilesh Yadav, whose performance in Uttar Pradesh (UP) has shocked the BJP. Together with Rahul Gandhi, the UP wale ladke plan to “take them on”. The icing on the cake, as per the Opposition, is the sweet revenge in the win of KL Sharma from Amethi. The return of Mahua Moitra is another big win the Opposition is looking at. She has won with a huge margin after being disqualified as a Member of Parliament (MP) in her last term on charges of cash for questions. She had vowed to return to fight and the entire bloc had stood behind her. Her return will be showcased as vindication. Interestingly, after the acrimony between the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Congress during the Lok Sabha polls, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee has promised to campaign for Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Wayanad, when the bypolls will be held. While the Congress awaits her entry into the Lok Sabha, Banerjee’s gesture will boost the INDIA bloc ties. The TMC and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (DMK) performance in their states is one more point which they will raise against the BJP. But the fulcrum of the Opposition strategy is the narrative they are building, that this is a “zero mandate government”. The Congress calls the PM a “1/3rd PM” as the BJP failed to win a simple majority. Not just this, the Congress hopes that just as their United Progressive Alliance-2 was riddled and weakened by its tantrum-throwing allies, this National Democratic Alliance (NDA), too, will have to deal with the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Janata Dal United (JDU). “This honeymoon won’t last long,” is what the INDIA bloc says. The government is armed with ammunition, too, but the Opposition is unfazed. Even in this session, which is brief, with focus on President’s speech and oath, and the government’s expected fight on NEET, the Opposition is in no mood to step back. The plan is to put up an aggressive counter at every step in the Lok Sabha – Rahul + Akhilesh + Supriya Sule + Mahua is the axis they are looking at to make the BJP look weak. The Opposition feels their “achhe din” have come."

Taking a jibe at the opposition ahead of the inaugural session of the 18th Lok Sabha, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, in a strong message to the INDIA bloc, said that the country desires substance over drama from its lawmakers. “I hope that the opposition will live up to the expectations of the common citizens of the country to maintain the dignity of democracy. People do not want drama, disturbance. People want substance, not slogans. The country needs a good opposition, a responsible opposition,” Modi said, hoping that the MPs who have won will try to fulfill these expectations of the common man.

    "article_content": "Reported By : Anindya Banerjee & Payal Mehta News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 11:34 IST New Delhi, India Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the media at the Parliament House complex on the first day of the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha, in New Delhi on June 24, 2024. (PTI) The Narendra Modi government 3.0 faces a battle-ready and rejuvenated Opposition as the first session of the new Lok Sabha begins this week. While the opening day of the new session on Monday would mostly be about the newly elected MPs taking oath, Wednesday is when the real action gets underway – election of the Lok Sabha Speaker followed by an imminent showdown over the postponement and cancellation of entrance exams over paper leak and other alleged irregularities. Be it the protests over the conduct of NEET-UG 2024 or the cancellation of UGC-NET 2024, the National Testing Agency (NTA) has been the focus of the ire, forcing the government to replace its chief. With the NEET-PG exam being postponed at the eleventh hour, protests by medical aspirants have intensified as has the Opposition strategy to corner the government in Parliament. Top government sources indicated that all the facts will be laid there before the people of the country. “We are ready to answer all questions and put all the facts for the people to see. There is nothing for us to hide. Whether we need to speak on the floor of Parliament will depend on the permission and decision of the chair,” a top official told News18. The gravity of the situation can be assessed from the fact that Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan cancelled his visit to Delhi University to attend an International Yoga Day event on June 21. Hoping to capitalize on the students’ anger and giving a glimpse of what’s to come in Parliament, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has released a video message, promising students to fight for them “from the streets to the Parliament”. The CPI(M) Politburo issued a statement on Sunday, demanding Pradhan’s sacking over “sinister developments”. “…the entire government is accountable, particularly the HRD (education) Minister. He must resign,” read the statement. Nationalist Congress Party-Sharadchandra Pawar (NCP-SP) leader Sharad Pawar called the last-minute postponement of NEET-PG 2024 a “failure” of the central government. DMK leader and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin called it a “scam”. Shiv Sena (UBT), Samajwadi Party and Aam Aadmi Party have also held huddles to discuss their strategies. BJP sources say the Treasury Benches would rely on a three-pronged strategy to counter the Opposition in the Lok Sabha – Acknowledgement, Accountability, Attack. “The Centre doesn’t want to come across as insensitive at any point. We understand lives and futures of young minds are involved. After the Speaker’s election and the President’s address, when discussion begins, we will address the issue at hand without running away,” said a senior parliamentarian, adding that the strategy would be fine-tuned at the BJP Parliamentary Party meeting. The MP added that Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan will likely address the House reiterating what he said earlier about the integrity of the exams being “compromised”. Another Rajya Sabha MP cited the example of Rajasthan where the BJP has been at the forefront for nearly five years in protest against paper leaks in the state, mounting pressure on then chief minister Ashok Gehlot and Rajasthan education minister Govind Singh Dotasra. The MP added that the BJP is aware of how sensitive the issue is and hence its first step would way to acknowledge the problem. “The Centre will be doing exactly that,” he said. The Centre’s decision to shunt out Subodh Kumar Singh as the head of the National Testing Agency has already conveyed it won’t shy away from difficult decisions to fix accountability. Singh has been put on ‘compulsory wait’ in the Department of Personnel and Training. Retired 1985 batch officer Pradeep Singh Karola has been appointed in his place till a regular chief is appointed or until further orders. Karola’s first order of business, sources said, will be to work out the new dates for cancelled and postponed exams. Simultaneously, the government handed over the probe into the alleged irregularities, including paper leaks, in the NEET-UG exam to the CBI on Saturday. The CBI is also probing the alleged leaks that led to the cancellation of the UGC-NET exam. “The government has nothing to hide. We have not just acknowledged that the integrity of the examination was compromised but have also taken definitive actions. To the best of my understanding, the CBI has already registered an FIR and investigation is underway. We hope to bring the culprits to book very soon. If the Opposition continues to play politics over this issue, the government will cite how it has quickly fixed the problem,” said a senior BJP MP. Government sources added that it will strongly showcase how it has “quickly notified the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024 keeping students welfare in mind”. “There are two things that the government has done taking into account the seriousness of the issue. This is the only government which has actually brought a bill to stop exam paper leaks, and the rules will be notified soon. Secondly, we will also keep stringent watch again on the working of the coaching centres. Anyone who has done anything wrong will not be spared,” said a top government official. The stringent law, which was passed this February, is aimed at preventing paper leaks and cheating. Among its provisions is minimum jail term of three years for those found guilty of leaking a paper or tampering with answer sheets. The legislation allows for this punishment to be extended to five years with a fine of up to Rs 10 lakh. All offences under the Act will be cognisable and non-bailable. Another crucial clause in the law is that if examination service providers come across a possible offence but do not report it, they can be fined up to Rs 1 crore. “The government will also highlight the speedy actions if the Opposition chooses a war of words on the floor instead of constructive solutions,” the source added. Among those actions is the setting up of a high-level committee to look into the functioning and proposed reforms for the National Testing Agency. The committee is expected to come up with its report within two months, towards the last week of August. “The ministry won’t micro-manage the committee. They are acclaimed people. They will work on their own and give a report in two months. The committee will only take a call on whether the paper-and-pen mode can continue. There are pros and cons to both offline and computer-based test formats. We will look at the findings and decide,” a source aware of the development told News18. “If push comes to shove, the Treasury Benches will give it back and better,” said the government source quoted above. The BJP won’t be brazen about the issue, but won’t hesitate to attack the Opposition either, the source said. The BJP has already displayed its battle readiness in countering the Opposition on the choice of pro-tem Speaker. When Congress leader Jairam Ramesh claimed that Kodikunnil Suresh of the grand old party should have been the pro-tem given his seniority of eight terms, BJP leaders like Rajya Sabha MP Sudhanshu Trivedi and party spokesperson Shehzad Poonawala hit back hard. They asked Jairam Ramesh to make K Suresh the Leader of Opposition instead. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju retweeted both Trivedi’s and Poonawala’s X posts. BJP sources said that if the Congress chooses to play to the gallery, the Treasury Benches will attack Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra directly for their “silence” over consecutive paper leaks during the Congress rule in Rajasthan. And then there is Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Kumar Sinha’s allegation of the involvement of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav’s aide in the alleged paper leaks and discrepancies in NEET-UG. The Economic Offences Wing of the Bihar Police is now likely to question Pritam Kumar, who was personal secretary to Tejashwi Yadav. “Baat niklegi toh phir door talak jayegi (Now that the issue has been raised, it will be taken to its logical conclusion),” said a BJP Rajya Sabha MP."

(Right) Two senior parliamentarians – Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh- on Monday exchanged stormy barbs hours ahead of the first day of the 18th Lok Sabha Session. The back and forth between the two leaders began when Rijiju posted a welcome message for members of the 18th Lok Sabha this morning adding that he will be available to assist in the smooth functioning of the house. “The First Session of the 18th Lok Sabha begins today, the 24th of June, 2024. I welcome all the newly elected Hon’ble members. I shall be always available to assist the members as Minister of Parliamentary Affairs. I’m positively looking forward to co-ordination to run the house,” he wrote on X. The First Session of 18th Lok Sabha begins today, the 24th June, 2024. I welcome all the new elected hon’ble members.

Walk the Talk,” he said in reply to the minister’s post. Actions will speak louder than words Mr. Minister. Walk the Talk https://t.co/DrsuYAXf3p — Jairam Ramesh (@Jairam_Ramesh) June 24, 2024 To this, Rijiju gave a ‘tit for tat’ response to the Congress leader calling him an “asset to the House if he contributes positively”. “Absolutely Jairam Ramesh Ji. You are an intelligent member and you will be a valuable asset to the house if you contribute positively. Differences will remain amongst political parties in Parliamentary Democracy but we are united in our service to the nation. Looking forward to your cooperation in maintaining India’s rich Parliamentary traditions,” he wrote on X. However, Ramesh did not seem the one to back down and responded to Rijiju with a vile dig regarding the National Testing Agency (NTA) amid the ongoing paper leak controversy. Thanks Mr. Minister. I hope your certificate of my intelligence is not like the NTA grading. Is it with grace marks? https://t.co/dOe7NLVGkW — Jairam Ramesh (@Jairam_Ramesh) June 24, 2024 “Thanks, Mr Minister. I hope your certificate of my intelligence is not like the NTA grading. Is it with grace marks?” Ramesh added. The opposition leader’s remarks came amid a raging row over alleged irregularities in competitive exams, including the NEET-UG and the UGC-NET. The education ministry on Saturday set up a panel to review the NTA’s functioning, recommend exam reforms and ensure data security. Meanwhile, the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha commenced on Monday with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other newly-elected MPs taking oath as members of Lok Sabha. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Home Minister Amit Shah and Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari also took oath as members of the 18th Lok Sabha."

He said they planned to give the quota meant for Dalits, SCs, STs, and OBCs to Muslims in the name of religion.

Addressing a press conference, Delhi cabinet ministers said Atishi’s indefinite fast has entered the fourth day and her health is deteriorating. The ministers held a meeting at the hunger strike site in Jangpura’s Bhogal, where they decided to write a letter to the prime minister seeking a solution to the issue. “We also invite Delhi Lt Governor VK Saxena, and all officers to Wazirabad, Bawana to see the readings of flow metres and see the water levels of the river there. Data is available for the water released by Haryana and they can see for themselves how the water has reduced,” he said. Asserting that Delhi should get its due share of water, the minister announced that in the evening a candlelight march would be carried out in support of Atishi’s indefinite fast."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Aditi Ray Chowdhury News18.com Last Updated: June 22, 2024, 23:54 IST Delhi, India The Delhi LG said that the states are bound to release water as per agreements signed under the government framework. (PTI file photo) As serious water crisis grapples the national capital, Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena on Saturday slammed the Aam Aadmi Party and accused the Arvind Kejriwal-led government of using the water scarcity issue as an opportunity to blame neighbouring states. Asking Delhi government to work in a harmonious way with states like Uttar Pradesh and Haryana for its water needs, Saxena said, “No general has ever won a war by fighting with his own army.” He then went on to say that the politically elected government’s hostility spills over to its own officers and thereby singularly deflects attention from the inadequacy of its own political leadership. In an official statement, the Delhi LG said, “The shrill discourse of the Ministers of the GNCTD over the last few weeks, has been distressing and questionable at various levels. Drinking water supply has become a challenge in the national capital in the backdrop of a searing heat wave, which has gripped northern India. Political leaders of Delhi have turned a crisis into an opportunity for blaming neighbouring states, with the sole aim of gaining political mileage.” He further claimed that this has only ended up “compounding the problems of the residents of Delhi and antagonizing the neighbouring states, who are themselves grappling with water scarcity.” Saxena also pointed out that Delhi is dependent on drinking water supply from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana and that interstate water sharing arrangements are settled through institutional mechanisms created by the Ministry of Jal Shakti, Government of India. He also said that the states are bound to release water as per agreements signed under this framework. “At the same time, the city government is under an obligation to ensure that this water resource is used efficiently to ensure equitable supplies across the city. Unfortunately, neither has the city government, demonstrated seriousness in ensuring improvement in water networks and augmentation of capacity, nor has it chosen a path of dialogue,” he added. Saxena also underscored the fact that since the last 10 years, the AAP Government did not add a single litre to the water treatment capacity, which it had inherited from its predecessor Sheila Dikshit Government. He also claimed that the supply and distribution network of pipelines are old and leaking. “DJB should have invested resources in repairs and replacement of old lines, which has resulted in avoidable leakages and thefts. By the Government’s own admission, in its Economic Survey, the unaccounted for water in Delhi is to the tune of 54%. 40% of water is wasted. A network of illegal tankers operated by “tanker mafia” under political patronage is bleeding the city. This happened even as Haryana kept supplying the share of water assigned to it,” the LG’s statement read. The Lieutenant Governor also mentioned about the ‘heart rending’ scenes of people running after tankers and incidents of water shortage, and that this sight not new in Delhi. Aam Aadmi Party leader Saurabh Bharadwaj responded to the LG’s statement on water crisis said that the LG has ignored the efforts of the Kejriwal government to modernize Delhi’s distribution system and prevent water losses in the last 9 years. He also said that he agreed with Delhi LG that governance should be conducted in a harmonious environment, with a spirit of conciliation and accommodation. He further said, “But we are unable to understand why does the LG not hold the BJP-ruled Haryana government to the same yardstick, despite being fully aware that the Haryana government has been blocking over 100 MGD of Delhi’s rightful share of water for the past many days.” Further, the AAP leader summarized the Kejriwal government’s efforts towards water distribution system in the national capital, that was submitted to the Supreme Court. A delegation of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), including its MPs, MLAs and senior leaders, will meet Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena here on Sunday to find a solution to the deepening water crisis faced by the city. AAP national secretary Pankaj Kumar Gupta in a letter to Saxena on Saturday said that all the MPs, MLAs and senior leaders of his party will meet him at 11 am regarding the water issue. Amid the blaring heat, residents in several areas of the national capital continue to face severe water shortages as many people line up in queues to collect water from tankers. The areas which have particularly witnessed water cuts are Chilla Gaon in Mayur Vihar, Sanjay Colony in Okhla, and Geeta Colony. Atishi, who is sitting on an indefinite hunger strike in south Delhi’s Bhogal, said she will continue to fast till 28 lakh people of Delhi do not get their share of water from Haryana. The AAP minister began her indefinite hunger strike on Friday to press on her demand for more water from Haryana. Delhi is facing an unprecedented heatwave, as a result of which the water demand has increased. The issues of water theft and the role of private tankers in aggravating the water crisis have seen the BJP and the AAP taking potshots at each other."

    "article_content": "PTI Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 13:40 IST Guwahati [Gauhati], India Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. (File pic/PTI) Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday claimed that members of the Bangladesh-origin minority community overwhelmingly voted for the Congress in this Lok Sabha election, without considering the developmental work done for them by the BJP-led governments at the Centre and in the state. He also alleged that it is the only community in Assam which indulges in communalism. Speaking at a felicitation programme of winning candidates of the BJP and its allies at the party’s state headquarters here, he said the ruling alliance garnered nearly 47 per cent of the votes polled, while Congress and its allies bagged 39 per cent of the votes. The BJP-AGP-UPPL coalition won 11 out of the 14 Lok Sabha seats in the state, with Congress bagging the remaining three. “If we analyse the 39 per cent votes of the Congress, it is not spread across the state. Fifty per cent of it is concentrated in 21 assembly segments which are minority dominated. In these minority-dominated segments, BJP got 3 per cent votes,” he claimed. “This proves that Hindus do not indulge in communalism. If anyone indulges in communalism in Assam, it is only one community, one religion. No other religion does it,” the CM asserted, without naming any sect. He said that the minority-dominated areas may have no roads, no electricity, but they have been voting overwhelmingly for Congress and did so again. In contrast, though BJP has been working for the Assamese people and tribals, these communities have not voted 100 per cent for the saffron party, he added. “Except in Karimganj, if we consider the centres with majority Bangladesh-origin people, 99 per cent of votes have gone to Congress,” he said. “They (minority people) may be residing in houses given by (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi, availing electricity and sanitation facilities provided by Modi, but when they go to vote, they vote for Congress,” Sarma claimed. He maintained that the Bangladesh-origin community will vote for Congress because they want to “control the state in the next 10 years”. Sarma alleged that the members of the community attacked a police station in Lakhimpur, a village in Barpeta and tried to encroach land in Kokrajhar when the BJP government was “inactive” since the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) was in place.. “When BJP government will not be there, one can only imagine how many such attacks will happen,” he added. The CM said the BJP and its allies had won 92 out of 126 assembly segments in this Lok Sabha election, which was the highest ever for any ruling alliance in the state. “This time, we got 47 per cent votes. Our target will be to get 50 per cent of the votes in 2026 state polls,” the BJP leader added. Sarma asserted that BJP is into politics for nation building and will continue to work for development of all parts, irrespective of whether its candidate had won or not from those areas."

Akash’s campaign events were also cancelled. Akash Anand started his political journey in 2017 at the age of 22. He holds an MBA degree from London. In June 2019, during BSP’s national executive meeting, Anand assumed the role of the party’s national coordinator. The 29-year-old was designated as Mayawati’s political heir in December last year. The exact reason for the move remains unclear but it came soon after he was booked by the Sitapur police in Uttar Pradesh, along with other party members, for allegedly violating the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) during the Lok Sabha Election 2024 after made derogatory remarks against BJP. However, after a series of setbacks, especially the debacle during the Lok Sabha polls, the BSP cadres had been seeking a change in leadership for the party’s survival. Quoting the party cadres, a report by news agency IANS said that BSP performance deteriorated after Akash Anand was restricted from campaigning. The BSP has won no seats in the Lok Sabha elections and is left with just one seat in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly. Its status as a national party is also at risk. This is the party’s worst electoral performance since its inception in 1984. “The party has been steadily tumbling down after the 2012 Assembly polls but Mayawati is not bothered. There has been no discussion at any level in the party and everything — from crucial decisions about alliances to ticket distribution — is decided by her, except the blame for the defeat. If the BSP has to survive, there is a need to effect a change in the leadership at the earliest so that we can regain lost ground in the 2027 Assembly elections,” the report quoted a former party coordinator as saying. A former BSP MLA said that the party leadership had forced a majority of the party leaders to seek options in other parties and had expelled the remaining leaders."

(File Image) Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Sunday drew flak over his social media post in which he mocked competitive examinations in Uttar Pradesh amid recent incidents of paper leaks. Tharoor shared an image depicting an answer sheet with a question, “Uttar Pradesh kise kehte hain? (Define Uttar Pradesh.)” The answer to the question reads, “Woh pradesh jahan pariksha se pehle uttar pata chal jaaye use Uttar Pradesh kehte hain.

Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma took to microblogging site X and wrote, “This gentleman frequently indulges in satirizing various cultures (first Northeast and now UP) with remarkably caustic words. He has succumbed to the beguiling whispers of lunacy, his mind adrift in the ethereal mists of derangement.” Minister of State (MoS), Commerce and Industry Jitin Prasada called Tharoor’s remarks for Uttar Pradesh “deplorable”. “I don’t see the humour in running down my state and its people by stereotyping them with such condemnable remarks. Such an insult to UP is deplorable and must be condemned in the strongest words,” he wrote in an X post. BJP leader Rajeev Chandrashekhar called Tharoor’s post a “shameless crass politics of shaming other fellow Indians” BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan called Shashi Tharoor a “repeated offender” and said that “implying UP is a state of cheaters is indefensible and unpardonable”. “Shashi Tharoor is a repeat offender who had earlier gravely insulted our North East brothers and sisters by ridiculing their traditional attire as outlandish. To belittle a serious issue, implying that the state of UP is a state of cheaters is indefensible and unpardonable. Splattering fancy English words does not necessarily make one civil and dignified,” Kesavan said. BJP leader Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore accused Shashi Tharoor of not seeing UP as his own and, therefore, “deriding” it. “Shashi, you having to resort to frivolity!! And in doing so condemning people of an entire state? You don’t see UP as yours, since you are deriding it. How I see Kerala is it’s my state, it’s my people. Bright, young, dynamic Keralites have served with me in the Army and rubbed shoulders with me in ‘Team India’. When a person of your stature and intelligence mocks a State, why wouldn’t others do? And then what!!” an X post by Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said."

(X) With the arrest of another member of HD Revanna’s family on charges of sexual abuse, the political legacy of the elder son of former Prime Minister and Janata Dal Secular (JDS) patriarch HD Deve Gowda seems to be tainted. HD Revanna spent 10 days in jail after being accused of kidnapping and sexually molesting a house help. His wife, Bhavani, recently managed to get anticipatory bail from the Karnataka High court in a case of kidnapping a woman, who filed a First Information Report (FIR) alleging that Bhavani’s son Prajwal sexually assaulted her. Revanna’s son and Hassan MLC Suraj is the latest member of the Gowda family to be arrested in an alleged sexual assault case, after his brother Prajwal, who is under police custody for multiple FIRs of rape. Suraj has been accused of “forced unnatural sex\" with a party worker.

Vishwanath, who was the state president of the JDS in 2018, but stepped down due to internal differences, called the arrests of the Revannas a sign of “karma\". “Deve Gowda is the Dhritarashtra in the family. He turns a blind eye, and only cares about furthering the political future of his family and not the people who have brought him to this position.\" Political analysts say the JDS family is certainly in turmoil. Sandeep Shastri pointed out that while there may be a debate about whether the cases are true or false, the fact that members of a particular political family are being targeted remains significant. “There can be no smoke without fire, and the fact that they have enjoyed power and position for very long, in the process developing many friendships, alliances as well as earning enemies and brickbats, now comes home to roost,\" said Shastri. He added that there seems to be a consolidation of circumstances where different members of the family are alleged to be involved in certain practices, and their political opponents will try to take advantage. “The whole game of seeking political advantage is not the cause, but a consequence,\" he added. The Karnataka police booked Suraj and his close aide Shivakumar after an FIR by a JDS party worker, alleging that the MLC forcefully stripped and sexually assaulted him on June 16 at a farmhouse in Gannikada village in Hassan. He alleged that Suraj asked him to “meet him whenever he’s free\" and messaged him on WhatsApp. The complainant recounted his horror to the police, stating how he had been given an appointment with the MLC as he wanted to work for the party. Upon reaching the farmhouse at the appointed time, he was asked to close the door and sit. In graphic detail, the complainant mentioned how Suraj caressed him and began fondling him, despite his repeated protests. ALSO READ | Suraj Revanna, Brother Of Controversy-Hit Prajwal Revanna, Arrested For Alleged Sexual Assault On JD(S) Worker Promising him a bright career in the party and full support, the survivor was allegedly dragged onto the bed, sexually assaulted and forced to participate in anal and oral sex. “I fell at his feet, begged him to leave me alone, said I was not comfortable, but he said it would get better with time and that all those who want to grow have to go through such things in life,\" said a detailed complaint letter that was sent by the survivor to the Karnataka Home Minister and Director General of Police (DGP). After a medical examination of the survivor and other mandatory checks, the complaint was converted into an FIR, which led to the arrest. The survivor had messaged Suraj on June 17, the night after the alleged assault, that his life had been ruined by his forced sexual act and that he was extremely hurt and upset. In the exchange of messages, he said that he had confessed to his family what took place between them and since then has been scared to go back home. The survivor had also messaged Shivakumar separately and asked him to provide support. The aide is said to have met the survivor around midnight, asked him to accept compensation and cautioned him against filing a police case against Suraj or face death. A series of phone calls and messages, including one from Suraj, pressured the survivor to accept Rs 2 crore and a job offer for his silence. He was warned about going to a hospital for treatment and was told that the aide would come with him and pay his bills. He refused the offer and, fearing for his life, fled to his paternal uncle’s house. The survivor was tracked down on June 9 and again threatened by Shivakumar to accept the offer or face a case of extortion. This was the case of extortion that Shivakumar filed on June 22 against the survivor and his brother-in-law. In a counter-complaint, the survivor accused Suraj of sexually assaulting him.

He filed a complaint with the Karnataka Home Minister and DGP with photographs of both Suraj and Shivakumar. Suraj’s aide claimed in his FIR that the survivor tried to befriend Suraj by becoming a member of the ‘Suraj Revanna Brigade’ and later threatened to accuse Suraj of sexual assault, initially demanding Rs 5 crore. Shivakumar claimed that later the amount was reduced to Rs 2 crore, but the MLC did not budge as the claims were false. The Hassan police then filed a case against the survivor and his relative under Indian Penal Code sections 384 (extortion), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention). Both Shivakumar and Suraj have now been arrested. Prajwal was arrested on May 31 after three women filed FIRs against the former Hassan MP, stating they were sexually assaulted multiple times by the leader. Pen drives containing over 2,000 clips of various women in compromising positions, which the survivors claim were forced as they were blackmailed and threatened, were circulated across Hassan district just days before the seat went to polls during the Lok Sabha elections. As a political party, the JDS has decided to react only after the investigation into the case is completed. Speaking to News18, JDS MLC and spokesperson TA Saravana said that the party core committee will soon sit down to decide on the actions to be taken against Suraj Revanna. “This is a political conspiracy against the JDS. Our opponents are targeting Hassan and are coming out with such unsavoury and filthy allegations, which we will wait for the law to address and give us justice,\" he said. ALSO READ | ‘Come Back To India And Face The Law, Or Face My Anger’: Deve Gowda’s Warning To Grandson Prajwal Revanna Saravana added that the senior JDS leaders are upset with the developments and have been observing how the Gowda family’s political opponents are targeting each member one by one, starting with Prajwal. “We believe in God, the legal system and our leader Deve Gowda ji. He is right now going through unbearable pain to see what is happening within his family. Let’s wait and see how the investigation progresses,\" Saravana said. Still under shock and fearing being targeted or facing the wrath of the Revannas, JDS party workers have been largely mum about the issue. However, after much persuasion, a JDS local leader opened up to News18, saying, “This is definitely a major sign of the end of the Revanna family’s political future. The truth is being unearthed, and the filth and horror of the family, which kept a firm control over Hassan, is now out in the open. We only hope the victims get justice.\" Calling the arrests of the Revanna “karma\", Vishwanath said there was no political conspiracy to finish the Revanna legacy. “There is no political conspiracy against them. These are the fruits of their karma. Time brings out all truth; let’s wait and see what happens.\""

Filmmaker Hansal Mehta, who started his career with the television show Khana Khazana and later moved on to directing films like Dil Pe Mat Le Yaar! and Yeh Kya Ho Raha Hai? and Woodstock Villa, to name a few, need no introduction. Currently, he is making headlines for the recently released web series Lootere on Disney+Hotstar. In a recent media interaction, the National Award-winning filmmaker shared many of his experiences with the recently released show, which is currently garnering everyone’s attention. Filmmaker Hansal Mehta spoke about his “single largest” contribution to Jai Mehta’s Lootere. He said that he played the role of someone who used all the tricks of the field of Indian filmmaking. Hansal Mehta, the showrunner of Lootere, further said, “The biggest challenge was to make a series like Lootere on such a scale within a budget. How does one achieve a story like this with a scale like this without going overboard with the cost, without compromising on the storytelling, and without compromising on the director’s vision?” “Without compromising on how Jai wanted to tell the story, My role was primarily to see that Jai’s larger vision did not get compromised because of any constraints and that he could tell the story feel,” Hansal said. He further added that he played the role of somebody who used all the tricks in the Indian filmmaking book. He also learned one thing as a filmmaker: that cost can never limit one’s vision; the cost can never limit any thinking, and that was his main contribution to Lootere. Talking about the action series, Lootere was created by Hansal Mehta and Shaailesh R Singh and directed by Jai Mehta. The show revolves around off the coast of Somalia. When the passengers of an ill-fated ship are taken hostage by pirates, an unlikely hero must step forward to save them all.

    "article_content": "Curated By : Entertainment Bureau Local News Desk Last Updated: April 15, 2024, 13:11 IST Delhi, India The web series marked the OTT debut of Kajal Aggarwal. Many horror movies in the movie industry leave people spooked and sleepless for nights. If you are someone who likes such content, there is one particular web series which was released in 2021 and stars one of the most talented pan-Indian actresses. The movie’s plot and the star cast’s performance were highly appreciated by the critics and won the hearts of the audience. Live Telecast, written and directed by Venkat Prabhu, is a Tamil-language horror thriller series. It features pan-Indian actress Kajal Aggarwal, Vaibhav, Anandhi, Ashwin Kumar Lakshmikanthan, Daniel Annie Pope and Priyanka Nair. The movie is currently streaming on Disney plus Hotstar. Live Telecast is set in the year 2005 and begins with the team attending the success party of the Dark Tales show, where the plot introduces all the characters of the movie. This horror web series marked the OTT directorial debut of Venkat Prabhu. It is about Jennifer Matthew, a selfish, TRP-hungry woman who is ready to exploit the superstitions of the people to drive her show and offer content to the audience. Jennifer and her production crew try to bring back their show on rank 1 by shooting in a house where demonic activity was sensed by a few. However, things take a turn for the worse when they come to know that the house is haunted and they experience paranormal activity, first-hand. The web series shows Kajal Aggarwal stepping into a different role and shows her as a grey character with almost no moral compass. Generally, the actress portrays the role of a bubbly or lively character, but in this series, the director brings out her strong personality on the screen, where she is seen heading a team. In an interview, the Singham actress once shared her excitement to be a part of the show. She said that as an actor, one should be very versatile. She believes that in films they can’t do much, but in web series, there is a lot of opportunity to showcase the talent. She expressed her gratitude for getting to work with Venkat Prabhu as she marked her OTT debut with Live Telecast."

Sonakshi Sinha is currently making headlines for the much-awaited web series Heeramandi. Recently, the actress shared her experience of working with director Sanjay Leela Bhansali and playing her character Fareedan. This news is currently garnering everyone’s attention. Let’s take a look. In a recent interview with the Hindustan Times, Sonakshi Sinha shared her experience playing the role of Fareedan in Heeramandi. This is the first collaboration between Sonakshi and ace director Sanjay Leela Bhansali. In the interview, Sonakshi said, “This is a character I have been waiting to do for a very long time. I have always wanted to play a slightly negative, slightly villainous character, and I am thankful to Sanjay sir that he saw me in this role. I don’t know how or why, but I guess that’s just his trust in me as an actor that I will be able to pull it off. It is motivating for an actor when a director like him imagines and attempts to depict you in a way that no one has ever seen you before. So I am so grateful. It has been one of my favourite characters that I have played on-screen.” Sonakshi further said that she thinks Sanjay Leela Bhansali has given her a great opportunity by giving her the role of Fareedan. “The character is a complete ‘Mirchi’. Wherever she goes, she adds spice,” Sonakshi added. She further added that, for her, the last 7-8 years as an artist, doing different roles and portraying very strong female characters on screen has been a constant endeavour. She added that for Akira, she took the first step to move away from commercials and masala potboilers and choose different genre films. Since then, she has constantly tried to play great roles that were different from each other. Sonakshi also said she has been lucky since her first OTT release, Dahaad, and now Heeramandi. She bagged two big shows. She shared that she feels blessed to be a part of these two series and play these two beautiful characters. Her efforts to play a strong female lead and give the audience a Sonakshi that they have never seen before will continue, she added. Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar is backed by Bhansali Productions and Prerna Singh. The series also features Manisha Koirala, Richa Chadha, Aditi Rao Hydari, Sharmin Segal, Sanjeeda Shaikh, Fardeen Khan, Shekhar Suman, Adhyayan Suman, and Taha Shah in pivotal roles.

Richa Chadha, who delivered an impactful performance as Lajjo in the series, has also been receiving glorious compliments. But did you know she was offered another role in the show but, however, chose to essay Lajjo? The actress recently opened up about the same. Richa knew that Lajjo had the most heartbreaking arc, and the resemblance to Meena Kumari from Pakeezah and a female version of Devdas would definitely leave an impact. She shared, “When I was approached for ‘Heeramandi,’ at the time Sanjay sir was the showrunner, and I had been offered another part, one with more screentime for sure. But because an actor also needs to see what’s in here that’s new for me, I chose Lajjo.” She added, “I have experimented with characters that have a grey shade, like Bholi Punjaban or Tara in Madam Chief Minister. Basically, I get accused of playing only empowered characters, so i felt the need to break that stereotype and surprise the audience. I wanted to play a part of a hopeless romantic and leave the audience with goosebumps. That’s exactly what’s happening. People are calling me in tears.” She further revealed, “Hence, when sir told me, come and check this character out, I was immediately drawn to Lajjo. I was certain this would pay off, and it has. The love within 24 hours has been overwhelming. Right from industry peers to filmmakers to friends and audiences have sent me such amazing love, I couldn’t be more grateful.” Richa’s portrayal of Lajjo in Heeramandi” showcases her versatility and dedication to her craft, earning praise for her nuanced performance that resonates deeply with viewers. Additionally, the character’s Kathak dance sequence in the show holds special significance for Richa, who is a trained Kathak dancer herself. “I’ve always harboured a desire to incorporate Kathak dance into my onscreen roles, and ‘Heeramandi’ provided the perfect opportunity to do so. As a trained Kathak dancer, bringing Lajjo’s dance number to life was a fulfilling experience for me, adding another layer of authenticity to the character,” she added. The Sanjay Leela Bhansali series also stars Aditi Rao Hydari, Manisha Koirala, Sonakshi Sinha, Sharmin Segal, and Sanjeeda Shaikh in the lead roles."

When you hear the name Sanjay Leela Bhansali, you immediately visualise exquisite sets, cinema in its most grand form and compelling storytelling, generally from a long bygone era. The filmmaker is known for perfection in making period pieces like Devdas, Bajirao Mastani, and Padmaavat and is currently gaining acclaim for his OTT debut Heeramandi. Heeramandi tells the story of an era when courtesans had royal status. It aims to portray the themes of love and betrayal experienced by courtesans in pre-independence India. Set against the backdrop of the 1940s freedom struggle, the web series delves into the lifestyles and social status of courtesans during that era. It is a known fact that Sanjay Leela Bhansali always chases perfection and one of his leading actresses from Heeramandi narrates an incident that shows the level of perfection he desires in his projects. In an interview with Rediff, Aditi Rao Hydari shared her insights on working with Sanjay Leela Bhansali. When asked about her opinion on Bhansali’s working style with actors, she contradicted the general belief that the filmmaker is a stern taskmaster. Aditi described him as a versatile individual, rich in human emotions, art, music, and dance. Despite his extensive experience in the industry, she highlighted Bhansali’s continuous quest for excellence, which serves as an inspiration to everyone involved in his projects. During the same interview, Aditi discussed the thorough preparation for the web series and shared more behind-the-scenes details. She recounted a fiery scene showcased in the series trailer, which was executed with great care. Aditi mentioned that for this scene, Sanjay Leela Bhansali advised her to refrain from eating beforehand. The actress shared that the director believed that starving her before the scene would capture the intensity required in the scene. She said, “ One day, he kept me hungry because I had to do a scene which was full of fire. He said, ‘Aaj khana mat khana’, (Don’t eat today) and that helped me get that simmering sense of injustice.” Along with Aditi Rao Hydari, other actresses in the series include Manisha Koirala, Sonakshi Sinha, Richa Chaddha, Sanjeeda Sheikh and Sharmin Segal.

    "article_content": "Published By : Chirag Sehgal Trending Desk Last Updated: May 21, 2024, 19:02 IST Mumbai, India Rafuchakkar is a heist comedy web series. (Photo Credit : Instagram) Maniesh Paul has done a variety of roles in his career, many of which required him to gain and lose weight, or learn different accents. Recently, he shared an Instagram post that showed him getting transformed into a white-haired old man with the use of prosthetics. These photos were taken when Paul was getting into a character for Rafuchakkar, a 2023 web series. In the comedy heist show, Paul switched between five very different appearances throughout nine episodes. Even though prosthetics are no longer uncommon in the film and TV industry, their use remains taxing. The prosthetic artists have to spend several hours mastering the look. The person who is getting the look has to stay still while the make-up is being done and later spend hours till the shoot is wrapped up. In his post’s caption, Paul mentioned the hardships of working under prosthetics and wrote, “This used to take 4.5 hours of make up time!!! Painful…too much gum on the face..itchy…but it was worth it…this was another character I played for my web series Rafuchakkar.” A post shared by Maniesh Paul (@manieshpaul) In the comments, many people lauded Paul for his dedication and hard work towards the role. Some people commented that the prosthetic makeup made him look like veteran actors Piyush Mishra and Anupam Kher. Before the release of Rafuchakkar, the writers and producers of the show, Arjun Singgh Baran and Kartik Nishandar, told Film Companion that Paul gained and lost over 20 kilograms to prepare for his lead role in the web series. They also commented on his elaborate prosthetic look and wrote, “Despite being claustrophobic, he wore heavy prosthetics in intense heat. He even learned the local dialect of each city where the characters were located for the sake of authenticity. He loves challenges and pushes his boundaries to mold himself into a new person each time.” In Bollywood one of the first successful films that utilized prosthetic make-up was Avvai Shanmugi in 1996 and its Hindi remake Chachi 420. In these films, actor Kamal Hassan transformed into an elderly woman for a significant part of the film. Hassann’s prosthetic make-up was managed by K M Sarathkumar and Oscar-winning prosthetics expert Michael Westmore, best known for his work in Star Trek productions. In 2009, R Balki’s Paa showed Amitabh Bachchan as a progeria patient, a rare disease that causes rapid ageing in kids, once again bringing the magic of prosthetics into the limelight."

Many outsiders, who don’t have any leads in the entertainment industry, come to Mumbai with dreams of becoming actors. During the initial days, they have to go through a lot of struggle and often have to take up small jobs to support themselves. One such actor, who worked at Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan’s wedding, has now become a celebrity. The actor has collaborated with several well-known celebs, including Akshay Kumar, Anushka Sharma, and Pankaj Tripathi. He began his acting career with small roles in films, but later OTT made him a star. Can you guess the actor? He is none other than Aasif Khan. Today, let’s take a look at his struggle journey. According to reports, when Khan’s father passed away, he had to face a lot of struggle. He took small jobs to earn a livelihood. But he always has a dream to become an actor. In 2010, he convinced his mother to allow him to pursue acting. In an earlier interview, Aasif shared that during the beginning of his career to sustain himself in Mumbai, he started working as a waiter and said, “To sustain myself, I started working as a waiter at a hotel. After a few months, when I was working in the kitchen department, we had a party, which was Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor’s reception.” Later, he left that job and worked for some time in a mall. Aasif then gave some auditions and joined a theatre group in Jaipur. Aasif began his entertainment career as a casting assistant, and when it came to acting, he started his journey as a junior artist. He was seen in Salman Khan’s Ready and Hrithik Roshan’s Agneepath. Then, he made a cameo appearance in the Akshay Kumar-starrer Toilet Ek Prem Katha. He finally made his Bollywood debut in the movie India’s Most Wanted, alongside Arjun Kapoor. However, the film did not do well at the box office. He then turned to OTT. The actor made his OTT debut in 2018 with Mirzapur, where he played Babar, a loyal aide. Aasif Khan came into the limelight after his performance in the hit show Jamtara, and since then, he has never looked back. He then starred in Panchayat.

    "article_content": "Published By : S Aadeetya Trending Desk Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 08:00 IST Apple's premium focus might be shifting to another segment with the next Vision Apple might ditch its ambitions with a premium mixed reality as reported by The Information. Amid the slowing sales of the Vision Pro headsets, the iPhone maker has been finding ways to reduce the cost of components and manufacture a more affordable Vision product with fewer features. The company aims to ship the rumoured cheaper vision headset before the end of 2025. The report says Apple’s cheaper Vision headset reportedly codenamed N109, aims to keep the high-resolution screens that make the Vision Pro stand out. It also focuses on removing some features and making it “at least one-third lighter.”The Cupertino-based tech giant intends to price the cheaper Vision headset at a price that’s in line with a high-end iPhone. We have previously heard rumours about Apple targeting a price point between $1,500 and $2,500 (Rs 1,25,000 and Rs 2,08,600) for the affordable Vision Pro model, which could be called Vision headset. The Cupertino-based company had originally planned to divide its Vision product into two models similar to the standard and Pro versions of its iPhone. So, it is possible that Apple might follow this trajectory after all. The same report further states that Apple has struggled to reduce prices without sacrificing too much on features, so this cheaper headset is unlikely to show up in early 2025. The company is still putting effort into Vision Pro and plans to add a bunch of new features with VisionOS 2. To boost the sale of the $3,500 (approximately Rs 2,91,000) device, which has been struggling with slower demand after initial enthusiasm, the company has announced that the Vision Pro headsets will be available in eight new countries, which includes Japan, Australia, Germany and China among others. There were also reports about the headset coming to the Indian market later this year but it is possible that Apple might have changed those plans, unless it feels there is a demand for the premium headset in the country."

    "article_content": "Curated By : S Aadeetya News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 08:30 IST Adobe changed its terms of service after facing massive backlash Adobe is the latest company to face questions about its AI policy and how it plans to train its AI systems. Many people criticised the platform for using its terms of service to cheekily mention the fact that their data will indeed be used to train these models. However, after a massive backlash over the past few days, Adobe has decided to roll back those terms and assured its customers and everyone else that it will never use their data to train AI systems. The decision was much expected because Adobe started losing many customers who were cancelling their subscription to show their anger against the company’s policies. AI systems need to be trained on existing dataset and for a company like Adobe that mostly comes through its established content catalogue, which belongs to someone else. In an ideal world, Adobe should have been clear about its AI data policies from day one, rather than mask it behind lengthy terms of service that most people tend to avoid reading. But the company has been forced to change its stance and strategy which should become an example for any company that plans to dive into the AI world and is hoping to use customer data to train, improve and make it better. In Adobe’s case, the data training done using customer content was going to be a double-edged sword that has come back to bite it. After all, Adobe is using AI tools that could one day become as effective as the people who develop, design and create items and materials using Adobe products. While Adobe pledges to never use data for training AI systems, one can never be sure of these companies and take them for their word. The need for a stringent AI policy is getting stronger by the day and until that happens, we will see more cases like these up where the companies will act on such moves only when it gets called out in the public."

(Reuters) -Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer will provide server racks for the supercomputer that Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI is building, the U.S. businessman said on social media platform X on Wednesday. Dell is assembling half of the racks for xAI's supercomputer, Musk said on X. In a reply to another post enquiring about the second partner, the billionaire said \"SMC\" – referring to server maker Super Micro. San Francisco-based Super Micro, known for its close ties with chip firms like Nvidia and its liquid-cooling technology, confirmed the partnership with xAI to Reuters. Dell CEO Michael Dell also said in a separate post on X that the company was building an \"AI factory\" with artificial-intelligence heavyweight Nvidia that would power the next version of xAI's chatbot Grok. Musk has told investors that his artificial intelligence startup xAI is planning to build a supercomputer to power the next version of its AI chatbot Grok, according to a report by the Information in May. Training of AI models such as xAI's Grok requires tens of thousands of power-hungry chips that are in short supply. Earlier this year, Musk said training the Grok 2 model took about 20,000 Nvidia H100 graphic processing units (GPUs), adding that the Grok 3 model and beyond will require 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips. Musk has said he wants to get the proposed supercomputer running by the fall of 2025, according to the Information. Musk founded xAI last year as a challenger to Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Alphabet's Google. Musk also co-founded OpenAI."

Ilya Sutskever has announced his new company called Safe Superintelligence or SSI that promises to tackle the ‘most important problem of our time.’ He is starting this AI company with a sole and unified goal to keep superintelligence safe. “We’ve started the world’s first straight-shot SSI lab, with one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence,” Sutskever mentioned in his post on X this week. I am starting a new company: https://t.co/BG3K3SI3A1 — Ilya Sutskever (@ilyasut) June 19, 2024 Sutskever decided to leave OpenAI, the company he co-founded with Sam Altman and others earlier this year. He has even been accused of being the main orchestrator of getting Altman ousted, which is now a history that neither of them would like to talk about as they look at the future. In some ways, he takes a dig at his former company which was heading towards building shiny products rather than focus on the safety and ethics of the technology. “Our singular focus means no distraction by management overhead or product cycles, and our business model means safety, security, and progress are all insulated from short-term commercial pressures.” It is interesting to see him talk about safety but not without keeping a tight grip on the advancements as well. “We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead,” he adds. Sutskever has already got Daniel Gross and Daniel Levy working alongside at the company, which claims is based out of Palo Alto in the US and Tel Aviv in Israel. The focus on safe intelligence has been mentioned by other staff and engineers at OpenAI, who are leaving the firm in a bid to keep the AI systems in check rather than go astray in search of quick success. OpenAI is going after the shiny products and not focusing on safety of AI systems and processes, as pointed out by Jan Leike, former AI researcher at OpenAI who quit the company and shared these details in the public. Leike also lashed out at the company, warning them of the need to control the rapid advancement in AI that can turn into a dangerous situation for all of humanity. Sutskever seems to be headed in that path to secure the AI systems and it will be hardly surprising to see Leike join their ranks in the coming weeks."

    "article_content": "Reported By : S Aadeetya News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 10:57 IST Delhi, India Sennheiser Momentum 4 TWS earbuds fights in the premium segment. Sennheiser is one of the many audio brands that aspires to appeal to the premium audience with products like the Momentum series. The company has its lineup catering to both wireless and TWS segment, and over here we are talking about the Momentum 4 TWS earbuds that are available in the market for Rs 18,990 where you have Sony and Apple among others with their premium offerings. The Momentum 4 has a tough fight on its hands but Sennheiser seems well equipped to handle the challenge and we used the earbuds to see if the value translates into quality for most people. Sennheiser has opted for a balanced sound profile on the Momentum 4 TWS earbuds and most people would like that profile which allows you to listen to different genres. We enjoyed listening to the mellow tracks of Yanni that are heavy on instruments and you want clarity seeping through the buds tickling your ears. That’s what the Momentum 4 TWS offers in most cases. Similarly, if you prefer the heavy bass stuff, these earbuds will keep you happy without going overboard with the bass which is a good trait if you want to listen to music wearing these for a long duration. You get support for hi-res codecs for the premium audio quality experience, a big must-have for audio products in this range. Talking about the noise cancellation, Sennheiser gives it a triple mode, which includes the transparency option. The main ANC mode works effectively and the sound isolation lets you enjoy the music or movies as the earbuds fit snugly in the ear and block out all the ambient sound and disturbance. You can tweak the settings of the mode from the compatible app which runs on Android or iOS devices. Sony launched the WF-1000 series TWS earbuds a few years back when the charging case was bulky and the earbuds hung out from the ear. The Momentum 4 TWS is following that pattern in 2024 which is not ideal. We prefer the charging and the earbuds to trim down so that you don’t feel the weight of the buds in the ear. One earbud weighs 6.2 grams while combined with the charging case it comes to 72 grams for the Momentum 4 TWS earbuds. In comparison, Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbud weighs 5.9 grams which is noticeable in the ear, while the case comes at just 39 grams which is almost half the weight of the Momentum 4 case. The one good thing about the size is that you will never have to worry about them falling off. Some might say that having a bulker design means space to fit more drivers and battery but convenience surely has to be part of the package as well. Having said that, the charging case is made of premium materials, even though we are not sure of its long-term durability because of the finishing. Sennheiser prides itself with the features and you see those traits in the compatible Smart Control app. The moment you pair the device, the app gives you a wide range of details, including the ability to change the equaliser settings and the manual option to change the ANC mode (on-off-transparency). The company also has a smart guide to help you toggle the controls on the buds. Speaking of which, we feel the touch controls are a little too sensitive for our liking. Even the slightest contact activates various features on the earbuds. You have to tap three times to activate ANC which is interesting but the usual playback controls worked too easily during our tests. Sennheiser promises up to 30 hours battery life with the case and we didn’t feel the need to charge the device repeatedly which speaks volumes. Having said that, going by the size and dimensions of the earbuds and the case, we would have expected more juice out of the box. All in all, the Sennheiser Momentum 4 TWS earbuds deliver on most fronts and if you can look beyond the weighty nature of the product, these are a good fit for most people, especially with the different tip sizes available in the box."

The messaging app wants to change that system and make it easier for people to transfer chats from an old device to a new one. New developments suggest WhatsApp will soon use QR code to help you shift chats and other content to a new device which means you are completely able to bypass the need for storing/saving the chats on Drive account. So, how is WhatsApp going to use QR code to help you transfer chats between devices? The details shared by WaBetaInfo claims that when you switch to a new phone and download WhatsApp, the messaging app will create a new QR code for the current device which consists of your chat and data history. One would have to point the WhatsApp on this QR code to get the chat transfer started. The feature has been spotted in the development stage with Android beta version 2.24.9.19 which should be available soon to the beta testers. The new method will surely help people who don’t want to pay for Google Drive as the WhatsApp backup storage counts against their cloud space these days. Having said that, we still don’t know how the chat transfer via QR code will work. We are sure that you will need both the devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network, but do they also need to be plugged in, and how much time will the chat transfer take with this new method. More importantly, will WhatsApp detect a new device when you sign up in it or it can be done seamlessly. These things are likely to become clearer when the beta Android version offering this feature rolls out which should happen in the next few weeks."

    "article_content": "Curated By : S Aadeetya News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 15:34 IST California, USA The M4-powered MacBook Pro is expected to launch later this year Apple introduced the M4 chipset with the iPad Pro model earlier this year which surprised many. But the company is already preparing the stage to bring the first M4-powered Macs to the market later this year. Apple usually slots in the new Macs for an October launch after the big iPhone reveal and this year we could see the tradition continue. The details about the possible M4 MacBook Pro launch has come via Ross Young, who is a display analyst tracking the industry developments. Young has pointed out that the panel shipments for new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models will start in the third quarter of 2024, which falls in line with the possible October launch timeline. AI-Powered Macs Incoming? We had previously heard reports about Apple planning for a MacBook Pro and Mac Mini M4 upgrade later this year from Bloomberg, and Young is more or less confirming those expectations. The M4 is Apple’s new 3nm process chipset which is being pitted against fellow AI processors from Intel and Qualcomm for AI PCs or Macs in this case. The display panel and design were recently upgraded so the biggest change with the M4 MacBook Pro is going to be the hardware, which the company claims is 25 percent faster than the M3 chipset and also brings a host of AI features or Apple Intelligence as the company is calling it. The macs will also come with the macOS Sequoia version this year which will offer these features thanks to the built-in M4 chip from the company. Using the new chipset means Apple has more room to increase the prices of the MacBook Pros but as we have seen with the iPad Air and iPad Pro 2024 models, we don’t foresee that happening with the new launches."

    "article_content": "Curated By : S Aadeetya News18.com Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 07:30 IST Apple's three big executives spill the beans on what you need to run its AI features Apple Intelligence was revealed in front of the world at the WWDC 2024 this month and there has been a lot of talk about Apple’s AI tech and who will get to use them. It has been made abundantly clear that only if you own the iPhone 15 Pro or higher models you can use the AI features from the company. But until now we were waiting for Apple to spill the beans and tell us the main reason for this limitation. After all, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are powered by an equally powerful A16 Bionic chipset, why can’t it possibly run these AI tools? The company executives have shared the details in a talk show from the WWDC 2024 which has come out this week. The video covers a wide range of topics but the biggest question we had to focus on is related to the Apple Intelligence features. Could old iPhones also run the AI tools that were showcased earlier this month? Apple executives John Giannandrea, Greg Joswiak, and Craig Federighi who divided the focus with their field of expertise. “When you run these models at runtime, it’s called inference, and the inference of large language models is incredibly computationally expensive. It’s a combination of bandwidth in the device, the size of the Apple Neural Engine, and the device’s power to run these models quickly enough to be useful,” as highlighted by Giannandrea in the video. He went on to add that, “You could, in theory, run these models on a very old device, but it would be so slow that it would not be useful,” which answers the basic question of these limitations and is there is a sinister thought for this move. Various analysts have hinted that the AI move from Apple could be a masterstroke as more people look to make the iPhone upgrades, does the company agree to these views? “No, not at all. Otherwise, we would have been smart enough just to do our most recent iPads and Macs too, wouldn’t we?,” it was Greg Joswiak from the marketing team to share his views. But we still don’t get a credible reason, at least from the hardware point of view, until Federighi decides to join the conversation and share his technical insight into Apple Intelligence and what it needs to really show the best results. He does mention that Apple wants and tries to bring all the features to older iPhones, and in most cases it does. But Apple Intelligence is a different kettle of fish which needs specific hardware to run. Then he points out that the A17 Pro chipset with 8GB RAM is the ideal combo to make the AI features work seamlessly. The hardware running on the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max comes with a 16-core Neural Engine which you don’t with the A16 Bionic running on the iPhone 15 and Plus models. Similarly, you need the M-series powered Macs or iPads to run the AI features that also come with 8GB memory out of the box. Having said that, we expect Apple to bring the A17 Pro to all the iPhone 16 series models later this year, which means you won’t have to spend big and get the iPhone 15 Pro to use the Apple Intelligence features."

    "article_content": "Trending Desk Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 08:00 IST The new AI tool can create audio for videos using the advanced AI model. Google DeepMind is working on a new AI model that can generate soundtracks and dialogue for videos. In a recent blog post, the tech giant’s AI research lab unveiled V2A (Video-to-Audio), a new work-in-progress AI model that “combines video pixels with natural language text prompts to generate rich soundscapes for the on-screen action.” Generating videos from text prompts is making a splash in the creative world. The majority of the available tools, however, have a major drawback and are limited to silent videos. Google DeepMind’s V2A is designed to work seamlessly with Veo, Google’s text-to-video model that was introduced at the I/O 2024 last month. This combination allows users to improve their videos not just visually but also audibly. V2A can also breathe life into “traditional footage” like silent films and archival material, reported the Indian Express. This AI model technology aims to change the way users create and experience AI-generated videos. It can be used to add realistic sound effects, dramatic music, and dialogue that matches the tone of the video. The V2A model can generate an unlimited number of soundtracks for any video. Users also get the chance to tweak the audio output with ‘positive prompt’ and ‘negative prompt’, which can be used to get the sound right and tune the output to your preferences. In addition to that, every piece of the generated audio is watermarked with SynthID technology to make sure it is original and authentic. DeepMind’s V2A represents a significant leap forward in AI-powered video creation. The new technology takes the description of a sound as input and uses a diffusion model trained on a mix of dialogue transcripts, sounds, and videos to fill a crucial gap, making videos more immersive and engaging. While the model is powerful, V2A has not been trained on a large number of videos yet and the output might come out distorted at times. Hence, to prevent any potential misuse, Google said that it won’t release V2A to the public anytime soon."

    "article_content": "Reported By : S Aadeetya News18.com Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 08:30 IST Delhi, India Xiaomi 14 Civi brands Leica cameras to a whole new segment. Xiaomi has taken an understated approach of trimming its phone lineup rather than stuffing the market with similar-spec phones with different names. The Xiaomi 14 series has shown us the company has the nous to fight it out with the big boys, and those claims have been strengthened with the 14 Ultra launch this year in the country. Now, the brand is giving us a taste of its Leica-partnered engineering with the Xiaomi 14 Civi smartphone. Priced at Rs 42,999 this new phone is entering a segment where the competition isn’t as fierce but you still have quality alternatives available. Can the Leica-totting 14 Civi match it up with the peers and give us the extra oomph that the market is craving for? Here’s our Xiaomi 14 Civi review that does its best to give these answers. Xiaomi has taken pointers from the 14 series and offered it with basic tweaks on the 14 Civi. The sleek design and quad-curved screen brings a new layer of design that is ergonomically comfortable and gives you a good grip without feeling delicate. It measures at 7.8mm in thickness and weighs 177 grams which makes it one of the lightest in the segment. We got the black variant which has a matte-ish finish and continuity that gives it a good look. The rounded camera module sits on the side rather than in the middle which somehow gives it a balance that you can only experience to know more about. Even the frame gets aluminium finish which gives it the consistent flow that most people like. You also have a matcha green colour which comes with a leather-like finishing that some of you may find flashy. Having said that, there is very little to complain about the design of the 14 Civi, and if we are to nitpick something, we would say that some people might find it too sleek to hold. Also, Xiaomi hasn’t taken any IP rating for the device which should have been offered. The biggest takeaway from the premium 14 series for us has been the evolution with the Leica-engineered lenses. To keep the costs down, Xiaomi has fiddled with the setup, giving you a 50MP primary along with a 12MP ultrawide and a 50MP telephoto. You immediately notice the familiar interface and the colour tones offered by Leica on the other 14 series phones. The sensors aren’t as powerful as 14 or the 14 Ultra but still makes a decent shout with its quality. The main sensor gets OIS which allows you to click well detailed and crisp images where the colours are balanced in most cases. However, the 50MP telephoto lens could have used OIS support which means low light doesn’t become a hindrance for its performance. The portrait shots look natural but we did notice the edge detection being off in some cases. These issues are not grave and a quick update to patch most of them. The front dual 32MP shooters were a surprising package and if you turn off the beauty mode, the snaps give the natural skin tone and details are intact as well. Xiaomi has offered an AMOLED panel with 120Hz refresh rate screen and Dolby Vision but what you don’t get is LTPO for adaptive refresh rate on the screen. It seems the company has focused on the core aspects of the product and decided that it could do away with the LTPO tech on the panel which seems to have helped with the cost of the device. Having said that, there isn’t much to complain about the quality of the display, the colours that pop out and the overall multimedia experience. Having the dual selfie cameras in the notch (or a bar) is another addition that brings visual changes to the screen. Xiaomi is the latest brand to join the ranks of the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 bandwagon. The 14 Civi comes with up to 12GB RAM and 512GB UFS 4.0 storage that translates into reliable and effective performance without going overboard. This combination promises reliable and efficient performance without unnecessary extravagance. In fact, it’s being hailed as a chipset for affordable flagships, and benchmark tests seem to confirm this notion. You can enjoy the popular intensive games without any major stutter but don’t expect gaming-level performance that premium devices offer. We would rank the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 slightly below the 8 Gen 2 with its graphics output but on the whole, the new chipset made a strong showing. Xiaomi is offering the Android 14-based HyperOS out of the box which continues with the focus on pre-loaded apps like PhonePe, Opera Browser, and Netflix among others. You also have to disable apps like Themes and GetApps to stop the annoying notifications. The company is promising 3 OS upgrades and 4 years of security updates for the 14 Civi and we have already seen its proactive focus on offering these security patches quickly. The sleekness of the phone means you only have a 4700mAh battery that would be fine if you can manage with charging the device at least once. Most phones these days come with at least 5,000mAh battery so it seems Xiaomi has decided to trim things down which means the overall backup is average compared to the others. You also get 67W wired charging speed which isn’t the swiftest in this range but does the job. Xiaomi 14 Civi promises a lot of premium features, which includes the design, build quality, the display and the cameras largely deliver but could use some improvements. The battery life takes a hit at the cost of the petite frame but nothing alarming when you have fast-charging support."

    "article_content": "Reuters Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 09:00 IST The platform seems resigned to getting banned unless there is change. WASHINGTON: TikTok and Chinese parent ByteDance on Thursday urged a U.S. court to strike down a law they say will ban the popular short app in the United States on Jan. 19, saying the U.S. government refused to engage in any serious settlement talks after 2022. Legislation signed in April by President Joe Biden gives ByteDance until Jan. 19 of next year to divest TikTok's U.S. assets or face a ban on the app used by 170 million Americans. ByteDance says a divestiture is \"not possible technologically, commercially, or legally.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia will hold oral arguments on lawsuits filed by TikTok and ByteDance along with TikTok users on Sept. 16. TikTok's future in the United States may rest on the outcome of the case which could impact how the U.S. government uses its new authority to clamp down on foreign-owned apps. \"This law is a radical departure from this country’s tradition of championing an open Internet, and sets a dangerous precedent allowing the political branches to target a disfavored speech platform and force it to sell or be shut down,\" ByteDance and TikTok argue in asking the court to strike down the law. Driven by worries among U.S. lawmakers that China could access data on Americans or spy on them with the app, the measure was passed overwhelmingly in Congress just weeks after being introduced. TikTok says any divestiture or separation – even if technically possible – would take years and it argues that the law runs afoul of Americans' free speech rights. Further, it says the law unfairly singles out TikTok for punitive treatment and \"ignores many applications with substantial operations in China that collect large amounts of U.S. user data, as well as the many U.S. companies that develop software and employ engineers in China.\" ByteDance recounted lengthy negotiations between the company and the U.S. government that it says abruptly ended in August 2022. The company also made public a redacted version of a 100-plus page draft national security agreement to protect U.S. TikTok user data and says it has spent more than $2 billion on the effort. The draft agreement included giving the U.S. government a \"kill switch\" to suspend TikTok in the United States at the government’s sole discretion if the company did not comply with the agreement and says the U.S. demanded that TikTok's source code be moved out of China. \"This administration has determined that it prefers to try to shut down TikTok in the United States and eliminate a platform of speech for 170 million Americans, rather than continue to work on a practical, feasible, and effective solution to protect U.S. users through an enforceable agreement with the U.S. government,\" TikTok lawyers wrote the Justice Department in an April 1 email made public on Thursday. In 2020, then-President Donald Trump was blocked by the courts in his bid to ban TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat, a unit of Tencent in the United States. The White House says it wants to see Chinese-based ownership ended on national security grounds, but not a ban on TikTok. Earlier this month, Trump joined TikTok and has recently raised concerns about a potential ban. The law prohibits app stores like those of Apple and Alphabet's Google from offering TikTok. It also bars internet hosting services from supporting TikTok unless it is divested by ByteDance."

Sounds weird? AI is everywhere these days, and it is even after our jobs in some cases. Many dating apps have started using the technology and soon AI could be dating on your behalf, as one of the dating apps chief said. But things aren’t going to end there. Now, you have an Instagram-like social media app that allows you to sign up using AI characters and chat and navigate across content from different AI profiles. No, this is not a dystopian script from the sci-fi show Black Mirror, this is all possible now with an app called Butterflies which claims to bring AI to life. You download the app just like any other from the Play Store. You sign up for your account and that’s where the similarities end. The app creates an AI character for your profile that not only interacts with AI accounts, it can also generate AI photos and co-exist with humans who are also present in their AI avatars. We have already seen the impact of AI on social media, as they make their presence felt in the form of AI-generated ads or AI characters posing as profiles, which is what Butterflies is offering now. The concerns of AI taking over social media is the lack of credibility and possible scope of creating parody accounts that can be misused by bad actors. These AI profiles on Butterflies allow you to interact, create and chat with other profiles but make no mistake, the content and context of these conversations are going to be weird and we can’t understand the point of snowballing AI into anything and everything. We will give it a test drive to see if AI can actually make an impact on these platforms but more importantly, to see how it goes with the psyche of humans who are used to interacting with others of their kind."

    "article_content": "Curated By : S Aadeetya News18.com Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 12:49 IST Delhi, India WhatsApp calls will soon get the AR treatment. WhatsApp video calls recently got three new features that are closer to being a Zoom or Google Meet rival. But the messaging app has aspirations far higher than its existing standards and by that we mean offering a rich experience for calls. The new Android beta version hints at major upgrades for the feature, which includes augmented reality. Call filters and effects make the experience engaging and interactive rather than seeing a boring screen with the face on the other end. AR has the scope to liven up the calling experience further and WeBetaInfo has dug out new scoop that suggest these features might soon be coming to the messaging app. WhatsApp is also testing the option to change the background during calls that other platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Google Meet provide for their calls. The tipster has been able to spot the testing interface which has filters, background and effects at the bottom of the calling interface. “Users will be able to personalise their calls by enabling dynamic facial filters, such as a touch-up tool for smoothing skin appearance, and a low-light mode to improve visibility in dim environments,” the post shares the details about the upcoming tool. As for the background changing option, WhatsApp plans to extend the support, understandably, to the desktop version at a later date, which makes a lot of sense, as most of these important calls at work are originating through the bigger screens for people. That’s not all, WhatsApp will also give you the ability to change your face with a digital avatar on these calls, which becomes a big privacy boost for millions who are happy to mask their visual identity when they don’t need to show their face in calls. All these features are still being tested, so we’ll get a clearer launch timeline after we see it come to the public beta version."

The upcoming feature will enable users to search for music using verbal prompts and voice commands. Users will have the ability to describe music videos or request music similar to a specific song or artist. The AI feature, expected to replace the current voice search function on the Google app, was discovered in the YouTube Music app for Android version 7.06.53, as detailed by Android Authority. The sources further indicate that this feature is still in the experimental phase. Meanwhile, the disclaimer in the code states, “AI-generated responses are experimental. Quality and accuracy may vary. Please don’t enter confidential or personal information regarding yourself or others.” Currently, YouTube Music needs users to manually input specific songs or artists for track searches. However, the new “Ask for Music” feature represents a significant advancement by allowing users to use language commands to convey their requests. Initially, a select group of Android device users will have access to this experimental feature, with wider availability expected in the near future for the general public. Interestingly, YouTube Music has also introduced the ability to “Hum to Search” for a song. This innovative feature allows users to search for any song by simply humming, singing or whistling a melody. This feature will eliminate the need to write precise lyrics for the track. The feature is very useful for users to discover songs they have heard but may not remember the exact title or artist. The company even lets users create playlist covers generated by AI. On the other hand, YouTube Music is also working on a new app launch animation, similar to the official YouTube app. While the Ask for Music feature has not been officially announced, we’re hoping to see more details from the platform in the coming months about its release and availability to the premium subscribers."

This innovative technology allows users and creators to unleash their creativity on the platform like never before. Imagine describing a scene and watching it materialise in your surroundings instantly. With this new feature, “vision becomes a reality.” Reports indicate that users will be able to type a description and generate a 3D image in real time. Unlike earlier versions of AR technology, which had limitations, developers can now create more realistic and sophisticated lenses. The company’s tech chief Bobby Murphy said, “What's fun for us is that these tools both stretch the creative space in which people can work, but they're also easy to use, so newcomers can build something unique very quickly. This and future real time on device generative ML models speak to an exciting new direction for augmented reality, and is giving us space to reconsider how we imagine rendering and creating AR experiences altogether.” The company made this major announcement at the Augmented World Expo, which was held in California, USA. According to TechCrunch, users can expect to start using lenses very soon, while creators will be able to begin making lenses by the end of this year. Bobby Murphy further claimed that the model will be compact which will help it run on a smartphone and will have enough speed to re-render frames in real time. Along with Generative AI, Snapchat is also rolling out a variety of new AI tools to simplify the creation of unique AR effects for creators. The latest Lens Studio update introduces new face effects, allowing creators to command or upload images to generate custom lenses that can dramatically modify a user's facial appearance. While the exact release date for the new feature, GenAI, has not been announced yet, users can expect the launch in the coming months."

The app’s package name will reportedly be “com.google.android.apps. pixel.creativeassistant”. A new ‘remix’ option would appear in the Markup app, which is expected to provide sticker production functionality with generative AI features. This sticker can then be applied to a screenshot or image. However, an official announcement from Google regarding the new creative AI app is still awaited.

According to other reports, all three smartphones are expected to be powered by the Tensor G4 SoC and may include AI capabilities. The Pixel 9 XL is supposed to be an entirely new handset.

The company’s operations in the US presented a national security risk “due to the Russian government’s offensive cyber capabilities and capacity to influence or direct Kaspersky’s operations,” the US Department of Commerce said in a statement on Thursday. “Kaspersky will generally no longer be able to, among other activities, sell its software within the US or provide updates to software already in use.” Private and professional users of Kaspersky’s widely installed antivirus software should find an alternative due to the risk, the Department added. “Russia has shown time and again they have the capability and intent to exploit Russian companies, like Kaspersky Lab, to collect and weaponise sensitive US information, and we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to safeguard US national security and the American people,” Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said. The sale of Kaspersky software in the US will be banned from July 20. The Russian multinational will be able to provide software updates to existing users until September 29. Kaspersky’s software is designed to protect users against trojans, spyware and other cyber threats. In the US, installation on government devices has been banned since 2017, and in Germany, the Federal Office for Information Security warns against using the software. Kaspersky has denied its products pose a risk, stating it is a private global cybersecurity company with no ties to the Russian government."

As Samsung gears up for the upcoming launch of its Galaxy S25 series, leaks about the device have already started circulating online. Among the latest information is a leak concerning the camera specifications of the S25 lineup. Surprisingly, it appears that the company may not be introducing any major upgrades to the cameras. According to reports, the basic model of the S25 will feature a main camera with a 50MP sensor, maintaining the same resolution seen in the previous three generations, S22, S23, and S24. Additionally, the resolution of the front camera, which was 12MP , is expected to remain unchanged. While the megapixel count of both the front and rear cameras remains untouched in the base model, Samsung enthusiasts can expect some improvements in their ultra-wide angle and telephoto cameras. However, there has been no confirmation about these changes yet. Initially, there were rumours that the upcoming phone might feature only three cameras. However, it was later reported that the S25 will indeed come with four camera sensors. On the other hand, as per Galaxy Club, the Samsung S25 Ultra is rumoured to receive major camera upgrades, including a quad rear camera setup. This setup is said to feature a 200MP main camera, a 50MP sensor with 5x optical zoom, a 50MP ultra wide angle sensor along with a 50MP telephoto sensor with 3x optical zoom. When Samsung launched the Galaxy S22, the company faced criticism for reducing the battery capacity to 3700 mAh, while its predecessors, the S20 and S21 were running on 4000 mAh. Fortunately, with the launch of S23, Samsung improved the battery to 3900 mAh and S24 had 4000 mAh capacity. Now, with the upcoming launch of the S25, the company is expected to stick with a 4000 mAh battery. Reportedly, the particular model could have a 6.36 inch display and will be powered by the Exynos 2500 chipset. While Samsung is expected to launch the Galaxy S25 series in January 2025, the upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event on July 10 is likely to witness the launch of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6 models and the debut of the Galaxy Ring."

    "article_content": "Reuters Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 11:56 IST China AI chips have got Nvidia flying and ByteDance wants a piece of it. BEIJING: China's ByteDance is working with U.S. chip designer Broadcom on developing an advanced AI processor, two sources familiar with the matter said, a move that would help TikTok's owner secure sufficient supply of high-end chips amid U.S.-Sino tensions. The 5 nanometre chip – a customised product known as an application-specific integrated chip (ASIC) – would be compliant with U.S. export restrictions and manufacturing work would be outsourced to Taiwan's TSMC, the sources added. There have been no publicly announced chip development collaborations between Chinese and U.S. companies involving 5nm or more advanced technology since Washington introduced export controls for cutting-edge semiconductors in 2022. U.S.-China deals in the sector generally concern much less sophisticated tech. ByteDance's tie-up with Broadcom, an existing business partner, would help slash procurement costs and ensure a stable supply of higher-end chips, said the sources, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of semiconductor issues in China. TSMC is, however, not expected to start manufacturing the new chip this year, they said. One of them said while design work is well underway, the \"tapeout\" – which marks the end of the design phase and the beginning of manufacturing – has not started. ByteDance and Broadcom did not respond to repeated requests for comment. TSMC declined to comment. Like many global tech firms, ByteDance has launched a major push in generative artificial intelligence but the company and its Chinese peers have to contend with far more limited supply of AI chips than their overseas counterparts. Nvidia's most advanced chipsets are out of reach due to U.S. export controls aimed at impeding breakthroughs in AI and supercomputing by China's military. Competition for U.S. chips developed specifically for the Chinese market as well as those from rival Huawei, one of the few Chinese makers of AI accelerators, is fierce. ByteDance and Broadcom have been business partners since at least 2022. The Chinese firm has purchased the U.S. company's Tomahawk 5nm high-performance switch chip as well as its Bailly switch for AI computer clusters, Broadcom has said in public statements. Securing AI chips is crucial for ByteDance to make its algorithms more powerful. In addition to TikTok and the Chinese version of the short-video app called Douyin, ByteDance operates a range of popular apps including a ChatGPT-like chatbot service called Doubao, which has 26 million users. To support its AI push, ByteDance has stockpiled Nvidia chips, according to a separate person who was briefed on the matter. This includes A100 and H100 chips available before the first round of U.S. sanctions kicked in as well as A800 and H800 chips that Nvidia made for the China market but were also later restricted, the person said, adding that ByteDance allocated $2 billion for purchases of Nvidia chips last year. ByteDance also purchased Huawei's Ascend 910B chips last year, two separate sources with knowledge of the matter said. Bytedance currently has hundreds of semiconductor-related job openings posted, including 15 for ASIC chip designers, according to checks of its website. It has also been poaching top people from other Chinese AI chip firms, according to one of the sources who has direct knowledge of this issue."

    "article_content": "Reuters Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 09:00 IST The company is going to integrate the workforce and its infrastructure (Reuters) -Microsoft-backed OpenAI has acquired search and database analytics startup Rockset to provide better infrastructure for its enterprise products, the ChatGPT maker said on Friday. The companies did not disclose the deal size. OpenAI used its shares to buy the company in a stock deal that valued Rockset at a few hundred millions, marking it one of its largest acquisitions by the fast rising AI lab, according to sources familiar with the matter. OpenAI declined to comment on deal details. The company was last valued at $86 billion in a tender offer by investors earlier this year. Rockset, founded by former engineers at Meta, builds real-time search and analytics databases, and has benefited from the use of artificial intelligence in applications from chatbots and detecting anomalies. Backed by Greylock, Sequoia and Hewlett Packard Enterprise's venture capital arm, Rockset said last year it had raised $105 million in total funding. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT Rockset said its team will join OpenAI and the technology will power the retrieval infrastructure of the ChatGPT maker's enterprise products. This means Rockset's expertise in real-time data processing and vector search will enhance OpenAI's ability to quickly access and analyze vast amounts of information, likely leading to faster and more accurate responses from AI models, as it tries to sell enterprises tools to rapidly index and search among their data. CONTEXT OpenAI is looking to stay ahead of the curve by expanding its offerings, built on the success of its consumer-facing product ChatGPT. OpenAI has pitched ChatGPT Enterprise, the enterprise version of its chatbot and its AI services known as APIs, to executives at large enterprises. It is also integrating new functionalities in ChatGPT and developing new AI models to fend off competition from the likes of Alphabet's Google and Anthropic, among others. Reuters reported last month OpenAI has been developing a search engine product to potentially compete with Google and AI search startup Perplexity."

Apple Intelligence is making its way to iPhones later this year, and the company has also got OpenAI on board to bring ChatGPT to the devices. But Apple is facing a big issue related to its AI ambitions in one of its biggest markets, Europe and China. During the WWDC 2024 earlier this month, Apple suggested it won’t stop looking for more AI partners, which isn’t surprising since Apple was reportedly talking to Google earlier. Now, reports say Apple is ready to partner with Meta for its big push as well. Apple and the EU have been in an ongoing battle over various issues, which also catapulted the change of iPhones to support USB C for charging. But now, the company faces a tough challenge getting its AI features to the region, owing to the limitations posed by the Digital Markets Act. Some of the AI features from Apple face regulatory pressure, which seems to have forced the company’s hand to delay their availability which will be a big loss for the consumers as well as Apple. Similarly, the AI objective in China and its regulatory framework means Apple’s official OpenAI deal to bring ChatGPT will not be functional in the region. Instead, Apple will have to partner with a local AI company to bring their localised features and regulated setup to appease the Chinese government and also keep the consumers happy by giving them all of those features on their latest devices. This isn’t the last time we are hearing about Apple’s AI pressure in different markets but hopefully that doesn’t deprive users of these features that are claimed to be secure and privacy-proof."

After the European Union changed the game, the Indian government is ready to follow suit and finalise the move to standardise USB C as the go-to charging port for mobile devices next year. According to new reports, the government has even set a deadline for this change which will force the rule on all the manufacturers in the country and mandate the use of the latest charging tech as the default option. The report from Livemint this week has quoted multiple sources, who claim the deadline for this change has been revised from March 2025 to June 2025. Like the EU ruling, India also wants USB C to become the standard charging port for mobile devices and also the cables that are used to charge smartphones and tablets. The same report hints at laptops becoming next on the hit list for USB C charging that will come into effect from the end of 2026. As you would expect the ruling is going to exempt categories like wearables and hearables (wireless audio gear) for the time being. These changes come as the country looks to reduce the e-waste situation which has become a global issue and a stringent order is required to curtail its spread. The good news is that most smartphone brands, including Apple, have already adopted USB C as the charging standard for their devices, so the transition is unlikely to pose a challenge for the companies. Having said that, we are hoping that the feature phone segment gets a leeway from this ruling as a possible increase in the price of the low-cost phones for millions could affect their livelihood and make them buy expensive phones that are 4G enabled. Companies are investing in sustainable materials to make their devices but one cannot deny that the after-usage service of phones is lacking. Having a unified charging standard will mean that people can use the same charger to charge all their phones, including iPhones."

Pixel devices are assured of quick security updates from Google but even then, a major zero-day security issue has come to light recently which affects millions of Pixel users across the globe and in India as well. Going by the details of the zero-day vulnerability facing Pixel users, the issues can be exploited by threat actors to bypass the device security and plant malware or any other virus. “These vulnerabilities exist due to improper input validation flaws within the Exynos RIL, Modem, LWIS, ACPM, Fingerprint sensor, telephony, audio, WLAN host, Trusty OS, Pixel firmware, LDFW, Goodix, Mali, avcp, CPIF, and GsmSs subcomponents in Pixel devices,” CERT-In highlights the range of issues faced by Pixel devices. – Pixel 5a – Pixel 6a – Pixel 6 – Pixel 6 Pro – Pixel 7 – Pixel 7 Pro – Pixel 7a – Pixel 8 – Pixel 8 Pro – Pixel 8a – Pixel Fold Google has issued its own security bulletin detailing these issues and even the security patch is already out there. So, if you use a Pixel device that is vulnerable to these issues, we suggest you update to the latest version or security patch right away. You can install the latest security update by going to Settings – System – Software Updates and install the version available from the company. Those of you using the Pixel 4a model in India are not affected by these issues and they will not be getting more updates from the company."

The company is doing its usual marketing blitz to keep the product hype going on social media. The CMF catalogue already has the Buds and the Watch and neckband earphones, but a smartphone changes the equation for the sub-brand and brings it closer to the big rivals. So, what does the CMF Phone 1 promise for the market and where and how could Nothing make it relevant and popular among the buyers. Here’s a round-up of what we know. CMF Phone 1 launch is on July 8 and India will be a core market for this launch. Earlier reports claim the CMF Phone 1 will be launching for around Rs 12,000 which is a good Rs 10,000 cheaper than the Phone 2a but those details are far from being the reality. In fact, the CMF Phone 1 launch price is expected to be closer to Rs 19,000. It is also said that the CMF Phone 1 will be powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 7000-series chipset, most likely the Dimensity 7300 unit. The device is tipped to feature an OLED FHD+ display with 120Hz refresh rate. Recent leaks hint at a dual rear camera system but the sensor details are missing for now. Nothing could make the product appealing by serving the clean and fluid Nothing OS version on the CMF Phone 1 as well. We assume the phone will get a large size battery that could support 33W wired charging speed. Nothing is likely to continue its no-charger-in-the-box mantra for the CMF Phone 1 as well. Nothing will also have two more products lining up with the CMF Phone 1, one of them is said to be smartwatch and the other will be wireless earbuds."

Meta has been testing the AI chatbot with a wide range of users over the past few months but now it is finally coming to all these Meta-owned platforms. “You can use Meta AI in feed, chats and more across our apps to get things done, create content, and deep dive on topics, without having to leave the app you’re using,” Meta highlights the ability of the AI chatbot built using its Llama 3 language model. Meta knows that millions of users are on its platforms using their smartphones but even then, it hasn’t forgotten supporting Meta AI chatbot on the desktop. “When you’re trying to get things done at your computer, visit meta.ai. Need advice on a maths problem, help making an email sound more professional, Meta AI can help here too,” the company adds. We have got a preview of the Meta AI chatbot with WhatsApp earlier and the company’s full rollout is the extension of the same to its other platforms. For instance, if you use Facebook a lot, the Meta AI will be available on the feed itself where you can ask Meta AI about a particular place, or even seek recommendations for the best time to visit the country or a historical monument. WhatsApp Groups become a critical part of the Meta AI release, where you can browse through restaurant options, and even get a holiday trip planned and organised by Meta AI. That’s not all, like every AI model, Meta AI uses the LLM to help you generate AI images based on prompts and descriptions given by the user. The text-to-image generation can happen using prompts like, cat flying in a spaceship with a rat and dog. Meta AI will create the image in seconds. The company claims Llama 3 is its most-advanced LLM till date and it seems confident enough to bring it for everyone, especially in a market like India where you have more than 400 million daily active WhatsApp users."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Buzz Staff Trending Desk Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 09:00 IST Delhi, India ChatGPT-like technology will help enhance communication skills. (Representative Image) The market for human-sized sex dolls has been expanding for quite some time now. However, the advancement of large language models has ushered in new developments in the sex-bot market and it appears that China is pioneering in the field. Many Chinese companies are employing ChatGPT-like technology in sex robots to develop extended conversational abilities, both vocal and in terms of “body language”. Starpery Technology, a major producer of sex dolls, used their own large language model to enhance their sex dolls. These dolls, available in male and female models, will hit the shelves as soon as August. Other Chinese companies like WMdoll and EXdoll also plan to launch similar products. In a conversation with the South China Morning Post, Starpery Technology CEO Evan Lee said, “The new generation of sex dolls, powered by AI models and equipped with sensors, can react with both movements and speech, significantly enhancing user experience by focusing on emotional connection rather than just basic conversational abilities.” Traditional sex dolls are supported by a metal skeleton and have a silicone exterior. These robots have simple responses and lack expressions. Another development in China’s sex doll market is that companies are now focusing on the domestic market by making dolls that cater to Chinese beauty standards. Reportedly, despite having conservative social values, sex doll sales in China are more than collective sales in several Western countries. What makes China a pioneer in the sex robot market is not just their early adoption of new technology but also an effective supply chain. According to the South China Morning Post, a sex doll from Chinese brand Starpery is priced at $1,500 (approximately Rs 1.2 lakh), while a similar doll produced by Abyss Creations in the United States starts at $6,000 (approximately Rs 5 lakh). Evan Lee described the low-cost manufacturing advantage and said, “The supply chain in Guangdong is complete, and manufacturers respond quickly to market demands. New technologies can usually be seen in products, the following month it shows up somewhere else.” There are many ethical considerations that crop up around the humanoid robot industry. Many believe that AI-driven sex robots can reinforce harmful attitudes regarding consent and propagate negative gender stereotypes. Another criticism is that many people can be further isolated from society as they become overly dependent on AI companions for emotional and sexual fulfilment."

(Photo Credits: YouTube) Millions of webpages, databases and servers operate around the clock over the vast expanse of the Internet. The “visible\" Internet, also known as the surface web or open web, refers to websites that are easily accessed by search engines like Google and Yahoo. However, this is just the tip of the iceberg. So the question arises what completes the gigantic iceberg of the Internet? The answer is the Dark Web. Many of us link it to the unsettling areas of the internet where fraudsters and other criminals lurk. Ryan Montgomery, a renowned ethical hacker and cyber security expert, who has uncovered many internet predators in the past, shared some perspectives on the subject. He explained about the dark web and its activities in detail on the Shawn Ryan Show podcast. The ethical hacker clarified that the dark web actually isn’t an open black market, marketplace, or anything else that people usually expect it to be. Upon successfully connecting to the dark web, you still need to know the location of these “horrible websites.\" “Once you’re connected to the dark web you still need to know where to go to visit these horrible websites. Imagine a very long string of letters and numbers and the website instead of ‘.com’ it would be ‘.onion’,\" he said. As he puts it, you have to view such websites using the Onion Router—which you can download from the TOR website—instead of a standard browser. Ryan continues by explaining that you next need to visit something called the Hidden Wiki, which would display all the various types of websites along with links to them. He revealed that there are links to several sorts of websites, all of which are full of “horrible\" websites that “do horrible things.\" “There’s counterfeit money, there’s fake IDs,\" he said. The hacker claimed that while he has occasionally been forced to search the dark web for “predators and paedophiles,\" this is not always the case. Watch the video here: According to Ryan, these individuals frequently use their phone number, which can be traced back to them, their normal email address, or an IP address that has been used for several emails. They also sometimes use their face as their profile picture."

Using a dating app doesn’t guarantee finding a partner and individuals are often judged on various criteria. Dating can sometimes feel like job hunting with rejections causing emotional distress and potentially having long-lasting effects. However, instead of feeling heartbroken or angry, one can learn to manage rejections in a way that builds confidence. In a recent Reddit post, a user shared a valuable life hack for young men, encouraging them to use dating apps as a tool to learn an essential life lesson about handling rejection and failure for personal growth. The user explained, “Life hack for all young guys here. Use online dating apps. Not for the matches or finding a girlfriend. Dating apps will teach you very important life lesson, how to handle rejections and failure. Many years ago, I (28M) started using dating apps as a naive 21-year-old just out of college, after moving to Bengaluru for my first job. I had no idea what the online dating scene was like, so my expectations were high. The reality hit me very quickly, very hard. I don’t think I got a match for at least a month.” “I was expecting a match rate of 10-20%. The reality was 0.01% or even less. I tried making up excuses, making adjustments, but nothing changed much. I was so dejected and depressed. I uninstalled the apps, tried again after 3-4 months, only to get the same results. This cycle continued for 2-3 years, but each time I became more okay with my empty likes page,” the Redditor added. The individual shared that the most important lesson they learned from using dating apps is becoming comfortable with rejection. They noted that breakups happen and new opportunities are always available. Despite the mental stress, they found the real-world impact of these failures to be minimal. They considered this the best kind of failure and rejection one could experience. The Reddit user advised all young men to use online dating apps, experience numerous rejections, feel the sadness, and then learn how to deal with these failures and rejections, as it can prepare them for more serious setbacks later in life. Reacting to the post, a user wrote, “I already got rejected thrice IRL over the course of my life from high school to degree. I don’t need the app to know nobody wants me.” Another joked, “Protip: just prepare for UPSC and you’ll always be getting rejected.” “If you’re born in India and are not as privileged, you’re likely to know what rejection is and how to manage them from your early years,” a comment read. Another wrote, “This post seems like that 5 min life hack videos, where on the outside it looks like it’s studded with cherries and berries but on the inside it’s just shit.” An individual shared, “This post is like an entitled uncle giving you garbage life lessons you never asked for.” One more added, “Bro you said what I had in my mind. I wish more people understand and acknowledge the fact it’s a normal thing to get rejected.” Since the post was shared on Reddit, it has garnered over 800 upvotes."

(Photo Credits: Instagram) A donkey, who disappeared during a hike in California in 2019, has been found. Its owners, Terrie and David Drewry, feared the worst after weeks of searching near Cache Creek in Auburn. Their hopes were reignited unexpectedly recently when they stumbled upon a viral video on social media. The footage, captured by hunter Max Fennell during a hunting trip in March, showed a donkey peacefully chilling with a herd of wild elk. Calling it one of his “wildest hunting trips to date,” Max Fennel wrote, “I bumped into a herd of elk that have adopted a donkey. I can’t get over seeing it and I’m amazed that the donkey looks happy and healthy!” A post shared by Max Fennell (@maxfennell) The video shows the donkey grazing and moving alongside more than 10 elks. Terrie and David recognised distinct markings and behaviour and they were certain that the donkey was, in fact, their long-lost pet, Diesel. David Drewry commented under the video, “That is in fact, Diesel. He got away from me while packing out there 5 years ago. It was heartbreaking at the time. Glad to see he is helping the herd grow.” Terrie told CBS Sacramento that “it was amazing” seeing Diesel again. “It was like, oh my gosh. Finally, we saw him. Finally, we know he’s good. He’s living his best life. He’s happy. He’s healthy, and it was just a relief,” she said. The Drewry family adopted Diesel from the Bureau of Land Management. He lived on their ranch in Auburn, California, along with their llama, a miniature donkey named Jack, and some chickens. In April 2019, while out on a trail ride in the Cache Creek Wilderness with David and the llama, Diesel got scared and ran off, pulling David through bushes. Despite big search efforts using drones and people on horseback, Diesel was not found until 5 years later on March 31, when Max Fennell’s video showed him just a few miles from where he vanished. Terrie now believes Diesel has formed a bond with the elk family and possibly protects them from predators. Terrie explained to CBS that Diesel probably has defended the herd by taking down coyotes and potentially even a mountain lion. Despite being different species, Diesel and the elk have formed a close bond, functioning almost like a family. She also mentioned that bringing Diesel back now would be extremely difficult because he has fully adapted to living as a “wild burro.”"

    "article_content": "Curated By : Buzz Staff Trending Desk Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 17:00 IST Delhi, India The temperature rises with every ounce of coal, oil or gas that is ever burned. (Representative Image) Global warming is regarded as one of the most crucial anthropogenic challenges to the ecosystem. It intensifies the detrimental effects of other human-mediated issues while also having a direct impact on biodiversity. While there have been some severe heatwaves in a few countries, most of the world’s population will never encounter temperatures that are “too hot for people to live,” particularly those living in arid climates. Colorado State University Professor of Atmospheric Science Scott Denning throws light on the subject as a part of The Conversation’s Curious Kids series. A 12-year-old Idaho-based child posed a question in the series asking that his “parents said the planet is getting too hot for people to live here. They called it climate change. What does that mean?” Denning writes that carbon dioxide is produced when humans burn carbon, such as coal in a power plant or petrol in a vehicle. The accumulation of this invisible gas in the atmosphere traps solar heat close to the Earth’s surface. What we get as an outcome is climate change. The temperature rises with every ounce of coal, oil or gas that is ever burned. Denning notes that most of the time, when it’s hot outside in arid climates, our bodies can cool down by sweating. But occasionally, dangerously high temperatures and humidity can be found in some regions, particularly in scorching deserts that are close to warm ocean waters. According to him, sweating doesn’t cool us in humid air since sweating doesn’t evaporate as rapidly there. Denning notes that summer heat waves, combined with humid air coming in off the sea, may be fatal in certain locations of the Middle East, Pakistan and India. He continued, stating that to better understand this danger, scientists such as himself utilise wet bulb thermometers. By forcing ambient air over a moist cloth, a wet bulb thermometer facilitates the evaporation of water. Should the wet bulb’s temperature exceed 35 degrees Celsius, the human body will be unable to release adequate heat. Long-term exposure to this level of heat and humidity can be lethal. The professor continued by giving examples from the lower Mississippi Valley and Delhi. Wet bulb temperatures were quite high across the lower Mississippi Valley during a major heat wave in 2023, he added, albeit they didn’t become hazardously high. In Delhi, where air temperatures reached 49 degrees Celsius on several occasions in May 2024, wet bulb temperatures were dangerously near, and numerous individuals passed away from presumed heatstroke. There are many more issues caused by climate change than merely hot weather. According to Denning, heated air evaporates water much more readily, causing certain regions’ crops, woods and landscapes to dry up and become more prone to wildfires. Additionally, warming causes ocean water to expand, which increases the risk of coastal flooding. Denning points out that by 2100, rising sea levels might force up to 2 billion people to migrate elsewhere. He goes on to say that the world economy is threatened by climate change because of all these effects. According to Denning’s prediction, if coal, oil, and gas continue to be used, world incomes might be reduced by around 25% by the end of the century."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Buzz Staff Trending Desk Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 18:00 IST Delhi, India The Reddit user said the incident shaped her perception of the city. (Representative Image) Gig workers like Rapido drivers often endure gruelling work schedules and inadequate pay. One might assume they seldom have the energy to go beyond their duties, particularly when it involves turning down rightfully earned income. Yet, for some compassionate souls, generosity flows effortlessly, regardless of the situation. A recent Reddit post highlighting one such considerate Rapido driver is gaining significant appreciation. On Friday, a Reddit user recounted how she stumbled and fell while walking home from the office, injuring herself. Despite someone witnessing her fall and laughing, they didn’t offer help and moved on. Distressed, the user booked a Rapido ride, and within five minutes, the driver arrived. Observing her condition, the driver expressed concern and learned about her internship during the journey. When the woman tried to give the driver money, he refused because she was still just an intern. The Reddit user wrote, “I kept insisting but he said ‘when you get your own money then give it to someone who needs it. I try doing one good thing everyday, you are that for me.’” She added that this incident occurred during her second week in Bengaluru and it has shaped her perspective of the city. She concluded the post with, “Kind Rapido Man, I hope all the good things happen to you. I hope life is easier and happier for you. I wish all the good things for you.” This post has gathered over 1,300 upvotes in just one day. Many people urged the Reddit user to reveal the details of the Rapido driver so they could openly express their appreciation for him. Someone wrote, “Please pass the name and number of the kind driver. You can DM too, OP. Time for us to reward the kind guy.” Another person suggested, “Hey OP please make a LinkedIn post on this, I’ve seen Rapido respond to these and I think they recognise the efforts of riders that go beyond what’s expected.” Many people also asked the girl to get a precautionary tetanus shot because she had fallen into a drain. A Reddit user recalled, “These things keep my faith in humanity. Reminds me of a time when a kind stranger offered me a lift on his scooter when he saw me walking with a heavy suitcase. Could not book a cab/auto as my phone had died. I hope I can pass on the good deed, and I hope you do too.” Another person wrote, “Every place has good and bad people. You happened to meet the good one this time. Keep smiling and sharing positive energy and you will happen to meet more of the good ones.”"

(Photo Credits: X) Students from across the country, who had travelled to various cities for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test Postgraduate (NEET-PG) 2024 scheduled for June 23, were left dismayed when the exam was unexpectedly cancelled just a few hours before its commencement. The last-minute decision sparked widespread frustration among candidates, many of whom had dedicated months of preparation. In response to the abrupt cancellation, many students voiced their discontent and criticised the authorities. A video now doing rounds online features a student condemning the Ministry of Education for “ruining the lives of young students”. “I Just found out that the NEET PG examination that was supposed to be conducted tomorrow, at 9:30 AM just got postponed and the circular for the postponement was released 15 minutes ago which means it was less than 12 hours before the actual paper was supposed to be conducted. Are the people in the Ministry of Education even eligible to make such decisions? Are they even eligible to be in that position of power and change and make policies that will ruin people’s lives like this? Do you not think before doing such things? You are trying to protect the integrity and sanctity of the examination, by stopping it 12 hours before the paper,” the student said. “What did you do when you were releasing the admit cards? The NEET UG controversy was going on even then, what stopped you then and why are you doing it now, what point are you trying to prove here? These are doctors, these are not small kids, they’re writing an exam to stay in this very country that you are ruining with their policies and then you have the audacity to ask everybody, ‘Why is everyone leaving the country?

Due to science and technology, many things happen in our lives that people would not have imagined say a century ago. For example, flying in the sky was once a fantasy, but today, it is no longer a big deal. People take flights to cover the distance that they used to cover by rickshaw or on foot. Usually, we prefer to travel by aeroplane for long distances. Today, we are going to talk about the world’s shortest air travel. But the flight we will tell you about covers a distance of just 2.7 kilometres, that too in 1 or 2 minutes. The flight between the Scottish islands of Westray and Papa Westray holds the world record for the shortest commercial flight. The plane is usually in the air for just under 2 minutes. The name of this commercial flight is also recorded in the world record, which ends as soon as it starts. Papa Westray holds the record for having the shortest flight in the world. This plane is a commercial flight, which starts and ends within just two minutes. Most of us travel by car, bus, or on foot for short trips like the distance of 1.7 miles, i.e., 2.7 kilometres but for those living in the islands of northern Scotland, this distance is covered by aeroplane. A Britten-Norman Islander, a small aircraft with only eight seats and only one pilot is used to transport passengers. This flight between Orkney Islands and Westray usually takes 90 seconds, but if the weather is not favourable, then it can take 2 or 3 minutes. This distance can also be covered by ferry from Orkney Islands, but this is not always possible when the water level rises. In such a situation, people take aeroplanes for this short distance. This flight first started in 1967 and has been running like this ever since. For this, the Scottish government has also kept subsidised tickets, which cost around Rs 2,000 to Rs 4,700."

The series is set twenty years into the pandemic caused by a mass fungal infection, which turns people into zombies. Half of humanity wipes out with time. Arturo Casadevall, a professor of molecular microbiology, immunology and infectious diseases, claimed in an interview that the epidemic shown in The Last Of Us is not a mere fantasy and says that Fungi pose a ‘real threat’ to humanity. The fungal virus is called Cordyceps. People infected by it turn into zombie-like creatures whose bites or fine spores infect humans, turning them into monsters. Professor Arturo Casadevall warns people of the Fungi Epidemic in his latest book titled What If Fungi Win? It was published last month. “Right now, we don’t know any fungi that can turn a human into a zombie. But there’s no question in my mind that we are likely to see dangerous new fungal pathogens emerge over time. In fact, we’ve already seen it happen,” said Professor Arturo Casadevall. Casadevall believes that due to climate change, fungi are likely to spread ‘new diseases’ to mankind. He said that there is growing evidence that some fungi have the potential to spread new diseases that will harm humans in an unprecedented way. The fungus or fungal organisms only need to be able to adapt to higher temperatures, he added. Currently, most such organisms cannot survive in temperatures above 37 degrees Celsius. But this limit can be broken, Professor claims. In his latest book, What If Fungi Win, the professor presented evidence of fungi mutating after the fungus Candida auris was found in the ear of a person in Japan in 2007. It further spread to South America, Africa and India. “Candida auris was unknown to medicine until 2007 when it was recovered from the ear of an individual in Japan. So we have a medical mystery. We have an organism that medicine didn’t know anything about. One of the things we have proposed is that this may have been the first fungus to breach our thermal barriers,” said Professor Arturo Casadevall. He warns humans of a possible fungal epidemic and says that humanity may not have suffered this disease but many other species have been through the same."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Buzz Staff Local News Desk Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 10:43 IST Delhi, India The filter protects employees from the angry voices of customers. Have you ever been screamed at for no fault of yours? Are you employed in a job where you have to bear the brunt of hearing your clients shout all the time? Call centre employees have it hard, having to deal with angry clients most of the time, which can affect their mental peace. However, artificial intelligence (AI) has a remedy for almost everything these days and this is no exception. A Japanese multinational company has developed an artificial intelligence filter that can detect angry screams and translate them into calm speech to reduce the stress experienced by call centre operators. Large tech companies have recognised the daily stress experienced by their call centre operators, who often bear the brunt of customers’ anger and frustrations. To address this, some companies have implemented stress management programmes featuring relaxation techniques, meditation, yoga, or therapy to alleviate irritability and anxiety. However, a Japanese company named SoftBank might have found a more effective solution by using AI to remove screaming and aggressive speech from the interactions. SoftBank asserts that they have spent three years developing a voice filter capable of detecting and converting screams into calm speech. Toshiyuki Nakatani, one of the developers at SoftBank, said, “We have developed an emotion suppression system that will protect the employees from the angry voices of customers that distress them.” SoftBank’s voice filter works through a two-step process. Initially, the AI detects an angry voice and identifies key speech elements. In the next step, it employs acoustic tools to convert the speech into a more natural and polite tone. Importantly, the filter does not modify the words spoken, but it softens the intonation significantly. This means that call centre operators will still hear any insults, but in a gentler tone, which is intended to help reduce their stress and anxiety. To train the AI, SoftBank’s engineers had 10 actors record at least 100 common phrases, including screams, accusations, threats and demands for apologies. In total, over 10,000 voice recordings were used to develop the AI filter."

Everyone is busy scrolling through their social media feeds and watching viral videos these days. Puzzles are also a popular way to keep online communities engaged and entertained. They are a great way to pass the time because they are fun, challenging, and keep you racking your brain until the answer is staring you in the face and you finally understand it. The internet is full of all kinds of puzzles that you can spend hours on, pondering the clues and solving problems. These little brain teasers make you feel stupid when you can’t solve them, and then you get angry when someone finally tells you the obvious answer. This riddle that surprised people was posted on the forum of X from the Daily Quiz and Riddles account. This riddle requires a simple task. You have to count the circles you see in the picture. The photo shows three large circles in the middle with text written on them: “How many circles do you see? Think about it!!!” At first glance, you might think that the answer is three. There are three large circles in the middle of the picture. Each circle intersects the other, but the shapes created by these intersections are not circles and therefore do not count. To solve this puzzle correctly, keen observation is required. You need to read the question again slowly and see if you missed anything. Is there a hidden clue in the question that you can’t decipher? Let's see if anyone would get this correctly! pic.twitter.com/5rQmi9u6KZ — Daily Quiz and Riddles (@quiz_riddles) June 19, 2024 According to the X account, there are 14 circles hidden in the post. This is not just the obvious trio of large circles, you also have to count the hidden circles in the text. The post claims that letters like “o”, “e”, “a” and “d” are part of a group of circles. With 11 of these letter circles and three large circles, you get the magic number 14. There are 14 circles in this image. Do you see all?👀 https://t.co/AMLCcpwII4 — Daily Quiz and Riddles (@quiz_riddles) June 20, 2024 Some observant users did not accept this and argued about whether the word “circle” itself should be counted as a large round structure. Then some people believe that the part between “E” and “A” does not completely cut through the sphere."

Since childhood, we have been exposed to tragic stories of love, where the lovers go to such lengths to be with each other. However, after hearing about a 39-year-old Brazilian woman’s love story, you would think love is not limited to humans or animals. The woman named Meirivione Rocha Moraes, is married to a rag doll, called Marcelo, made by her mother. Meirivione has been making headlines for her bizarre relationship since last year, interestingly also sharing three “children” with it. According to her, she fell in love with Marcelo at first sight, and after marrying each other, their lives were going normal and her familial life was just like any other family. But despite being a doll, Marcelo could not stop himself from committing infidelity, the wife revealed in the show La Vida Sin Filtros. Unsurprisingly, Meirivione ended up forgiving him because she loved him so much. She stated on the show that their relationship and their daily lives do not differ from any other family, just that Marcelo is disabled. She said, “Marcelo is disabled, he has no feet, Marcelinho (their son) is a dwarf and the girls are also suspected of dwarfism.” Meirivione Rocha Moraes and Marcelo tied the knot in December 2021, and the ceremony was attended by over 250 guests, according to the Daily Star. Meirivione likes to dress her rag-doll husband in men’s clothes, as they go on romantic dates and outings frequently. As a social media frequent, the woman has captured all her moments with Marcello on their Instagram page, followed by thousands of users. There she revealed that Marcello recently got a tattoo of their children’s names. Shockingly, she even mentioned a disturbing plan to kidnap their son Marcelinho, which thankfully ended up failing. As per more reports, she provided details on the “birth” of their twin daughters, Emilia and Marcela. She claimed that they were delivered at a clinic. Even though Meirivione’s situation makes netizens believe that she may be going through a mental illness, she continues to travel with her family, by keeping them safe in a suitcase."

(Representative Image) Financial services platform Groww faced controversy when a consumer alleged on social media that an investment made through its app was fraudulent. According to the user, he invested in the Parag Parikh Mutual Fund via Groww in 2020. However, subsequent efforts to redeem the money indicated that no investment had been placed in the fund business. Facing a significant backlash, the platform provided an explanation and offered a refund to the consumer. Taking to social media platform X (formerly Twitter), a customer accused the firm of fraud. Posting screenshots of the complainant’s allegations, it was claimed that the app produced a folio and showed an updated amount of growth when the money was initially invested. The user’s attempt to redeem the investment revealed the problem. The folio number was allegedly reported as nonexistent by the mutual fund where the investment was placed. When the consumer got in touch with Groww, customer support representatives said the money was “never invested correctly” and that all information had been “removed” from the dashboard. The user expressed dissatisfaction by asking, “Where is the money? You can not just wipe a Record and say the issue is sorted.” New fear unlocked.Mutual fund platform took money but investment was never made pic.twitter.com/caUPBAGGCp — Finance Memes (@Qid_Memez) June 23, 2024 Groww responded to these grave charges with a statement outlining its stance.

We have investigated the matter and we can assure that the customer did not make any investment.— Groww (@_groww) June 23, 2024 Another user raised concerns about Groww’s response, questioning whether the money had been withdrawn from their account, where it went, or if any deduction had occurred at all. What do you mean the customer did not make the investment? I assume here you are operating as an EOP only…if the money was deducted (usually a recurring standing request to the users bank acc) where did the money go? Or the money was never deducted from the users bank acc?— Nitin Kavade (@KavadeNitin) June 23, 2024 Groww said that the funds were “never deducted” from the client’s bank account in this instance. No, the money was never deducted from the bank account of the customer in the said matter.— Groww (@_groww) June 23, 2024 In response to one of these postings on X, Groww confirmed that “the customer’s dashboard erroneously reflected a folio,” but added that no transaction occurred and no money was withdrawn from the customer’s account. pic.twitter.com/wweDbwwjqU — Groww (@_groww) June 23, 2024 Another user then responded, sharing a screenshot of the complainant’s most recent update on the situation. The complaint posted an update on LinkedIn, stating that after several conversations and discussions, Groww has admitted to the error of producing an invalid entry and the incorrect folio. The investing business ultimately opted to reimburse the consumer for the disputed amount. Then what is this? pic.twitter.com/IpIdu18yaa — Rohan Das (@rohaninvestor) June 23, 2024 The company, however, asserted that it had returned the funds to the client’s account in “good faith” and requested a copy of the bank statement demonstrating the amount that had been deducted at the time the transaction was made. To ensure that the investor doesn’t get anxious about the claimed amount, we have credited it to the investor on good faith basis. We have also asked the investor to provide the bank statement evidencing the debit of the said amount, claimed to have been invested. This will…— Groww (@_groww) June 23, 2024 Groww, in a more detailed response on X following the online outrage, stated the following: “A social media post by a customer’s relative is being shared, which is spreading misinformation. We’d like to clear the air about the said claim. A Groww customer reported on June 19, 2024, that she was unable to redeem a Mutual Fund Investment. Upon investigation, we found that the customer’s account was showing an incorrect investment due to a recon issue. The customer never made this investment, and no money was deducted from her bank account. We deeply regret the reporting error and have resolved the Issue,” before adding, “We have been in constant touch with the customer, supporting them with all necessary information. We’d like to assure all our customers that their Mutual Fund investments are safe on Groww. We have always worked towards investor protection and will continue to do so. Our customer support team is available 24/7 to help you whenever you have a query.” pic.twitter.com/dr5pKN2jou — Groww (@_groww) June 24, 2024 Users, meanwhile, voiced scepticism over the company’s conduct."

Gambling is essentially a game of chance with no guarantees of winning. However, it seems that having divine intervention can greatly enhance one’s earning potential. This belief has led a series of casinos in Zimbabwe, South Africa, to ban a man who claims to be a prophet from entering their premises. Archbishop Emmanuel Mutumwa has reportedly been barred from nearly every casino in the area. Casino operators fear that, as God’s purported chosen gambler, he could potentially cause significant financial losses for their establishments and put them out of business. The holy man, who is the leader of the Johanne Masowe eChishanu Apostolic Sect, managed to win Rs 25 lakh at a casino and boldly claimed that the winning numbers had been foretold to him through a vision from God himself. But his celebration was cut short when the owner of other casinos in Zimbabwe asked him to stay away due to fear. They believe Archbishop Emmanuel Mutumwa has an ‘unfair advantage’ in the form of visions from God. Archbishop Mutumwa, who shares videos of his religious services on YouTube, where he has 1.3k subscribers, believes the ban is entirely unjust and is incredulous that his run of luck has been abruptly ended. The archbishop also took a dig at critics of gambling. “God works in mysterious ways. This win was not about luck, but a test of faith,” he said. “I prayed for guidance and the Lord provided the numbers through a vision. Isn’t it a blessing to use these winnings to uplift my congregation?” Archbishop Emmanuel Mutumwa stated that he used the winnings to pay school fees for some of his church members and to provide start-up funds for businesses. A local casino manager explained that betting establishments often restrict or close the accounts of individuals who win frequently. It is not yet clear whether Mutumwa will pursue legal action against the casinos’ decision."

Optical illusions are known to trick our eyes and often go viral online. These images, including patterns, sketches, colourful displays, or creatively crafted text, often evoke fascination among users. Recently, a picture of a number pool went viral, where you had to find two similar numbers. Are you ready to take on the challenge? This task is not easy at all, and the time limit of 8 seconds is making it even more difficult. Look at the picture carefully. You will see that different numbers are written in small and big boxes of different colours. Wherever you look, a new number is written. So, you have to find a number among them, which is in pairs; that is, it is written twice in this picture. You have only 8 seconds to complete this challenge. Take a look at the photo: Hint It is not that it is difficult to find the number, but the eyes get confused seeing the bright colours. If you are not able to find it, then the hint is that one number is written above, and at another, it is written a little below on the right-hand side. Answer If you have been able to complete the challenge within 8 seconds, then congratulations, but if you are still struggling, then you can see the answer in the picture. The number is 32. One is placed on the upper side in a yellow box. The other one is seen a little below in a blue box on the right-hand side. You can see the answer in the white circle. Earlier, a similar puzzle went viral on an Instagram account named Brain Teaser Hub. In the viral image, there were a lot of typed numbers in a dot-shaped size. The users are required to search for a concealed number 8 among these dots in 8 seconds."

(Photo Credits: Instagram) The National Aeronautical Space Administration (NASA) has been at the forefront of sharing with us some fascinating images and videos of Earth and space. Recently, NASA shared a stunning picture of the ‘Phobos’, one of the two moons of Mars. One of the highlights of the rare picture is that the moon appears to be like a potato. The moon is being referred to as ‘Space Potato’ due to its unique shape and texture. In the caption, NASA wrote, “Phobos is the larger of Mars’ two moons, but it’s still only about 17 x 14 x 11 miles (27 by 22 by 18 kilometres) in diameter. Because Phobos is so small, its gravity isn’t strong enough to pull it into a sphere (like Earth’s Moon), giving it its lumpy shape.” Sharing the picture of the moon, the space organisation highlighted the potential collision between the planet and Phobos. They revealed that Phobos has been travelling towards Mars at a rate of six feet (1.8 metres) every hundred years. This can result in a possible collision in 50 million years and can break the planet into a ring. The space agency said that the image was taken by the HiRISE camera aboard its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft. After sharing the picture, it instantly went viral on social media, with people sharing their views in the comment section. One of the users wrote, “Finally, we found a potato in space.” Another user commented, “Can we please turn it into space fries?” So far, the picture of Phobos has garnered more than 4 lakh likes on Instagram. A post shared by NASA (@nasa) Talking about Phobos, NASA has revealed that it doesn’t have its atmosphere and that it orbits around Mars three times a day. The other moon of the Red Planet is called Deimos."

The internet has become a popular platform where people perform various actions to become famous. Several videos keep going viral on social media every day. Some of these are very useless and people cannot even understand why such videos are made. Many of these are shared while performing dangerous stunts. Unfortunately, such videos can result in serious accidents. One such video is going viral on the internet. You must have often seen boys performing strange stunts, but in the video that is going viral, two girls are performing stunts together on the road. The recent incident serves as a reminder of the dangers associated with performing such stunts. Some people express their concern, while others say that this is stupidity. In the clip, you can see the two girls performing stunts together on the road. Both of them are school students, as they are wearing school uniforms. One girl stands and the other climbs on her shoulders and does a backflip in the air. This was fine, but instead of landing on her feet, the girl fell straight on the road. She gets hurt so badly that she is not able to even stand up again. A post shared by Shalu Kirar (@shalugymnast) The video has been shared on Instagram with a caption that read, “Waist broke.” The clip was shared in February and received more than 17 lakh views on the social media platform. Comments on the post express concern towards the girls, while some highlight the consequences of such actions. One user wrote, “Please be careful not to do it on the road.” Another said, “It’s good that they’re sharing it for other little girls to learn not to do this at a place like this. Girls can be silly; I hope she’s okay.” The third one wrote, “Don’t try this, the road is not safe.”"

Whether it is about the delicious street food or the vibrant nightlife, Delhiites and Mumbaikars often argue about which city is superior. But amid this rivalry, there is one thing they both face – the never-ending traffic jams. This time, the focus is on the financial capital of India, Mumbai. Entrepreneur Bhaumik Gowande’s recent social media post underlined the traffic woes in the city, leading to a discussion in the online community. Gowande recently shared his experience on X (formerly Twitter), detailing his encounter with Mumbai’s traffic upon leaving the airport premises. In the post, he recounted that despite arriving at the airport at around 7:15, it took nearly one hour for him to move just 600 meters from the airport exit. “Landing in Mumbai after living in New Delhi & just coming outside Airport gives me the Third World Ick.

Caught in a candid moment by the camera, Modi’s presence at Vijay Mallya’s opulent estate in Hertfordshire added an intriguing twist to the festivities. Amidst the lavish affair blending Christian and Hindu ceremonies, the sight of Modi and Mallya together sparked a flurry of memes and jests, given their shared legal entanglements. Mallya, facing charges of loan fraud exceeding Rs. 900 crore, and Modi, embroiled in allegations of tax evasion and money laundering, seemed an unlikely duo amidst the celebration.

(Photo Credits: X) There is a wide variety of chocolate available across the world. Some popular ones include Cadbury, Hershey, Toblerone, Lindt and Ferrero Rocher. People with a sweet tooth relish the smooth and rich texture of chocolates. But, chances are that you will not find someone keen enough to trace back the origin of a chocolate brand. That was, however, not the case for a social media user who was so intrigued by the name of a particular chocolate that he unearthed the history behind it. Recently, an X-user shared some information about a Dutch-based chocolate bar named Tony’s Chcolonely on the micro-blogging platform. Intrigued by its melancholic name, he searched about its history and came upon an interesting revelation. “My curiosity piqued by the oddly melancholic name of the chocolate bar I bought at Schiphol Airport, I went in search of backstory. I was not expecting this,” he wrote. In a detailed screenshot posted on X, the user revealed that Tony’s Chcolonely was founded by Dutch television producer Teun van de Keuken. He was on a mission to eradicate slavery. But upon finding himself alone in the noble pursuit, he felt “lonely”. This prompted him to launch the chocolate company that echoed his gloomy sentiment.

The brand was called Tony’s Chocolonely with “Tony” (Teun) and “Chocolonely” in reference to Teun van de Keuken’s feeling as if he was the only person in the industry who was interested in eradicating slavery. Van de Keuken sold 20,000 bars in two days,” read the text. The internet population was quick to react to the post. “You know I’ve eaten about 100 of these over the years and I always thought the name was Tony Chocoloney, like a fun rhyming name. I knew that the backstory, can’t believe I misread that name for so long,” shared an individual. “It’s also the most delicious chocolate in the world possibly,” commented a chocolate lover. “And honestly?

    "article_content": "Curated By : Buzz Staff Trending Desk Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 14:13 IST Delhi, India The passenger felt guilt after his complaint led to a salary cut. (Representative Image) The Rail Madad application by Indian Railways serves as a platform for passengers to address their grievances regarding service delivery. Users can easily file complaints against any shortcomings in the services provided. However, a recent post by a passenger claimed that his complaint via the app resulted in disciplinary action against a railway official and train attendant, leading to their salary cut. In his post, a Reddit user shared his initial experience using the Rail Madad app during a train journey. He recounted how he filed a complaint through the app after not receiving a pillow, only to later find out that another passenger had taken an extra pillow, and the attendant was not at fault. However, he learned that as a consequence of his complaint, both the railway official and the attendant faced penalties in the form of a salary cut. “Today I tried the rail madad app for the first time while travelling in a train. I had complaint for not getting a pillow. It was later known that a fellow passenger had taken double pillow and it was not the fault of the attendant. Now, the attendant and railway official have informed me that now they will be penalised in form of a salary cut,” he wrote on Reddit. Expressing regret, he apologised for unknowingly causing severe consequences and advised others to first communicate with the attendant before filing a complaint on the Rail Madad app. “I immediately apologised as I didn’t know that this could result in such severe measure for them. I would want people to first cross-check with the attendant for any issue you might be facing before using the rail madad app. Keep it as a last option,” he added. See the post here: As the user grappled with regret over his complaint, many online users speculated that the railway official and the attendant might have been trying to make him feel guilty so he wouldn’t complain in the future. One user remarked, “They are giving you a guilt trip. The salary won’t be deducted but they should resolve the complaint otherwise their head will be liable to answer to authorities.” Another chimed in, “The attendant is making sure that you feel guilty enough so that you won’t trouble him for anything else during your travel and he can laze around more.” Yet, one comment stated, “They won’t cut any salary. You were being guilt-tripped. The attendants are supposed to hand you your pillow and fresh sheets when you board.” Someone added, “Salary cuts nahi hoti bhai (Salary cuts doesn’t happen brother). It’s a government job.” After reading the post, a user declared, “I would suggest that you are being guilt trapped.” What are your views?"

However, as companies increasingly eliminate the WFH option, employees are left with no choice but to accept the change. Yet, one Redditor’s straightforward response to his company’s ‘no work from home’ rule has sparked widespread discussion online, impressing many. Posting on the ‘Anti Work’ subreddit, a Redditor shared how their job insisted there would be no work from home “at all,” even during a snowstorm. “Even though I work in IT and do everything remotely, they want me in the office,” the original poster (OP) wrote. In response, the Redditor decided to be equally direct with the company, mirroring their rigid stance.

He asked why today and I explained what I was told,” the Redditor recounted. They concluded with a simple yet powerful statement: “I am not allowed to work from home.” An ‘X’ user soon took a screenshot of the Reddit post and shared it on the platform with the caption, “Seems fair to me.” Seems fair to me. pic.twitter.com/Vae9wkhXCM — BladeoftheSun (@BladeoftheS) June 22, 2024 The post quickly went viral, eliciting a range of reactions from the public. “Good point. Have you noticed how they grimace when you ask to work from home, but when they need you on a support rota, you’re suddenly able to do the most important work from anywhere?” one commenter noted. Another agreed, “Exactly. No “have your cake and eat it too”. If no work from home then my personal phone is off limits.” Others shared the perks of working from home. One user commented, “I work from home, it’s great. I’m more productive, happier and don’t have to waste 2 hours a day, 10 hours week or 40 -odd a month commuting. It’s a an absolute no-brainer. If I ever see an office again it’ll be too soon!” Also Read: This Boss Demands Sick Leave For 8-Minute Washroom Break, We Read That Right Another added, “I wfh and it’s great.

(Photo Credit: X) A US woman was shocked to discover that a $3.99 (Rs 333) vase she purchased a few years ago from a thrift store was actually a Mayan artefact. Anne Lee Dozier, from Washington, DC, safely returned the 1,200-year-old artefact to its native Mexico. In recognition of her efforts to restore this “historic gem” to its homeland, she was thanked by the Mexican embassy. The embassy expressed gratitude to Dozier in Spanish, saying, “Thanks to the generosity of Anne Lee Dozier, a US citizen, we recovered a classical vessel, dated between 200 and 800 AD.” Additionally, they said that the “historical gem will be reintegrated” into the National Institute of Anthropology and History of Mexico.

Anne Lee Dozier went on to say that she chose to purchase the item since it stood out from the other things on the shelf. In fact, Anne could tell the vase was clearly from Mexico because she frequently visits there for work. Although Anne didn’t think the vase would be this historical, she informed the news source that she believed it to be between twenty and thirty years old. After visiting the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City for business in January, Dozier—who works for the human rights organisation Christian Solidarity Worldwide—said something snapped. Anne Lee Dozier realised that several items she was browsing through looked strikingly similar to those she already owned. Suspecting she had a cultural artefact, Anne asked a museum staff member what steps to take. Dozier told the radio station that the employee advised her to get in touch with the Mexican embassy upon her return to the USA. An official from the Mexican embassy, Sergio Aguirre Gamboa, informed the outlet that a protocol had been set up specifically for situations like this in 2021. Its goal is to stop the selling of archaeological artefacts from Mexico and to foster communication with private organisations and museums in order to restore their cultural heritage. According to him, Dozier provided images and details about the vase to the embassy, who subsequently forwarded them to Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History for verification. The vase was identified by experts as an artefact from the Mayan Classic Period, which was created in what is now Southeast Mexico between 200 and 800 A.D. Dozier stated that officials contacted her in April, stating that “it is real” and requesting its return. After wrapping the vase in a food delivery box stuffed with newspapers, Dozier headed to the Mexican Cultural Institute located in Washington, D.C. She returned the vessel to the Mexican ambassador in a ceremony."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Rohit News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 15:12 IST New Delhi, India The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on March 21, could have walked out of Tihar jail on Friday. (Image: AAP/YouTube) The Supreme Court on Monday described the Delhi High Court’s decision to grant an interim stay on bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the money laundering case without issuing a final order as “unusual.” This remark came as the top court fixed June 26 for Kejriwal’s plea against the Delhi HC order. “In stay matters, judgments are not reserved but passed on the spot. What has happened here is unusual,” the apex court was quoted as saying by the Bar and Bench . A vacation bench of Justices Manoj Misra and SVN Bhatti said it would like to wait for the pronouncement of the high court order on the matter. “Orders on stay application was reserved and till then the lower court order granting bail was stayed. Parties were given the opportunity to file short submissions by June 24. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) says order on stay application will be passed shortly and this requests for an adjournment. We deem it appropriate that the case be listed day after and if High Court passes an order meanwhile the let that be brought on record,” the court ordered. Senior Advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for Kejriwal, sought vacating of the interim stay on the bail order. Stating that Kejriwal is not a flight risk, Singhvi urged the bench to stay the high court order before it is being pronounced. “I know what I am asking. This court must stay the high court order before it is being pronounced just like the high court had stayed the bail order on mere mentioning by the Enforcement Directorate,” he submitted. ASG SV Raju, appearing for the ED, opposed the plea of Kejriwal, and said the high court is about to pronounce the verdict on its stay application. The bench noted that the high court had on June 21 asked the parties to file written submissions till June 24 and observed that the order is likely to be pronounced in a day or two. Justice Misra, however, observed that the stay order is normally pronounced the same day and not reserved. “It’s unusual,” he observed and added that the court would like to wait for the high court order to get the clear picture on the issue. The bench at the outset told Singhvi that pronouncing any order at this stage would be prejudging the issue. “We will be pre-judging the issue, if we pass any order at this stage. It is not some other court but the high court,” the bench told Singhvi. The high court had on Friday paused Kejriwal’s release after the trial court granted him bail on June 20. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on March 21, could have walked out of Tihar jail on Friday last had the high court not granted the interim stay relief to the federal anti-money laundering agency. In its bail order, the trial court had held that prima facie, Kejriwal’s guilt was yet to be established and that the ED had failed to furnish direct evidence linking him to the proceeds of crime in the money laundering case. The excise policy was scrapped in 2022 after the Delhi lieutenant governor ordered a CBI probe into alleged irregularities and corruption involving its formulation and execution. According to the ED and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), irregularities were committed while modifying the policy and undue favours extended to the licence holders."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Riya Ashok Madayi News18.com Last Updated: May 28, 2024, 12:39 IST Mumbai, India 'Letters of Suresh', directed by Feroz Abbas Khan and written by Rajiv Joseph features Vir Hirani and Palomi Ghosh and delves into deep subjects using an epistolary style. Following a highly anticipated theatrical production, noted theatre director Feroz Abbas Khan and playwright Rajiv Joseph collaborated on their most recent stage project, ‘Letters of Suresh.’ The drama debuted recently at the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre (NMACC) in Mumbai, starring Vir Hirani, the renowned filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani’s son, and Palomi Ghosh. ‘Letters of Suresh’ explores deep issues of love, grief, and the pursuit of human connection via a sequence of moving letters that are exchanged between the characters. Popular works by Feroz Abbas Khan include ‘Mughal-e-Azam: The Musical,’ ‘Tumhari Amrita,’ and ‘Saalgirah.’ His collaboration with renowned playwright Rajiv Joseph, who is renowned for his perceptive storytelling, ensured that Indian audience absolutely had a moving and stirring experience. Here’s an excerpt from an exclusive chat with both the director and playwright with News18.com on all things about this wonderful collaboration. Excerpts from the interview with director Feroz Abbas Khan :- How did the collaboration with playwright Rajiv Joseph come about, and what drew you to direct Letters of Suresh? Rajiv Joseph has an incredible writing voice and ‘Letters of Suresh’ drew me instantly because it is a profound study of the human condition. It talks not only about existential loneliness but also about the infinitesimal ways, human-beings can connect with each other. We have all experienced loss, nostalgia, and grief, and also found hope in the unlikeliest of places. After the scale of ‘Mughal-e-Azam: The Musical’, the intimacy of the epistolary format also attracted me and made me reach out to Rajiv, who was incredibly generous and supportive ,the play will be seen by the Indian audiences for the very first time. It is such an evocative, poignant, layered and well-crafted play and I have thoroughly enjoyed the process of directing it. How will the themes of love, loss, and the search for connection in Letters of Suresh resonate with Indian audiences ? As I said before, the play is not just about four protagonists expressing their deepest longings through letters but about everyone who has felt alone and tried to find solace and connection. The nationalities of the characters and the audiences is not going to come in the way of the story’s capacity to move and stir emotions. The themes of love, loss, and the search for an answering echo are universal and no matter where the play is staged, it will resonate with the audience. A post shared by Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre (@nmacc.india) What challenges did you face in directing an epistolary play like Letters of Suresh, and what were the most rewarding aspects of the process? Well, every play comes with a unique set of challenges. Even though ‘Mughal-e-Azam :The Musical’ was a mammoth undertaking and ‘Letters of Suresh’ is much more intimate, it posed the kind of creative challenges I have never faced before. It took me back to minimalist story-telling which relies on the power of imagination and converses at a subliminal level with the audience. An epistolary format requires that the written word is authentically conveyed through gestures and verbal expressions and yet it has to be immersive enough to compensate for the lack of ornamentation. In the end, what the actors and I learnt is that good writing has great power and stripping away visual distractions in fact allowed the audience to engage intimately with the characters’ inner worlds. Witnessing the actors breathe life into these characters was immensely rewarding. With your history of successful productions like Mughal-e-Azam and Mahatma v/s Gandhi, how did your approach differ while directing Letters of Suresh? I have answered this already. Like I mentioned, every play comes with its own sets of challenges and so unlike ‘Mughal-e-Azam : The Musical’ and ‘Mahatma v/s Gandhi’, ‘Letters of Suresh’ marked a departure from an expansive scale. It had a confessional tenor, an intimate tone and an unobtrusive set design that emphasized the power of the written word and the actors’ performances. The goal of every production, every play however is the same; to offer the audiences a transformative emotional experience. Would you care to talk about how you picked the actors for their specific roles in the play, especially Vir Hirani who plays the titular character? Vir Hirani is a trained actor and an incredibly sensitive human-being. He was perfectly suited to play Suresh because he instinctively understood that this character had many hidden depths. He also had the requisite acting chops as he has trained at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). In a way, the story chose him to play Suresh. The same is true for all the actors. We instantly knew that they were perfect for their parts. They had the voice, the presence and the emotional depth to do justice to their characters. Excerpts from the chat with playwright Rajiv Joseph for the play ‘Letters of Suresh’. How did you and director Feroz Abbas Khan connect and how did the decision to stage ‘Letters of Suresh’ in India come about ? Feroz approached me in New York last year and we spoke of the possibility. It was a great honor that he felt so strongly about my play. Did you share a common vision for the production and were any specific elements included in the play just for the Indian audiences? I was so pleased that Feroz loved my play and I trusted his vision. He’s an important and rervered theater artist. It was easy to say to him—go forth and make the play! What was the core idea from which ‘Letters of Suresh’ grew and did any personal experiences influence its development? This play is a companion piece (not a sequel) to an earlier play of mine, called Animals Out of Paper. In that play, there is a scene that takes place in Nagasaki, Japan. As I began writing this play, I knew Nagasaki would play a part in it, and I traveled there. That journey was hugely important for the writing of the play. Meanwhile, ‘Letters of Suresh’ deftly explores themes of love, grief, and death as well as the pursuit of comfort and calm in the face of extreme existential loneliness. The story’s four pen pals have little in common other than their craving for interpersonal relationships."

(Image: Shutterstock) Journalism is the oldest profession practiced, and it is the most powerful tool for effecting significant social change. Every year on May 30, Hindi Journalism Day commemorates the founding of the country’s first Hindi newspaper. This day is significant for all the Hindi newspaper journalists in India. The newspaper played a vital role in creating awareness amongst the people and uniting them during India’s freedom struggle. The communication medium that was most popular at that time was the newspapers. The first Hindi-language newspaper, Udant Martand, was published in India on May 30, 1826, from Calcutta (now Kolkata). Pandit Jugal Kishore Shukla published the weekly newspaper on Tuesdays alone and priced at Rs 2 annually. At the time, he had no idea what would emerge of his initiative. During India’s freedom struggle, the publication was instrumental in raising public awareness. This newspaper was the most widely read media at the time. The publication date, May 30, 1826, is known as Hindi Journalism Day or Hindi Patrakarita Diwas. However, due to increased mailing costs and a remote readership, Udant Martand was unable to be published for an extended length of time due to financial difficulties. On May 30, 1826, Udant Martand, the first Hindi newspaper, was published. This day has since become recognised as a watershed moment in Hindi journalism history. Pandit Jugal Kishore Shukla was the newspaper’s first editor. He was originally from Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh and then moved to Calcutta, West Bengal. Pandit Jugal Kishore Shukla possessed extensive knowledge of Hindi, English, Sanskrit, and Persian languages. At the time, English, Persian and Bangla publications had a large readership, leaving no room for Hindi media. Udant Martand began with a weekly print run of 500 copies. This was the first newspaper totally published in Hindi using the Devanagari script. At the time, many newspapers in Bengali and Urdu were the most widely read, with a very small proportion of the Calcutta readership reading Hindi. Udant Martand employees spoke a combination of Khari Boli and Braj Bhasha Hindi dialects. Later, the newspaper failed owing to financial difficulties, but it sparked a new era of Hindi journalism in India."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Riya Ashok Madayi News18.com Last Updated: May 30, 2024, 11:47 IST Mumbai, India Discover the magic of Goa's monsoon celebrations, which combine celebration and tradition into a vibrant, exuberant spectacle. As the monsoon clouds gather over the lush landscapes of Goa, the air is filled with anticipation for the vibrant festivals that mark this season. From cultural celebrations to religious rituals, each festival in Goa during the monsoon holds its own unique charm, offering visitors and locals alike a glimpse into the rich ensemble of Goan traditions. In this article, we will delve into the upcoming festivals that define the monsoon season in this coastal paradise. One of the most popular monsoon festivals in Goa is the Sao Joao Festival, which is celebrated with great fervour across the state. Named after St. John the Baptist, this feast day is marked by water-centric festivities, where revellers jump into wells, rivers, and ponds. The Sao Joao Festival is celebrated annually in Goa on June 24th. Colourful water floats, traditional music, and locals and tourists alike wearing copels (floral wreaths) add to the festive atmosphere, making it a joyous occasion for all. Kicking off the monsoon festivities is the Sangodd Festival, a traditional boat festival celebrated by the fishing community in Goa. Annually, on June 29th, Goa commemorates the feast days of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Saint Peter, holds profound significance for the fishing community and this festival marks the commencement of the ‘rampon’ fishing season, prompting rituals of sea blessings and boat preparations for the impending endeavours. In observance of this festivity, canoes are ingeniously interconnected with wooden planks, setting a transient stage atop the water. The day’s festivities unfold upon this platform, adorned with embellished boats bedecked with coconut palms, blooms, and colourful balloons. Additional boat structures reminiscent of churches grace the water’s surface. Equipped with sound systems, fishermen in vibrant attire entertain the audience with folk dances, musical performances, skits, and cherished traditional melodies. A religious festival known as “The Mud Festival,” is a traditional celebration observed during the monsoon season in Goa, particularly in June. Originating from the village of Marcel in Ponda, this unique festival centres around the Devki Krishna Temple, dedicated to Lord Krishna and his mother Devki. While the precise origins of the festival remain unclear, the villagers commemorate it with great enthusiasm each year. Festivities include joyful revelry, where participants gleefully roll in the mud and engage in traditional games. The grounds adjacent to the Devki Krishna Temple transform into a bustling arena, welcoming attendees. At the core of this elaborate feast lies an intriguing custom where devotees offer cucumbers to St. Anne as a gesture of reverence. This unique tradition originates from the abundance of cucumbers during the season, symbolising gratitude in a fitting manner. Cucumbers also mark the first harvest of the season in Goa. According to the clergy, individuals bring two cucumbers, placing one at the feet of Our Lady while touching the other to the sacred statue. The cucumbers presented during the festivities are then shared among the local community, visiting priests, and nearby villages. Some prefer to savour the cucumbers fresh, while others incorporate them into revitalising salads. As the monsoon showers drench the landscape, the picturesque island of Divar comes alive with the vibrant Bonderam Festival. Held on the fourth Saturday of August, this festival is characterised by a colourful parade featuring mock battles between rival wards of the village. Each group displays elaborate floats adorned with flags, vying for the coveted trophy. The festivities are attended by tourists in large numbers; they culminate in a spirited celebration of Goan culture, complete with music, dance, and delicious food. As the monsoon descends upon Goa, it brings with it a whirlwind of festivities that capture the essence of Goan culture and tradition. From boat processions to culinary celebrations, each festival offers a unique glimpse into the rich heritage of this coastal paradise. So, pack your bags, don your festive attire, and immerse yourself in the magic of monsoon festivities in Goa."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Shreeja Bhattacharya News18.com Last Updated: June 02, 2024, 16:13 IST New Delhi, India The process of the book began sometime in 2018 after the author's first book had been published. (Images: Instagram) Manish Gaekwad’s ‘The Last Courtesan’ offers a poignant and vivid exploration into the life of a courtesan during the twilight of a fading era. Set against the backdrop of a rapidly modernizing India, the memoir delves into themes of tradition, transformation, and survival. Gaekwad’s narrative around his mother’s experience as a nautch girl weaves a tapestry of rich historical detail and compelling character study, presenting a world where art, desire, and societal change collide. Through the eyes of the protagonist, readers are invited into the intricacies of a life marked by both grandeur and marginalization. With delicate yet powerful prose, Gaekwad resurrects a lost world, inviting reflection on the complexities of heritage and the passage of time. In an exclusive conversation with News18, the author spoke about their mother’s life and legacy, how the memoir came into being, Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s ‘Heeramandi’ and much more. In the book, you explore your mother’s life and legacy. How did you approach the process of writing her memoir? The process was quite simple. My mother spoke, and I recorded and transcribed it. I was just the stenographer! During the pandemic, when she was severely ill, I was looking after her in Calcutta. We used the time to bond, and especially at tea time, the twilight hour when the horizon is between night and day and one finds it abetting reflection on one’s life and purpose. Did you always plan on writing about your mother? Could you recall incidents from your childhood that perhaps spiked an interest in you to get to know your mother a little better? No. It just happened. In 2018, after my first novel was out, I wrote an essay about us, which went viral and led to a book deal. That’s when I went to my mother and said,’See, there’s an auction amongst publishers for your story.’ She laughed and was game for it. She had been telling me incidents from her life throughout my childhood, but the time was ripe now. As a child, I was too busy reading Archie comics, Champak, Chandamama, Target magazine, Misha, Mayapuri, etc to take an interest in my mother’s story. In fact, I’d heard her recall incidents from her life like a comic-book adventure. She didn’t dwell on it miserably. Even when I was recording her, she was enjoying narrating it like a thrill ride. Your personal relationship with your mother has played a vital role in the creative process of this book. Would you mind elaborating on how it influenced your writing? My mother and I lived away from each other for long stretches. She put me in boarding school when I was five. She sent me to live with her sister in a slum in Poona when I was seventeen. I then worked in several cities, meeting her once a year. So I think the detachment helped in being objective and not allowing my emotions to colour my writing about her. I think of her as a persona outside her identity as my mother. She’s so much more than that and all of it has to be expressed without whitewashing her story as her only child. You discuss the concept of identity in the book. How do you think your mother’s experiences shaped her sense of self and how has that impacted your life and the way you grew up? She saw too much too soon. It hardened her spine but also softened her gaze. Her instinct was strong and her actions were kind and helpful. I believe it passes from mother to child. I try to live by her values, which is to survive the odds with a tear in one eye and a smile in the other. In what ways do you think writing “The Last Courtesan” has changed your perception of your mother and her life? How can one not love a woman like that? She endears herself in death which she perhaps found sentimental in life. In writing TLC, I realised how she moved heaven and earth to provide me with the life that was denied to her. When she passed on, a friend wrote to me: ‘All moms are great but yours was greater than most.’ It floods my heart. Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Heeramandi has sparked a renewed interest in the lives of courtesans. What are your thoughts on his approach and depiction? It’s all fantasy. Reality doesn’t always promise entertainment. I quite enjoy a spectacle. Coming back to your book, would you like to see ‘The Last Courtesan’ being turned into a film? If yes, how would you want it to be made and who would you prefer to see as the lead? Sure, why not? If the biopic isn’t only about heroics but a more rounded personality. It’s entirely up to the filmmaker’s vision how they make it. I haven’t thought of the lead, maybe it merits a debutant or someone I can’t think of other than the obvious big-ticket names, who should get a chance. Lastly, if you could please tell us what is next for you in line? I am writing the follow-up to TLC, about my own growing up years as a child in the kothas of Calcutta and Bombay."

Bakrid, also known as Eid al-Adha, is a major Islamic holiday celebrated worldwide. It marks the culmination of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Bakrid is observed on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the twelfth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. The date varies each year based on the moon sighting. Bakrid commemorates Prophet Ibrahim’s (Abraham) willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael as an act of obedience to God (Allah). In a display of mercy, Allah intervened and replaced Ishmael with a ram for the sacrifice."

(Image: Shutterstock) Muslims commemorate Eid-ul-Adha, also known as the Feast of Sacrifice, for three days each year. It begins on the tenth day of the Islamic calendar’s last month, Dhu al-Hijjah. Given that Muslims follow the lunar calendar, it might happen at any time of year. ALSO READ: Bakrid Mubarak 2024: Wishes, Images, Quotes and More for Eid al-Adha This year, Eid-ul-Adha is being celebrated today on June 17. The celebration honours Prophet Ibrahim, also referred to as Abraham in Christianity and Judaism, for his willingness to offer his son Ismail (Isaac) as a sacrifice on Allah’s command. According to the Quran, Ibrahim had a dream in which Allah ordered to sacrifice his son Ismail as a token of his submission to God. In the story, Shaytaan (Satan), tries to trick Ibrahim and entice him not to carry out the deed, but Ibrahim squelches him. But as soon as Ibrahim was all set to sacrifice Ismail, Allah intervened and summoned Angel Jibreel (Gabriel) along with a ram to serve in its place. For Muslims, Eid-al-Adha is a particularly special day. Muslims believe that the command was a test from Allah, as the festival honours the prophet Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice his son when Allah told him to. It is also significant given that it serves as a reminder to Muslims worldwide to rely on Allah in all matters and occurrences. It is observed on the tenth day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the lunar month associated with the Hajj (pilgrimage). The Makkah pilgrimage is one of Islam’s five pillars. Muslims prepare for celebrations by completing Wudhu and Fajr prayers, as well as paying special attention to their appearance. Eid prayers are traditionally offered at large gatherings. After the prayer, there is a discourse, called a Khutba, that lasts for fifteen to twenty minutes. After the sermon and prayers for Eid, the Qurbani sacrifice may start. The flesh of the slaughtered animal is divided into three portions: one for the individual performing the sacrifice, one for friends and family and one for the underprivileged and needy. Muslims then gather to commemorate the feast of the sacrifice, during which gifts and greetings are exchanged."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Shreeja Bhattacharya News18.com Last Updated: June 17, 2024, 13:50 IST New Delhi, India Chetan Bhagat now has expanded his literary prowess to the realm of audio dramas. (Image: X) Chetan Bhagat over the years has carved a niche for himself in the realm of contemporary literature. Renowned for his engaging and relatable storytelling, Bhagat has become a household name in India and beyond. With a knack for blending humour, drama, and social commentary, Bhagat’s works have not only dominated bestseller lists but have also inspired numerous Bollywood adaptations, further cementing his influence in popular culture. In a groundbreaking venture, the writer has expanded his literary prowess to the realm of audio dramas. His latest offering, available on Audible, promises to captivate listeners with his signature narrative style, rich character development, and compelling plot twists. During an exclusive interview with News18, the author spoke not just about his newest work but also shed some light on all that he is, all that he believes in and all that is to come forth and more. You have a new audio drama that has just been released, ‘The Girl In Room 105’. Could you talk a little about that and how you came up with it? So, you know, there are audiobooks and a lot of people know what they are now, But there is a new category now, which is audio dramas, which is basically like watching an audio movie, you can say, because there are actors, there is dialogue, there’s music, there is, you know, tension, all those things like it’s been produced like a movie apart from the, of course, cameras and all, but there’s a casting done with actors, boys voice, girls voice. So it’s like an audio drama now. It was Audible’s idea, they have done this very successfully in the West, I think, and they want to do it in India. And I always like new things, I always like to adapt innovative things, new, new ways to tell my story, whether long ago, it was turning books into movies. But now we live in a mobile revolution, where everybody has a phone. And everybody wants content in their own hands. And I feel this is a great format, because you don’t have to keep watching the screen, you can do your thing, you can do at least simple tasks, like cooking, or folding your clothes, or going to the gym, going to a walk, and cleaning your closet, and keep listening to this. So it’s an excellent way to be productive and yet enjoy good entertainment, content, etc. So I loved it. How different is it, you know, being a part of producing an audiobook or a podcast or an audio drama for this instance, as opposed to writing a novel, can you talk to us about the process? The only thing is, camera is not there, make up is not there, art direction is not there. But I am there, dubbing is there, editing is there, casting is there, scripting is there, you know, production is there, scheduling is there, marketing is there, launch is there, everything is there, only the visual aspect is not there. And yeah, so it’s very interesting. Not just about this particular subject, but what is it that truly inspires you? And how do you decide upon a subject? Because your works have been explored so well through movies. And now, of course, through audio. I think I’m quite a naturally curious person. And the thing I’m most curious about is people. I’m very curious about people. I feel like whenever I see a person, I feel like they must have a story behind them. How did they grow up and how, you know, what makes them happy, what makes them sad? I’m always very curious about people. And I think India is a fascinating country where there are so many different stories out there. So that’s what inspires me. And when I observe the world around me, I travel around a lot because I’m a motivational speaker. So I must be visiting at least 50 cities a year in India. I get a very good sense of what people in India are all about. What are they thinking? What are their conflicts? And naturally, a story like then comes to me. It’s quite a, I would say, magical process, you can call it, or it’s just a process which happens at the subconscious level. And then I write it. And then usually that story connects and people like it. And once people like it in one format, like a book, it usually the story will travel in other formats as well. So that’s been my journey so far. It’s been 20 years. In fact, 14th May is when, 2004 is when Five Point Someone my first book came out. So we are at a 20 year anniversary. It’s been a long journey, actually. If I just think about it, it feels like it was just now. And you just mentioned that it’s at a subconscious level that a story comes to you. But it’s also very difficult to put words to your thoughts. How do you manage? Yeah, but that is the gift. Everybody feels things, you know. From what I’ve seen, every human being feels things. Very few people can firstly turn those feelings into thoughts. They just feel something. They just feel uncomfortable, happy, sad, whatever. But some people can’t even tell what it is. Some people can at least express it in their own head, in their thoughts. Some people can express it in words. And we call those people very expressive, words wise. And some people can’t. Then some people can even express it in writing form. Like even when I use a pen or a keyboard, it flows out exactly the way it is in my mind. And I think a lot of people cannot do it. So I’ve come to realize that everybody feels, but the expression of those feelings varies among people. So that’s a very interesting way. I think if you stay a writer long enough, you become very curious about the process. How do stories come? How am I able to do it? And some other people are not able to do it. And I think that’s just the way it is. Maybe some wiring of my brain allows that to happen. Or maybe I don’t have a filter. All of us have a filter. We are scared to express ourselves. In a previous interview, you mentioned that there are three sides to you. One being Chetan, the entertainer. Could you talk to us more about that side? How is it different? And do you think he’s much less explored than Chetan, the writer? You know, I’ve been lucky, you can say, that I also talk about national issues. On one hand, I’m writing love stories, modern histories, which are very popular, commercial, best-selling kind of fiction. But at the same time, I also write editorials. So I think that’s a different role sometimes. People expect me to be some kind of a role model and things like that. But when I write a love story or a modern history, that’s very weird to be a role model. If I show my hero becoming an alcoholic because he’s so in love, some people may say, what are you promoting? So I think that’s always a tough balance. There’s the entertainer in me. There is somebody who talks about national issues, or you can call it somebody who is an analyst. And then the third is there is an entrepreneur in me who wants to do business and also make money. So it’s always a balance of the three. Not everything I do can be about money, but not everything I do can be just for my expression. I have two kids going through college. I have to earn on that. So yeah, it’s a balance. And that’s the balance I was talking about. How do you hold on to that balance? It is not easy to balance out your sides, the two sides of yourself, especially. Yeah, and I think we all have that. I think we all have a side which is practical. And we all have a side which is just based on our emotions. And what we really want to do. Even in my motivational talks, I sometimes ask people, what is the job you would do even if you didn’t get paid for it? What is the job you’ll do for free? And that I think is often your passion. But at the same time, we have to pay the bills. We have to be practical in life. So I think we all struggle with that balance. And for me, I think I’ve been very fortunate. And I’m older now. I just turned 50 a few weeks back. So I think I’m becoming more and more about what I truly want to do. And it’s not about the money anymore for me. Because largely, my kids are grown up. Okay, they have a little bit of college left. But other than that, I see no reason why I should go on chasing money now. And I think that will bring out my best work also. Because ironically, the best work comes, the most successful work also comes when you write it with the intention of no outcome. I’ve often found that. Like whether was my first book, I had no idea that it’ll become so big. So whenever we do something with a pure intention, which is, I just want to express myself, or I just feel this is important to share with the world. I found that those, that becomes the most successful work of mine. And whenever I try to be the entrepreneur and say this will work and this will sell, it often doesn’t work as well. Two decades down the line, you still think that your ‘best work’ is due and you are yet to put it out in the world? That is a good question. And I think we should all think that. I think while it’s easy to rest on your past laurels and say, okay, you know, I did Five Point Someone, I did Two States and Three Idiots and all this stuff. And that’s how people often introduce me also. But in my head, it’s gone. It’s history. And for me, I will stop growing. If I think that my best has already done, I think my best work is yet to come. And I have reason for that. Like I said, the financial pressure is not there now. And I’m free to write. And I’ve established myself. I’ve proved myself. I think when I was young, I used to get very touchy about critics or someone saying, you know, some people don’t like your work or that this person trolled you. All these things, I’m well past all that now. I am not 35. I’m 50. So yeah, I think there is no reason why I cannot write with more freedom than ever before. But as a writer and a public figure, it’s not always compliments that come your way, right? So how do you deal with the darker side of fame? Now I have the papaya philosophy. It’s not like a universally liked food. Some people don’t like it so much. Like mangoes, everybody likes. Bananas, everybody likes. But papaya is an acquired taste. Some people like papaya and some people hate it. Now, is it the papaya’s fault? It’s not the papaya’s fault. So I think I know who I am. I know I have some pluses. I have certain appeal to some people. And to some people, I’m just a papaya they don’t like. So it’s not the papaya’s fault. And the papaya should not try to be a mango or a banana. That will become really weird, you know? So I just like, I think you reach a point, being old may have some disadvantages, but it has some advantages. Is that you reach a level of comfort with who you are. And you know, okay, maybe I’m not good enough for some people. Or maybe I just don’t work for some people. And that’s how God made me. That’s how I’m a papaya."

Guru Hargobind is recognised as the driving force behind the Sikh community’s militarisation. With the community at receiving end of persecution by the Mughal rulers, he underlined the need for the populace to cultivate a martial mentality. Guru Hargobind Sahib was always seen with two swords, reflecting the “Miri-Piri” ideology. The first sword, Miri, signified power, whereas Piri represented his spiritual abilities."

(Image: Shutterstock) Kabir Jayanti is celebrated to commemorate Kabir, a revered poet and saint. It is believed that the mystic saint was born in 1398 A.D in present-day Varanasi. His birth anniversary is celebrated every year on the full moon day in the month of Jyeshtha, which falls in May or June in the Gregorian calendar. This year Kabir Jayanti falls on June 22. Kabir Das is known for his simple but profound poetry. He promoted self-reflection and social harmony. Today Kabir’s couplets are a part of the government-run school curriculum. Kabir’s poems were in Sadhukkadi, a dialect which borrows from Braj Bhasha, Awadhi, and Bhojpuri. With time the poems and couplets were translated into other languages. Kabir’s legacy is carried by Kabir Panth, a religious community based on Kabir’s philosophy of ritual-free devotion, nonviolence, aparigraha (being non-materialistic), and Satya (eternal truth)."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Riya Ashok Madayi News18.com Last Updated: June 22, 2024, 14:50 IST Mumbai, India Burrah, a Punjabi artist, considers his path in music, the value of authenticity, and his goals of being well-known worldwide. (Image: Instagram) Jasdeep Singh, famously known as Burrah, shares his inspiring journey, from regional singing competitions to being featured on MTV Hustle Season 3 and Spotify’s RADAR programme. He discusses how his diverse musical influences, including hip-hop, Punjabi pop, and global icons, have shaped his unique sound. Burrah also reflects on the evolving landscape of Punjabi music and his dreams of taking it to the global stage in this exclusive chat with News18.com. A post shared by Burrah (@burrahmusic) Excerpts from the interview: Could you describe how you went from competing in regional singing competitions to being on MTV Hustle Season 3 and finally joining Spotify’s RADAR programme? What impact has this trip had on your musical career? In the last interview, I mentioned whether language is a barrier. I talked about how, when you’re on a show like MTV Hustle, there is a certain perception the audience has. There’s a slight mismatch in perception, but it’s a beautiful aspect of the hustle. I felt there was more depth in storytelling, and people saw me primarily in the hip-hop mould. As I progressed beyond Hustle, I realised that while I enjoy listening to hip-hop, I grew up with a mix of pop, soul, and hip-hop. My dad introduced me to ABBA and the Bee Gees, and I listened to a lot of Gurbani. I was also a huge fan of Punjabi pop artists like Babbu Maan and Daler Mehndi. I realised my musical spectrum is much broader than what was shown in the competition. This understanding deepened as I worked on my new album and released new songs outside of the show. When my first song gained coverage, I felt more satisfied, as it reflected a more authentic version of myself. I have gained more clarity in my artistic journey and evolution. People will learn more about me as I continue to evolve. Now, I am happy and satisfied with my style, striking a more authentic chord with myself. How do you strike a balance between attempting to appeal to a larger, maybe global audience and preserving your distinct Punjabi musical identity? I am a fan of Michael Jackson and listen to his music, especially his Earth song, every day. Some sounds have a deep-rooted, universal appeal, and beyond that, there is energy. When an artist stands with a mic or creates a song, their eyes and the audience intuitively understand all the rules. I truly believe that if music comes from the heart and soul, is well-intended, and comes from a place of love, it resonates with others. For me, being genuine is more important than fitting into a specific mould. That’s what I’m currently focusing on. As I move forward, I will retain the essence of Punjabi sounds but experiment with them so much that people will recognise and say, “This is a Punjabi song.” Punjabi musicians have had a big impact on the world music landscape. What does it feel like to be a part of a musical legacy that includes some of the world’s most popular exports from India? Honestly, I am grateful to be able to do this. It’s a dream come true to make Punjabi music and be considered part of this lineage. I come from a very small home, and as a child, I used to ride a scooter with my whole family. Growing up, I listened to Dilir Manbeeb and Gurudas Maan Sahab. Seeing Gurudas Maan Sahab pass the baton to Diljit Bhai, and watching Diljit Sir grow into what he is today, has been inspiring. Listening to Sukhbir in recent years has also been influential. I have had these idols in my heart, but I also have international idols, like Kendrick Lamar, Dave Chappelle. Though he is not from a musical background, he represents cultural impact. I often think about how, musically, I am rooted in my Punjabi heritage. I wonder how Punjabi music and arts can evolve, become more diverse, and reach a universal audience. So, I am both grateful and optimistic. I am in a phase of absorption and experimentation, trying to establish this vision. A post shared by Burrah (@burrahmusic) What are your expectations for Punjabi music’s future on the international scene, given that platforms like Spotify are making it simpler for local artists to get noticed by audiences throughout the world? Let me share a very personal dream with you. Artists often get vivid visuals, and I had one where I saw myself wearing my school uniform at the Grammy Awards. I stood there, in my school uniform as a costume, and won my first Grammy for Best Record of the Year. I was elated. In my post-award speech, I would acknowledge those who have been part of my journey and emphasise that Punjabis are not a stereotype; we represent an international culture. This is my dream, and I have visualised it clearly. Punjabi music is more than just a way to promote or cope with material things. It encompasses folklore and stories that we can blend to create a legacy. From Guru Nanak Dev Ji to the present, we are a warrior race committed to truth, and this legacy should be reflected in our art. My goal is to invite this truth into our art and showcase our culture to the world. I have big dreams. I aim to make a mark at the Grammys and create movies that compete for Oscars. My heart is set on working for Punjabi arts, to do so much that we can all reach these heights. Every day is an affirmation for me, inspired by Diljit Paaji. Diljit is opening doors, and by next year, he will be Grammy-nominated. This progress makes me happy and motivates me to work harder. Imagine a stadium with over a million people, including 120 Punjabi artists. If I am there, it will be incredible. I truly wish to get there one day. It’s all a matter of time, and I believe it will happen. What guidance would you provide aspiring Punjabi musicians hoping to establish themselves in the music business? How can they take advantage of programmes such as RADAR? When a person passionately creates something for themselves, gets excited, and uploads it, platforms like Spotify and their partners often notice and amplify these voices. The key is to just go for it and show the side of yourself that you are most afraid to reveal. Personally, I was hesitant to share my passionate, emotional, or spiritual side. But now, thanks to RADAR and this opportunity, I can talk about and amplify this part of myself. You need to show the side of you that you fear the most, even if it has been rejected before, because that is your true goal. That’s what I believe should happen. Meanwhile, RADAR, Spotify’s global emerging artist programme, has completed three years in India and has entered into its successful fourth year this year. RADAR has been spotlighting rising talent in music across 25+ regions where Spotify is available and hence, this year Spotify is bringing on popular artists such as OAFF and Savera, Hansika Pareek, Swastik The Band, RANJ x Clifr, Boys from Mars, Samad Khan, Burrah and more. We wish to highlight RADAR’s contribution in providing a platform for these budding artists to create their own fan base and online community across the globe. Spotify is also responsible for deepening the connection between local artists and listeners. “Punjabi music listeners are among those who spend the most amount of time on Spotify in India, and we have seen tremendous growth in the consumption of this language, year-on-year. With dedicated emerging artist programmes for Punjabi artists, including RADAR and Fresh Finds, our intent is to provide these artists with a platform, help them grow, and put a spotlight on Punjabi music,” says Dhruvank Vaidya, Head of Music and Podcast, Spotify India. “We’re also celebrating four years of RADAR in India this year, and hope to enable more artists to find their audience and showcase their talent through this programme,” he he added."

The “perfect” age to marry is a topic of debate in the modern world. While societal pressures and family expectations can influence decisions, it is crucial to remember that the timeline for marriage should be determined by the individual, not by societal norms or expectations. According to Anuradha Gupta, Founder & CEO, Vows For Eternity, the timeline for marriage should be a personal decision, free from societal pressures. In today’s world, modern relationships have challenged traditional gender roles, with both men and women striving to achieve career goals and follow passions before considering marriage. Gupta emphasizes that a marriage must be built on a solid foundation of love, shared vision, aligned values, and compatible lifestyles. Dating in the modern era can be challenging, especially for busy professionals. Gupta suggests that to find a compatible partner, one should consider joining a contemporary matchmaking network, singles-only club, or a personalized dating service. Reputable matchmaking services can help individuals navigate the complexities of modern relationships and find the fulfilling partnership they seek. Hitesh Chakraworty, Relationship Expert & Coach, Spiritual Healer, and Author, Decoding the Mystery Behind 3, 6 and 9, offers a historical perspective on the ideal age for marriage. He notes, “The ideal age for marriage has long been debated, influenced by culture and socioeconomics. Historically, people married young, often for economic and family reasons, but today, the trend has reversed.” Chakraworty points out that the decision regarding the “perfect” age for marriage is subjective and varies according to individual circumstances and cultural context. Individuals should make decisions based on their own readiness rather than on external expectations. Chakraworty believes that marriage should occur when both partners feel poised and aligned in their life goals, ensuring a foundation of understanding and commitment. The debate over the perfect age to marry underscores the importance of personal choice and readiness. In an era where traditional gender roles are being redefined and individuals are prioritizing personal growth and career goals, the decision to marry should be based on mutual readiness and shared life goals. Whether through modern matchmaking services or personal networks, finding a partner who aligns with your values and vision is key to a successful and fulfilling marriage."

(Image: Shutterstock) For many, the term ‘Sleep Divorce’ might suggest relationship issues, but that’s not the case. ‘Sleep Divorce’ simply means that partners choose to sleep in separate rooms instead of sharing a bed. This practice is often adopted when couples experience decreased sleeping compatibility. Various factors can contribute to this decision, such as excessive snoring, restlessness or differing sleep schedules. We all know how frustrating it can be to miss out on a good night’s sleep. Even the smallest annoyance can set you off. This lack of sleep can strain your relationship, leading to what’s known as a ‘sleep divorce.’ According to a study by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), more than one-third of people say they occasionally or consistently sleep in different bedrooms. “We know that poor sleep can worsen your mood, and those who are sleep-deprived are more likely to argue with their partners. There may be some resentment toward the person causing the sleep disruption which can negatively impact relationships,” Dr Seema Khosla, pulmonologist and spokesperson for the AASM said. Meanwhile, other experts believe that in order to receive the benefits of this practice, one must approach it with no preconceptions and an open mind.

For a long time now, dieting has been accepted as the most common way of losing weight. The years of diet culture conditioning have led to the belief that being thin is healthy. As a result, it has become acceptable to go on nutrition-depriving diets in a bid to lose weight. It is not uncommon to see people give up carbohydrates or sugar entirely to reach their dieting goals. Restrictive diets may make people shed weight quickly, but they also come with both physical and psychological side effects. In recent years, many dieticians and nutritionists have tried to raise awareness about unhealthy dieting practices. Health experts argue that one should focus on a combination of exercise and eating a balanced diet to reach their fitness goals. Occasionally, treating yourself to your favourite calorie-rich food is also encouraged. Earlier this week, renowned nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar shared a video where she called out diet routines where people completely get off sugar or obsessively count their calories. She called this mindset unhealthy. In a witty speech, Diwekar explained, First of all, we must know that eating correctly isn’t about depriving ourselves of food that we like. Dieting’s definition has unfortunately become associated with suffering and sacrifice. Dieting is not marriage, so why should it be full of suffering and sacrifice?” A post shared by Rujuta Diwekar (@rujuta.diwekar) She then connected dating and dieting and said, My dating advice, which no one asks for but I always give, is to never marry a girl or a boy who is on a diet, who is off sugar, or who doesn’t eat. This is because you don’t want that kind of negativity in your life. You are looking for a person who eats well and also feeds their loved ones well. This way, you can share all of the ups and downs of your life. It can’t happen with people; you can’t even share a meal without them complaining about the calorie count or the protein levels. You must unfriend people who are like that.” Her video has gotten over 10,000 likes since it was posted on June 1. In the comments, many people lauded her for using her platform to promote healthy eating in a light-hearted but effective manner. Rujuta Diwekar has over 1.5 million Instagram followers. She routinely makes short video content about healthy eating."

Both spouses are only starting to know each other and seem to have few complaints about their significant other. Everything that new companion does – from their eating habits to the stories they tell – is amusing and delightful. Couples may experience difficulties when their honeymoon period has ended. They may disagree on major and minor issues, or they may question whether they want to continue courting their spouse after their flaws have been exposed. Furthermore, tasks that were formerly enjoyable, such as grocery shopping or cooking, may become mundane rather than exciting. As the early excitement fades, your relationship may become more subject to stress, boredom, and other responsibilities. To improve the quality of your bond, you must put forth effort and intentionality. This Miami-based therapist, Maria G. Sosa has shared some tips on how to keep the romance alive. “While we may never be able to get back to the honeymoon phase, we can continue tapping into all the behaviours that make this phase so exhilarating.

A friend, family member or a loved one coming out to you is a delicate, sensitive moment, which can evoke a wide range of emotions. It is important to process these feelings mindfully, to ensure you provide the support and acceptance the person coming out to you needs. Dr Mona Gujral, Delhi-based counselling psychologist, who shares her expertise on coto, a women-only social community app, says, “Firstly, acknowledge your own emotions. Whether you feel surprised, confused, or even unsure about what to say, understand that your emotions are natural. However, your focus should be on the person coming out to you. Listen attentively, be compassionate towards them and their emotions, offer your unconditional support, and most of all, do not be judgemental. Your reaction can significantly impact their sense of safety and acceptance, so it’s important to create a positive, respectful and comfortable environment in that moment and beyond.” Secondly, stay present and be empathetic. “Avoid rushing to label or judge both emotions and theirs. Instead, establish support by asking how you can best support them. Remember, you aren’t trying to solve their issues or fix anything, you are just supporting them, providing validation and being understanding,” adds Dr Gujral. If needed, turn to online platforms like coto or even therapists to help deal with the situation yourself, and to find the right guidance to help the person coming out to you. “Live consultations and online support groups are a great way to navigate these complex emotions. Through discussions, you can gain insights and strategies to manage your feelings effectively and help react to this situation (and many others) with compassion, ensuring your loved one feels safe, understood, and most importantly, loved for who they are,” signs off Dr Gujral."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Lifestyle Desk News18.com Last Updated: June 11, 2024, 18:53 IST New Delhi, India This year, Father's Day will be celebrated on June 16. (Image: Shutterstock) The relationship between a father and daughter is foundational, shaping the daughter’s self-esteem, confidence, and worldview. Experts from various fields emphasize the dynamics and importance of this bond, offering insights on how fathers can foster strong, positive connections with their daughters. Ontologist and mental health expert Aashmeen Munjaal highlights the critical role of fathers in their daughters’ lives. “A father’s role in sharing quality time with his daughter is very crucial. Fathers should participate in activities that align with the tastes of their daughters. This often leads to building a strong bond and trust between them,” she states. Munjaal further emphasizes that emotional support and proper guidance from fathers can help daughters excel in life. Fathers, with their focused approach and stress management skills, can significantly boost their daughters’ confidence through heartfelt, non-judgmental communication. Munjaal concludes, “Fathers are the primary source of motivation and inspiration for their daughters,” shaping their perceptions of men and providing a secure environment. Bharatnatyam dancer Apeksha Niranjan underscores the value of honest conversations to build trust and support. “Having honest conversations to build trust and make your daughter feel supported and understood,” she advises. Spending quality time together, engaging in shared activities, and having meaningful chats can immensely strengthen the father-daughter bond. Offering emotional support and listening without judgment are crucial for boosting her confidence and well-being. Fathers, through role modeling, demonstrate respectful behavior and positive values, helping daughters develop a strong sense of self and healthy future relationships. Encouraging their daughters’ dreams and ambitions further empowers them to pursue their goals and build resilience. Interior designer Punam Kalra eloquently describes the father’s role as a standard-bearer for his daughter. “There is no place higher than a daddy’s shoulder,” she says. Kalra believes that fathers set the benchmark against which daughters judge all other men in their lives. “One of the greatest gifts a father can give his daughter is the gift of believing in her,” she adds. This belief encourages daughters to seek the best version of themselves, resilient to bias and stigma. With their father’s support, daughters feel empowered to achieve their dreams. Kalra highlights that a father’s life becomes simpler yet intriguing, quieter yet noisier, and all the more merrier with a daughter, with the bond making the world seem small yet boundless with possibilities. Fashion designer Shilpi Gupta shares that fathers and daughters who engage in activities based on shared interests and hobbies tend to develop a strong sense of belonging. “It fosters a deep understanding and connection, creating lasting meaningful memories,” she explains. Open and honest communication helps build resilience and strengthens emotional well-being. Fathers’ support helps daughters navigate challenges effectively. Gupta suggests reinforcing the unique bond through fun rituals and traditions like weekly outings, father-daughter dates, movie nights, or special breakfasts in bed. Kathak dancer Shinjini Kulkarni reflects on the unique blend of love, mentorship, and inspiration in the father-daughter relationship. She recounts her childhood filled with creativity, shaped by her painter father. “Our shared moments in his studio were filled with art and rhythm, blending our passions into a tapestry of mutual respect and admiration,” she says. Despite occasional creative differences, their bond is rooted in unconditional love, patience, and expression. Kulkarni attributes her understanding of sports, politics, and the strength of unconditional love to her father. Ruchita Bansal, founder and creative director of Izzhaar, emphasizes the significance of encouraging adventure and fostering self-esteem. “Fathers push their children beyond their comfort zones, instilling fearlessness and bolstering self-esteem through support, praise, and boundless love,” she explains. By encouraging daughters to embrace challenges, fathers empower them to navigate the world with confidence. Bansal highlights the unique role fathers play in empowering their daughters, promoting healthier self-acceptance and self-esteem, and laying the groundwork for success across various life spheres. The father-daughter relationship is a cornerstone of a daughter’s emotional and psychological development. Experts across fields agree on the importance of quality time, emotional support, honest communication, and encouragement. By actively participating in their daughters’ lives, fathers not only strengthen their bond but also equip their daughters with the confidence and resilience needed to navigate life successfully. Fathers hold the power to inspire and motivate, setting a standard of respect and love that shapes their daughters’ perceptions and relationships throughout their lives."

Those who are natural givers andwhohave grown up becoming the peacemakers of the house may even feel uncomfortable when they receive compliments or support. If you believe this, this completely resonates with you. Remember, you’re not alone in this. Many people struggle with receiving affection. Speaking about the same, Instagram user Stephanie Rigg said, “If you are someone who has traditionally adopted the role of giver, caretaker, and support person in your relationships, there’s a good chance that receiving is something you struggle with. While it’s easy to complain about always occupying this role and blame others for not mirroring our efforts, often there’s more to this dynamic than meets the eye.” Here are five signs that prove that you struggle with receiving affection: “If some or all of the points in this post resonate with you, I would encourage you to reflect onwhere they come from. For many of us, it’s a cocktail of feeling unworthy and undeserving,togetherwith a fear of rejection and being too much. These wounds drive us to believe that to be loveable, we must be low maintenance and that our value in relationships resides in our ability to make others’ lives easier,” Stephanie Rigg added."

Opening Moves is the dating app’s new feature added to their Make The First Move functionality that gives women the option to set a question that their matches can respond to, creating a new way to engage with connections while keeping women in control. In the app’s new film, Khushi and Vedang bond over the app’s new Opening Moves feature, with Khushi asking Vedang questions like “Most iconic first date idea?” and “What’s your guilty pleasure?” Their interactions unveil personal anecdotes, showcase their vibrant chemistry, and highlight the shift in the dating experience by offering more choice in how women can make the first move on Bumble. Speaking on this partnership, actor Khushi Kapoor shares, “Being a part of this collaboration is really exciting for me. It represents a crucial shift in contemporary dating dynamics, empowering women to take charge of their own romantic journeys. I’m honoured to work with Bumble on this campaign which contributes to the transformation of the dating landscape, which is something that’s really important to me and my generation.” Vedang Raina, actor added, “Making the first move is not always easy, and I love that Bumble has continuously chosen to stay true to their women-first philosophy by updating how women can continue to initiate conversations on their own terms with the introduction of Opening Moves! I’m thrilled to be a part of a campaign that’s spearheading a shift towards a more equitable dating atmosphere. I hope that by watching us try Opening Moves, women see that they can use it to prioritise their preferences and dating approaches.” The app’s campaign and this partnership come at a time when women’s experiences have evolved, especially regarding empowerment in online dating. Keeping true to the app’s mission, equality remains a priority in relationships with the overwhelming majority (92%) of women stating it is a top marker in romance. However, how women define equality has evolved with almost 9 in 10 (88%) single women surveyed on the app globally stating that today, equality is about personal choice and autonomy to decide what’s right for you. Commenting on the campaign launch, Lucille McCart, APAC Communications Director, Bumble said, “We know that it’s important for women to have control over their experience, but we’ve also heard that some women feel like they are doing all of the work. In response to this, we’re introducing a choice in how you connect on Bumble. Now, more than ever, we need to advocate for women, so we’re considering this reset to be Bumble’s vow renewal – to build the next chapter of dating that continues to put women at the forefront.” “As we introduce these updates, our core principle of empowering women in every connection and relationship remains unchanged. We’re excited to collaborate with Vedang and Khushi for our India campaign on Opening Moves, which underscores Bumble’s continued commitment to making dating better for women by putting their experiences first,” she adds. Women can use one of Bumble’s recommended Opening Moves, or craft their own. According to Bumble’s research, nearly half of women (46%) surveyed on Bumble shared that having more ways to start a conversation would make their dating app experience even better. Whether using Bumble’s suggested Opening Moves or crafting their own, women now have robust tools at their disposal to forge meaningful connections on the platform. We get them to talk about the experience: What excites both of you most about partnering with Bumble for their India campaign, especially with the focus on ‘Opening Moves’? This partnership is truly exciting because Bumble has opened up so many doors when it comes to dating by making the process much easier and less intimidating, especially for women.

For example, I might say, “Hey, I have a fun idea to kick off our date! Let’s break the ice with a spontaneous question: What’s the most spontaneous thing you’ve ever done? It could be anything from a last-minute trip to an impromptu adventure. I love hearing about those exciting moments that make life memorable!” I would definitely ask them each to make their own opening moves based off of their own personal preferences and experiences just so that it’ll be a bit more personal to them individually.

It doesn’t matter if you’ve been with someone for a few weeks, months, or years, one thing is certain: It ain’t easy.

When really, grief, doubt, confusion, and loneliness are all part of the challenge of navigating a breakup.” A post shared by Stephanie Rigg (@stephanie__rigg) So, if you are also going through a breakup, read below the 8 things that are completely normal after the heartbreaking situation: But at the same time, the sooner you get normal, the better it is for you.

Let’s take a deeper look at what this trend is and how you can follow it. What is the three-month rule? The three-month rule can be considered as a probationary period for dating.

Dating app QuackQuack’s, latest study on GenZ dating patterns and tendencies shows that this new generation of daters are rebranding dating with innovative trends. The app’s online poll in the last week of May 2024 was attended by more than 11,000 daters between the ages of 18 and 26. The majority of the participants were students, IT professionals, and engineers, along with a mix of healthcare and finance professionals, content creators, teachers, and sales and marketing experts. The app’s Founder and CEO, Ravi Mittal, commented, “GenZ has been making waves in the dating world for quite some time now. We have a large portion of GenZ users and almost regularly we observe them dating quite differently from their predecessors. For instance, GenZ is not afraid to pick themselves, they are more thorough and slow, and they are very much focused on mental health; they would drop a relationship any day if that happens to affect their mental health. These trends might look drastic but they are equally important for a healthy dating life.”"

    "article_content": "Reported By : Swati Chaturvedi News18.com Last Updated: June 18, 2024, 22:41 IST New Delhi, India A common psychological manipulation technique that makes victims doubt reality, sanity, and self-worth is gaslighting. Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation where the abuser makes the victim question their own reality, memory, or perceptions. This tactic is used to gain control and create dependency, leaving the victim feeling confused, anxious, and self-doubting. “It is a form of psychological manipulation, emotional abuse, and control tactic often employed by narcissistic personalities. Victims of gaslighting feel helpless, powerless, depressed, anxious, and confused, constantly questioning themselves and their own reality. This emotional turmoil can lead to dependency on the gaslighter, seeking negative validation, and internalizing the abuser’s views, living in perpetual fear. Establishing healthy boundaries is crucial for victims to protect their mental and emotional well-being,” says Sohini Rohra, Counselling Psychologist & Mental Health Advocate. Gaslighting is an insidious form of emotional manipulation that can wreak havoc on one’s mental and emotional well-being. Anuradha Gupta, Founder & CEO of Vows For Eternity, opines, “Many individuals share heartbreaking stories of enduring its devastating effects. One client bravely recounted her experience with an ex-partner who consistently distorted facts, twisted events, and denied occurrences she vividly remembered. This constant erosion of her reality left her feeling bewildered, anxious, and deeply uncertain about her perception of truth.” Individuals subjected to gaslighting often experience heightened anxiety, confusion, and a loss of trust in themselves. Over time, this can lead to a decline in self-esteem and a distorted self-perception. For those affected, seeking support and recognizing the signs early are crucial steps toward reclaiming their mental and emotional well-being. Why Do People Resort to Gaslighting? Gupta adds, “People resort to gaslighting for various reasons, often rooted in insecurities and a desire for control. Some use it to maintain dominance in a relationship, creating dependency and ensuring their power. Others employ gaslighting to avoid responsibility or deflect blame.” Narcissistic individuals, in particular, use it to preserve their inflated self-image by belittling others. Ultimately, gaslighting is a manipulative tactic to assert control, distort reality, and protect fragile egos. Gaslighters rely on lies and deception to erode your sense of self. It’s normal to doubt your version of reality when the manipulation comes from someone close to you, leading to confusion and negative self-talk. It’s never too late to take control of what type of people and thoughts occupy your personal and mental space. By trusting yourself, setting up a support system, and establishing firm boundaries, you can protect your mental health and sense of self—whether or not the gaslighter remains in your life."

Various celebrities embraced the trend with a twist of their own and had our attention. However, it is Wamiqa Gabbi who nailed the trend with her recent photoshoot. Proving her knack for fashion sense, the actress simply just took our hearts away with her sartorial power and we are not even complaining. For the latest digital edition of Grazia magazine, Wamiqa dressed in an all-denim outfit, making even the humble basics appear a noteworthy look. her outfit comprised an embroidered dark indigo denim jacket and bell-bottom jeans, both from Levi’s. Further, the expertise of fashion director Pasham Alwani who came on board to style the actress combined with the Jubilee actor’s attention to detail resulted in a mic-drop moment. Adding a fair share of bling to her outfit, she wore silver-toned cylinder-shaped hoops to accessorise her look. Do not miss her matching sterling silver earcuffs adorning her ears while also enhancing the appeal of her overall look. And of course, her black crossover strappy platform heels which she grabbed from the shelves of International brand Charles & Keith to complete the outfit. Now that we are done decoding her outfit, let’s zoom into the know detailing of her hair and makeup, which truly stood out, thanks to her makeup artist Anukul Dhara. While the perfect dash of teal blue eyeshadow on her eyelids added a colourpop to her otherwise basic ensemble, her feathery brows, generously bronzed and highlighted face, and a glossy nude lip colour accentuated her sharp features. The Khufiya actor’s hair styling was also on point. The messy waves held back together into an effortless braid finished off her look. However, the stylist ensured to frame her face well by leaving some of her tresses loose. Wamiqa Gabbi is proud of what she has achieved so far. While speaking to Grazia, she said, “I grew up with Bollywood and to have had the chance to enter the industry when it has gotten so democratised is truly luck. Everyone knows now that if you want to make it here, it’s ultimately what you have that will get you so far. I am just happy that I get to live my dream every day.”"

With her outfit so gorgeous, the actress did not need any heavy necklace to amp up her look. In terms of makeup, Neeru showcased her love for minimal beauty strokes. On a matte base, she dusted her cheeks with the right amount of blush and contour. Glossy peach lips delivered a plump effect. Neeru chose not to go too heavy for her eye makeup resorting to mascara-coated wispy lashes and a classic winged eyeliner minus any kajal on the lids. Well-defined bushy brows rounded off her soft makeup outing. Neeru rounded off her desi princess look with side-parted hair left open in soft waves, cascading down in length."

(Images: Instagram) Sonakshi Sinha is all set to make it official with her long-term beau, actor Zaheer Iqbal on June 23. The wedding party which will be hosted at Bastian in Mumbai, will have the star couple’s family and industry friends join in the celebration. As creative individuals Sonakshi and Zaheer have charmed their way into the hearts of their fans through their respective endeavours. Ahead of their special day, the invite which has gone viral on social media features a cute image of the couple and reception party details also mention the dress code for the guests, which is formal and festive. Interestingly, the invite also suggested that the guests don’t wear red. So, will Sonakshi be wearing red to celebrate her big day? Styled by celebrity fashion stylists Sanam Ratansi and Mohit Rai on various occasions, Sonakshi has embraced the stunning, radiant red in an array of Indian as well as Western designer wear. From lehenga sets, and gowns to sarees, the hue has complemented Sonakshi with a lot of love. While we wait to see what the stunning actress will opt for on Sunday, here’s looking back at Sonakshi acing the style game in many shades of red. Lehenga Set by Payal Singhal During the promotions of Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s magnum opus series, Heeramandi, Sonakshi Sinha was styled in a magnificent dark red lehenga set designed by Payal Singhal. The dupion silk bagh embroidered choli and lehenga was paired with a mukaish organza dupatta. Sonakshi exuded royalty with a timeless allure in this traditional ensemble. Couture Gown by Ohaila Khan Sonakshi Sinha looked ravishing when she stepped out in an exclusive art deco couture gown designed by Ohaila Khan. Fitting her like a glove, the opulent gown featured 20,000 pieces of crystals. The embroidery on the shimmery, sparkling red gown took 1000 hours to create. Glamorously chic, the ensemble was further enhanced with feather detailing on the sleeves. Dramatic in red is what describes this extravagant piece of art. Choga Set by Punit Balana Simple and elegant just like Sonakshi’s aura, the surkh laal choga set is the perfect look this wedding season. Designed by Punit Balana, this classic ensemble features a bell-sleeved choga (kurta), a delicate dupatta and matching pants. The kurta is adorned with exquisite applique patra work. Looking fresh as a rose, Sonakshi complements this ensemble with her enchanting smile. Cape and Sharara Set by Arpita Mehta Sonakshi is one star who has experimented with many contemporary Indian silhouettes. Minimal yet captivating, this Arpita Mehta ensemble is a true winner. The stylish, easy-breezy red cape paired with classic sharara pants, makes for a fun festive look. Saree by Anamika Khanna There’s nothing more magical than a saree in the magical shade of red. Sonakshi looked a dream in Anamika Khanna’s contemporary draped red saree. The rich texture of the embroidery, the chic styling of the saree drape, the sexy bralette and the ivory cape accentuated Sonakshi’s style quotient."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Lifestyle Desk News18.com Last Updated: June 11, 2024, 07:10 IST New Delhi, India When it comes to international travel, visa-free destinations are drawing the attention of tourists In India, summers bring a wave of nostalgia. It takes us back to our childhood days when we eagerly waited for vacations to begin. Planning family holidays during the summer season has been a tradition, offering an opportunity to explore the world and create unforgettable memories. Whether wandering on the beaches, hiking through the mountains, or relaxing amid alluring views of snowcapped hills, holidays during this season are no less than escapades from the heat. Summer travel trend in India This year, Indians are travelling more than ever before. In 2024, we expect 57% of travellers to plan a domestic trip and 43% will prefer long international vacations. As compared to the 2019 levels, domestic air passenger traffic has already surged by 21% above 2019 levels, whereas international travel spiked by 4%. These statistics imply that people have a strong desire to travel and explore the world despite the intense heat waves and soaring temperatures. And it’s not just domestic places but international destinations are piquing their interest equally. Rikant Pittie, Co-Founder, EaseMyTrip, says, “People are looking for options to escape the heat and relax while enjoying picturesque views, natural beauty, and diverse experiences. Summer is the peak season, and travel packages have increased in digital digits. Economy and premium economy are the most availed flight categories, and travellers prefer booking three-star properties for stays owing to their amenities and economical price points. However, with the spike in airfares, they are resorting to alternative modes of travel like Vande Bharat and buses. Several trends like coolcations, spiritual tourism, recreational vacations, and adventure tourism are gaining popularity this season. “ Domestic travel on the rise During the summer season, people prefer choosing destinations with pleasant climates to beat the heat and picturesque landscapes for a relaxing vacation, offering all the services at affordable pricing. “In India, Goa, with its sunkissed beaches and vibrant nightlife, continues to remain the favourite of travellers, being the top searched and booked destination. Lakshadweep and Nandi Hills stand second and third, respectively, on the travellers’ list. Additionally, Udaipur and Rishikesh, offering a wide array of cultural and traditional experiences, are also preferred by them,” adds Pittie. International trips are constant When it comes to international travel, visa-free destinations are drawing the attention of tourists. Thailand and Sri Lanka remain the favourites. Additionally, Abu Dhabi, Phuket, Singapore, Bali, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur are the most searched and booked destinations. However, Baku (Azerbaijan), Almaty (Kazakhstan), and Nagoya (Japan) are making it to the list of options and are receiving traction in terms of search queries. Moreover, with the recent trend of multi-entry Schengen visas, European destinations occupy a prominent position in the summer travel destinations list. Amsterdam, Singapore, London, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Frankfurt, and Munich are the top destinations that Indian travellers are visiting this summer season. Coolcations to beat the heat Nowadays, summer travel and coolcations are synonymous. Just when temperatures soar, tourists prefer vacationing in cooler and colder destinations. Hence, Leh Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Kashmir, Kerala, Coorg, and the Northeast regions are the most booked tour packages this year. But this year, there’s an altogether new trend. Pittie opines, “We are now witnessing the boom of destination dupes. The concept revolves around travellers opting to visit hidden gems, less crowded and less expensive locations similar to that of their international counterparts. For instance, Gulmarg and Khajjiar are preferred as alternatives to the Swiss Alps, Andaman’s beaches over Phuket, and sprawling tea estates in Munnar bear a strong resemblance to the Cameron Highlands in Malaysia.” Spiritual tourism for inner peace With spiritual tourism gaining popularity, Ayodhya has also seen a surge in search volumes owing to the Ram Mandir inauguration. “In May, there has been a significant 102% Y-o-Y increase in searches for religious destinations like Ayodhya, Ujjain, Badrinath, and Amarnath. An increasing desire for religious exploration and the search for inner peace is reshaping the travel industry and holds a considerable share of bookings for summer travel. Amritsar has the lion’s share in terms of flight searches, with a 22-25% increase for May 2024 as compared to last year. Varanasi, Puri, and Tirupati follow next, observing a high volume of flight searches,” shares Pittie. Known for their historical significance and deep-rooted cultural traditions, they offer unique travel experiences, culinary delights, luxurious wellness amenities, and spiritual immersions. This year, not just family vacations but solo trips are also showing a rise. In fact, a certain percentage of tourists are also going for drivecations for weekend getaways. However, travel buffs and enthusiasts are opting for immersive, adrenaline-filled experiences like glamping, ski plane tours, paragliding, parasailing, etc. Moreover, the market of health-conscious travellers is increasing. Hence, there has been a rise in demand for wellness retreats and rejuvenating vacations. From yoga sessions in Rishikesh to meditative and recreational retreats in the Swiss Alps, tourists are willing to travel anywhere to seek rejuvenation. Pittie believes, “The Indian travel landscape is booming and this year is going to mark a milestone in its journey. With the rising urge to travel and have exposure to immersive experiences, the summer season travel industry is poised to flourish with a notable surge in searches and bookings by tourists. However, since there is a high demand, it’s advisable to stay updated with the best prices and deals to plan your vacations well in advance and avoid last-minute bookings that will lead to surcharges in airfares and hotels.” It could be a trip to the cool mountains, self-discovery journeys to pilgrimage destinations, or the nightlife at tropical beaches, travel today is not just about exploring a destination but about embracing the enriching experiences that come along with it. This season, summer travel is about escaping the heat. But it’s also about fulfilling the desire for a rejuvenating holiday, providing opportunities for global exploration and self-discovery."

(Image: Shutterstock) One of the best parts of summer is a delicious piece of chilled watermelon. While most people are content to eat a plain slice of melon straight after cutting it, some prefer a little extra: salt. Sprinkling salt over watermelon may seem like a strange pairing, but the combination of sweet and salty makes it a no-brainer. Consider popular dynamic duos such as salted caramel, peanut butter, or any other delicacy that gets a blast of salt to highlight the sweetness. But why does salt pair so well with watermelon? Continue reading to learn how salt can enhance the flavour of a variety of fruits, not only watermelon. What effect does salt have on watermelon? Watermelon, particularly those that are somewhat underripe or simply not very good, has a small note of bitterness and tartness beneath the sweetness. Salt naturally cuts through the bitter overtones, allowing the sweetness to shine through and become the star of each bite. The texture of watermelon is additionally enhanced by adding salt. All the liquid rises to the surface of the fruit that is high in water when a small amount of salt is added. Every bite is therefore certain to be juicy and sweet. To give this process some time to start, some individuals even salt their watermelon slices, wait a few minutes, and then start eating. There are also some health benefits. Salt (commonly known as sodium) is a naturally occurring electrolyte. Electrolytes help you keep hydrated and maintain your body’s fluid equilibrium. Adding a pinch of salt to watermelon will boost the fruit’s moisturising properties. How Do You Eat Watermelon With Salt? Now that you’re convinced, all you need to do is add a pinch of salt. Begin with the least amount possible and gradually increase to your liking. All you have to do is sprinkle salt on top of your watermelon slice, let it alone for a few minutes, and enjoy! You can also go creative. Drizzle a little honey over your salted watermelon for a wonderfully delicious treat. For a citrusy boost, pour some fresh lime juice across your salted watermelon."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Swati Chaturvedi News18.com Last Updated: June 18, 2024, 22:59 IST New Delhi, India Mango Mania and Lady In Pink cocktail The culinary landscape is undergoing a significant transformation as the trend towards diverse international cuisines and innovative cocktails gains momentum. This evolution is characterized by the fusion of different culinary traditions and the inventive use of ingredients in both food and beverages, reflecting the increasing globalization and cultural blending in the food and beverage industry. One of the most prominent trends is fusion cuisine, where elements from various culinary traditions are creatively combined to produce new and unique dishes. Udit Bagga, founder, Zylo By Kakapo, notes, “Examples include Korean-Mexican tacos, sushi burritos, and Indian-Chinese entrees. Alongside this, there is a growing demand for regional authenticity as diners seek genuine and immersive dining experiences, such as Mexican Oaxacan cuisine, Chinese Sichuan cuisine, and Spanish Basque cuisine.” Coastal Cuisines: A World of Flavors Coastal cuisines from around the world are renowned for their distinct and lively flavors. Satish Bhatia, founder, The Malabar Coast, highlights some regional delights, “In India, Chettinad cuisine is known for its spicy and aromatic dishes, such as Chettinad Pepper Chicken, which has a powerful blend of spices. Mangalorean cuisine, which features rich coconut-based curries like Mangalorean Fish Curry, strikes a balance between spice and creaminess. Kerala cuisine, highlighted by Kerala Prawn Curry, blends coconut milk, curry leaves, and spices to create a delectable experience. Andhra cuisine is known for its hot flavors, such as Andhra Fish Pulusu, an acidic tamarind-based curry. Sri Lankan cuisine, including dishes like Sri Lankan Crab Curry, provides a tantalizing mix of spices and coconut, creating a rich and aromatic flavor profile.” Internationally, coastal cuisines also offer a plethora of unique flavors. Bhatia adds, “Thailand’s Tom Yum soup integrates sour, spicy, and savory notes to create a rich and lively dish. Italy’s Risotto al Mare combines the mildly salty taste of fresh seafood with creamy rice for a delectable feast. Spain’s Paella, with its saffron and seafood, is a powerful and aromatic dish, while Peru’s Ceviche, marinated in citrus juices, is refreshing and zesty.” Health and Sustainability in Culinary Trends Health and environmental sustainability are also key drivers of this trend, leading to a rise in plant-based and sustainable eating. “Vegan versions of traditional cuisines like Italian pasta, Thai curries, and Middle Eastern falafel are becoming increasingly popular,” says Bagga. “Additionally, street food is influencing conventional culinary traditions, with chefs drawing inspiration from global street vendors to create popular dishes like Japanese takoyaki, Indian chaat, and Middle Eastern shawarma. Comfort cuisine with a twist is another significant trend, where traditional comfort foods are reimagined with cosmopolitan flavors and ingredients, resulting in dishes like Korean fried chicken, ramen burgers, and truffle poutine.” Innovative Cocktails: Blending Tradition and Modernity In the realm of innovative cocktails, craft and artisanal cocktails are gaining popularity. Bagga explains, “These drinks feature artisanal spirits, handcrafted syrups, and fresh ingredients. Examples include cocktails made with small-batch gins, aged rums, and handcrafted bitters. Botanical and herbal infusions are also on the rise, adding unique flavors and health benefits to drinks like gin and tonics with rosemary and lavender, and cocktails infused with turmeric and ginger.” The increased focus on health and fitness has led to a surge in low- and no-ABV (alcohol by volume) cocktails. “This includes mocktails, spritzers with low-alcohol vermouth, and non-alcoholic spirits,” says Bagga. “Sustainability is a major trend in cocktail creation, with bartenders emphasizing eco-friendly practices and reducing waste by using locally sourced ingredients, avoiding single-use plastics, and incorporating upcycled components.” Innovative cocktails are also incorporating coastal ingredients, adding new dimensions to mixology. Bhatia describes some unique concoctions: “The Kokum Cooler combines kokum, a tart tropical fruit, with gin and mint for a refreshing and unique drink perfect for a summer evening. The Coastal Coconut Mojito is a twist on the classic mojito, using fresh coconut water and rum for a smooth, tropical flavor. The Spiced Mango Margarita mixes juicy mangoes with a hint of chili, blending sweetness and spice for a delightful experience.” A Future of Culinary Innovation These trends reflect broader cultural movements toward sustainability, health consciousness, and a desire for authentic and unique experiences. As the culinary landscape continues to evolve, we can expect even more innovative and diverse options in international cuisines and cocktails, catering to the ever-changing preferences and values of modern consumers. The fusion of international coastal cuisines and innovative cocktails is not just about blending flavors but also about enhancing the dining experience by bringing together the best of tradition and modernity. By incorporating regional components in both food and beverages, chefs and mixologists are creating a delightful journey through global culinary cultures, ensuring a perfect balance of tradition and innovation."

When thinking about Dubai, the first thing that comes to our mind is Burj Khalifa. This magnificent skyscraper is known for its tall height that captures the imagination of all who see it. Building it must have posed significant challenges due to Dubai’s sandy landscape, where the stability of buildings is a concern. Whether you’ve seen it in person or on television and social media, its iconic view is surely unforgettable. But do you know who owns this skyscraper in Dubai? And do you know which company built it? Many people might be surprised by the answers. Facts About Burj Khalifa The construction began in January 2004 with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. It stands at an impressive 828 meters (2,716.5 feet) and boasts 163 floors. It was officially inaugurated in January 2010. It holds several world records such as the title of the tallest building, tallest free-standing structure, highest number of stories, highest occupied floor, highest outdoor observation deck, elevator with the longest travel distance and the highest service elevator. Apart from being the world’s tallest building, Burj Khalifa has also broken two other major records: The tallest structure, which was previously the KVLY-TV mast in North Dakota and the tallest free-standing structure, replacing Toronto’s CN Tower. Who Owns It And Who Constructed? The Burj Khalifa is owned by Emaar Properties, a real estate development company owned by Mohamed Kajoor Alabbar. But it was built by three major companies including Samsung C&T of South Korea, Arabtech of the United Arab Emirates and BESIX of Belgium. Emaar is one of the largest real estate companies in the world and is known for several large-scale projects including the Dubai Mall, the planned Dubai Creek Tower and the Dubai Fountain. The Burj Khalifa was designed with sustainability in mind. Every year, it collects 15 million gallons of water, which is managed and used to irrigate the building’s plants. One of the most surprising facts about the Burj Khalifa is that the tip of the skyscraper is visible from 95 kilometres away!"

    "article_content": "Curated By : Lifestyle Desk Local News Desk Last Updated: June 22, 2024, 17:08 IST Delhi, India Sunscreen is a must for everyone. In this scorching heat, you may be using scarves and hats to protect yourself from the sun. But don’t skip using sunscreen, as it plays an important role in protecting the skin from harsh rays. Be it men or women, it has become necessary for everyone to use it to protect their skin. It is advisable to apply sunscreen in every season. But its need increases more in the summer season. If you go out of the house even for a short while, you get tanned and sunburned. Sunscreen is necessary to protect the skin from damage caused by the strong rays of the sun. Today, we will let you know which sunscreen is best for men. According to a study, men are less likely than women to use sunscreen. If some of them use it, then they are very confused while buying sunscreen. They do not even understand which one to choose from SPF 15, 30, 50 and 100. Let us tell you that SPFs are always written on the sunscreen box or packet. SPF means Sun Protection Factor. That is, the higher the SPF of the sunscreen, the more it will prevent ultraviolet rays from reaching the skin. If you think that people with dark skin do not need sunscreen, then this is wrong. Sunscreen is necessary for every type of skin. You will find thousands of sunscreens on the market. But, some sunscreens are very smooth and absorbing. You can read the description mentioned on the pack while purchasing the sunscreen. Also keep in mind that if your skin is sensitive, then definitely consult a doctor before going for any product. A cosmetic dermatologist, Jaishree Sharad, highlighted the benefits of sunscreen and said, “You don’t need to do anything else; just apply sunscreen. You will see the change. It’s not like that you will receive a response in just a month, but apply it regularly for two years and see the change in your skin colour. All these things are possible if you follow it regularly.”"

Foods high in phosphorus: Poorly functioning kidneys have difficulty regulating phosphorus levels. This leads to weak bones and skin irritation. Dairy products, nuts and processed foods are high in phosphorus and should be avoided by those with kidney disease. Processed meats: Processed meats contain a lot of extra sodium and harmful substances such as phosphates that accelerate kidney damage. So choose lean meats if possible and make sure they are fresh. Sugary foods: Eating too much sugar can make diabetes worse. It can also make chronic kidney disease worse. Natural sugar should be consumed in moderation and sugary drinks should be avoided. Caffeine and alcohol: Both dehydrate the body and put a strain on the kidneys. Therefore, avoid caffeine and alcohol as much as possible to maintain kidney function."

Unlike women, who are born with a limited number of eggs, men produce new sperm every day. The testicles produce around 100-200 million new sperm every day, so men are not at risk of running out of sperm as they age. The decline in male fertility can be caused by various factors, including medical conditions, environmental factors, lifestyle and age. Dr Archana Dhawan Bajaj, Gynecologist, Obstetrician and IVF Expert, at Nurture IVF Clinic, New Delhi said that various medical conditions can affect sperm production or the ejaculation process. These include infections such as epididymitis, anatomical problems such as varicocele (swelling of the veins that drain the testicles and can affect sperm production) and problems with sperm delivery. Chromosomal abnormalities that result in abnormal development of the male reproductive organs, problems with intercourse or ejaculation such as erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation or painful intercourse, and DNA fragmentation (in which the DNA in the sperm is abnormal, increasing the risk of failed conception or miscarriage) are also important medical causes. Environmental and medical history factors can also contribute to the decline in fertility. Certain medications, including testosterone replacement therapy, cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation, some antifungal drugs and medications for ulcers can affect sperm production. Previous surgeries such as hernia repairs, scrotal or testicular surgery, prostate surgery or vasectomies can block the path of sperm. Excessive exposure to industrial chemicals, heavy metals or radiation can also affect fertility. Lifestyle choices play a crucial role in male fertility. The use of illegal drugs such as anabolic steroids, cocaine or marijuana, and habits such as drinking alcohol and smoking contribute to lower sperm counts. Obesity can have a direct impact on sperm and cause hormonal changes that affect fertility. The decline in male fertility with age is not as dramatic as in women, but it is still significant. Studies show that the chances of not becoming a father increase as a man gets older and pregnancy rates decrease. For example, men over 40 are 30 per cent less likely to achieve fatherhood within a year than men under 30. Men over 45 take an average of five times longer to achieve parenthood than men under 25. For men over 35, the rate is 25 per cent, compared to 52 per cent for men under 35."

The mom-to-be actress, Deepika Padukone left her fans floored after she finally shared some breathtaking pictures of herself on social media with her baby bump. The actress dropped some monochrome clicks that showcased her obvious radiant glow and effortless style game as she stunned everyone in a black ensemble with a slit in the back and accentuating her figure. While all eyes were on a dazzling smile, stylish attire and the baby bump, you might have noticed her in matching black stilettoes. This brings light to the question of whether women should wear heels during their pregnancy. Reportedly, the actress is due in three months and will be embracing motherhood in September. In a pre-release event, she was spotted wearing an in-vogue outfit and high heels. But she is not the first actress to wear so. But this does raise questions about safety during pregnancy. Even if you are not pregnant, heels do pose a certain challenge in regular wear. There might be a risk of swollen feet, twisting ankles, sprain and falling. In such a situation, doctors advise moms-to-be to wear comfortable footwear. Wearing heels for a long time can cause pain in the spine, and legs and even in some cases lead to premature labour pain. Mumbai’s famous gynaecologist, Dr Ganesh Shinde shared, “If you are wearing heels during this (pregnancy) time, then do not wear them for a long time.” He also advised against wearing extremely high heels and instead recommended wearing footwear with soft and cushioned soles. Wearing high heels for a long time can cause the calf muscles to cramp. The expert further added that mums-to-be should avoid wearing heels after the fifth month of pregnancy. As the pregnancy advances, the weight of the mother’s body increases. This can further cause strain on the legs, especially the ankles and the feet. Experts have often recommended alternatives to pointed heels as well. If one does not like flats but still wants to wear heels, it is better to opt for wedges or platform heels during pregnancy. It helps in the weight distribution. It should be worn only for a short period."

She further states that omega 3 is a type of fatty acid, which helps in boosting our immunity. She revealed, “Egg yolk is richer in protein as compared to fat content.” Giving more information in the caption, Dr Priyanka writes, “Eating whole egg provides a balanced amount of protein, vitamins and minerals.” Furthermore, the best time to consume an egg is breakfast, while eating one to two eggs daily is considered to be a very healthy option. The Healthline website states that an egg contains Choline, a nutrient many are not even aware of. As per the information given, it is needed in the formation of the cell membrane and also helps in the production of signalling molecules in the brain.

    "article_content": "Curated By : Lifestyle Desk Local News Desk Last Updated: June 22, 2024, 18:11 IST Delhi, India In friendship, people do not judge each other. Friendship is a very special thing for many of us. We often share our sadness, happiness, joy and grief with our friends. While some friends stay for a lifetime, some friendships last for only for few years or days. We often trust our friends blindly but some of them try to take advantage of our trust. It is very important to understand who are our real friends and who are our fake friends. Here are seven signs to identify whether your friend is your real friend or fake: Judging: In friendship, people do not judge each other. They understand each other’s circumstances and mindset while helping each other in life. If you have a friend who often judges you, then it might not be a true friendship. Not being happy for your success or achievement: True friends usually celebrate each other’s achievements and happiness. If your friend is jealous of your achievements and success, they might not be real friends. Making fun of personal matters: Teasing is a very common thing in a friendship. But if your friend makes fun of your matters in front of them then it is a red flag. You should always try to maintain distance from such friends. Gossiping about your secrets: Trust is one of the most essential things in friendship. If a friend gossips and shares your secrets with others which you have said out of trust then it is a red flag. It is better to stay away from such friends. Not caring for you: True friends always care for each other, even when they are far away. If you are in a friendship where the other person doesn’t care about you and your feelings then it is better to distance yourself from them. Hiding important information: Some people come to make friends only for their good. Some friends only take important information like job vacancies from you and hide the other information. Such people might not be your true friends. Making Excuses: It is often said that a friend in need is a friend indeed but if your friends make excuses when you are in any problem instead of helping then you should understand that it is not a true friendship."

Sometimes water leaks from the hand shower of the toilet. While using the toilet, the water suddenly flows out sometimes very fast and sometimes very slowly. This also leads to water wastage. There is also a problem in using it. The water comes out without pressing the jet. Sometimes buying a low-quality product also leads to it getting damaged quickly. If the hand shower of your toilet is also leaking, you can try some of the things mentioned here to make it work temporarily. How to Fix a Leaking Hand Shower in a Toilet? 1. If you have recently replaced the hand shower of the toilet and it is leaking again, then you might have bought a cheap product. A product from a good company will not spoil so quickly. If the leakage problem is temporary and you don’t have time to go to the market for a few days, then don’t worry. You can solve this problem without spending any money. Make a small ball of polythene and place it on the leaking part from where the water is coming out. If the water is coming out of the nozzle sprayer pipe, you can also attach a cloth there. If these tricks do not work, it is best to buy a new one otherwise water will continue to be wasted. 2. Sometimes the water does not come out properly from all the holes of the hand shower. Some holes are clogged. Only four to five jets of water come out. This does not allow proper cleaning after using the toilet. You can open the holes by inserting a safety pin. Sometimes the water does not come out even after pressing properly because of the dirt stuck. 3. Sometimes water drips from the tap part of the hand shower. It means the nozzle is fine, you need to keep the tap closed. Open the tap when you use it, otherwise the water will drip drop by drop throughout the day."

In this article, we will dive into a detailed roadmap of your body’s hidden hot spots to unlock new realms of intimacy. You know the obvious hot spots, but there are so many more erogenous zones that can seriously up your pleasure game. We’re talking secret spots that can take your sexy time from the back of your knees to the nape of your neck. We’ll explore oft-overlooked areas that can seriously intensify arousal when touched just right. With some guided experimentation and a spirit of playful curiosity, you and your partner can discover new paths to pleasure. This roadmap will open your eyes to a whole new world of sensual possibilities. Erogenous zones are areas of the body that are highly sensitive to sexual stimulation. These hotspots are packed with nerve endings that send waves of pleasure, coursing through you, when caressed or touched. Getting familiar with your erogenous zones can unlock new realms of intimacy and self-exploration. Your erogenous zones can vary in intensity and location based on your unique physiology and mindset. Some may be consistent turn-ons, while others might only ignite on certain occasions. You’ve heard of erogenous zones, but what’s really going on? The science is all about specialised nerve endings and pathways in your brain. A Neurological Phenomenon : Your body is covered in different types of nerve receptors that send signals to your somatosensory cortex – the part of your brain that processes touch and bodily sensations. Some areas, like your lips and genitals, are packed with extra nerve bundles. This overload of sensory input translates into heightened sensitivity and pleasure potential. Mind Over Matter: Erogenous potential is also heavily influenced by your mindset and mood. Stress, anxiety, or negative body image can create psychological blocks that dull sensations. But when you’re relaxed, present, and feeling yourself, even a light graze can feel electric. The mind-body connection works both ways, too. Physical stimulation of an erogenous zone activates the dopamine pathways linked to pleasure, arousal, and reward. So, focusing on hotspots doesn’t just feel good; it can boost your mood and desire. The key is tuning into your unique body map and its constellation of hot spots. Communicate what feels good to your partner, and vice versa. With some exploration, you may uncover entirely new erogenous frontiers waiting to be claimed. Remember, every body is different. Exploring each other’s unique erogenous zones can unlock new realms of intimacy and pleasure. While the usual erogenous zones are great, exploring new territory can lead to thrilling new sensations and deeper intimacy. Approach it with patience, communication and an open mind. Take the time to really get to know your own body and what uniquely turns you on. Then have fun sharing those discoveries with someone special. Be playful, be present, follow the pleasure and see where it leads you. The possibilities are endless when you tune in and explore all of your erogenous possibilities."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Akshata Shetty Edited By: Shreeja Bhattacharya News18.com Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 19:51 IST New Delhi, India Vaishali Shadangule has created more than 30 looks for her collection, Satori. A pioneer in textile wearable art, Vaishali Shadangule has been weaving a sustainable story with her collections. The signature cording and draping styles are all set to come alive once again in her new collection, Satori. The Fall/Winter 2024 line will be presented on June 24 during Paris Haute Couture Week at Solum Pairs, Pont Alexandre III, Rive Gauche. With more than 30 looks created for the collection, Vaishali aims to celebrate her Indian roots with a blend of sustainable and contemporary aesthetics inspired by nature. Couture, cording and creativity have been Vaishali’s forte when it comes to runway shows and with Satori, Vaishali aims to create an ‘ahah’ moment through the collection. So with the signature seamless sense of flow, there is a sudden enlightenment that will embrace each design on the runway. Couture, cording and creativity have been your forte when it comes to runway shows, what inspires you every time you sit down to ideate? It is always Nature. By “observing” Nature, and “feeling” her energy, I realise layers of what happens within me and in the world. We are all children of the same energy and by a combined seeing and feeling Nature we can capture the essence of things. By reflecting on this, I represent on my canvas (my garments) what I feel. You can see that often my representations are very abstract because they just want to share my feelings. Models walked barefoot at your last Paris show that beautifully resonated with the theme of your collection ‘I am nature’. This year, as you redirect your creative journey, how do you plan to celebrate your roots in this new vision? My roots are always there everywhere in one or the other form. Starting from my fabrics which are only handwoven in Indian villages. And that for me is the real celebration and the core of all my activity. All the rest is choreography for the main mission. This year the sustainable side will be important and visible. In our villages we do not throw away anything, and I consider this a very strong trait of our roots. Surface texturing combined with an array of colours have always been a highlight of your collection, are there any new additions this season? Oh yes, this season there is one big addition, you will notice it immediately. And it is quite interesting how I created this technique for my interiors line, and from there how it translated in my fashion line. Even here the process has been revolutionised. Showcasing on a global platform, are there any lessons you have learnt over the years and would like to share with aspiring designers who want to showcase at international fashion weeks? Oh, so many learnings from each international platform and from each season on each platform. I would say to showcase successfully at an international platform you must keep quality at the maximum, and you have to be yourself with as much as a strong distinguishing character as possible."

Sonakshi Sinha celebrated her marriage with Zaheer Iqbal in a quintessential vintage saree and jewellery from her mother, Poonam Sinha’s wardrobe. The ivory embroidered saree exuded minimalism and enhanced Sonakshi’s bridal glow. Borrowing your mom’s favourite saree or jewellery is not a new tradition, however, incorporating it on your wedding day is an emotional and precious moment. In Bollywood, Sonakshi is not the only one who has borrowed something beautiful from their mom’s wardrobe, celebrities such as Yami Gautam too draped her mom’s saree on her wedding day. Similarly, Parineeti Chopra repurposed her nani’s challa and included it in her bridal look. Sonam Kapoor Ahuja styled her bridal red lehenga with her mom, Sunita Kapoor’s traditional jewellery. Kareena Kapoor Khan who got married to Saif Ali Khan, restored her mother-in-law, Sharmila Tagore, bridal sharara ensemble and wore it for her wedding. Similarly, as per reports Priyanka Chopra included a piece of Nick Jonas’ mother’s wedding gown sewn into her own Ralph Lauren wedding gown. Here’s looking at celebrity brides who borrowed from their family heirlooms on their wedding day. Sonam Kapoor Ahuja Style icon and actor Sonam Kapoor got married to Anand Ahuja in 2018. For the Anand Karaj ceremony, Sonam enhanced her Anuradha Vakil red ensemble with timeless jewellery from her mom, Sunita Kapoor’s collection. The vintage statement jewellery pieces adorned by Sonam exuded royalty, making her one of the most beautiful Indian brides. Parineeti Chopra Parineeti Chopra wanted to pay a heartfelt tribute to her nani, who used to wear a challa in her saree with the keys, a symbol of being the lady of the house. For Parineeti, the sound of the challa when her nani walked around the house, was a melody of strength and grace. And that’s when Manish Malhotra who designed the statement piece knew he had to add that piece of legacy to her lehenga. Yami Gautam Yami Gautam married filmmaker Aditya Dhar in an intimate wedding ceremony in Himachal Pradesh. Yami looked radiant in a deep red silk saree with intricate threadwork. Interestingly, the saree Yami draped on her special day belonged to her mother. Keeping it simple and timeless, Yami looked ethereal as a bride. Handcrafted with love, the sari featured an array of motifs and was paired with an embellished red veil which added sparkle to her overall look"

As Pride Month unfolds across the globe, it serves as a poignant reminder of the ongoing struggle for equality, acceptance, and celebration of diversity within the LGBTQ+ community. Originating from the Stonewall Riots in June 1969, Pride Month has evolved into a time of reflection, activism, and joyous festivities that honor the progress made and highlight the challenges that still lie ahead. In this spirit of inclusivity and solidarity, beauty brands worldwide are stepping up to champion the LGBTQ+ cause, not just through symbolic gestures but with meaningful actions that resonate within their organizations and beyond. Redefining Beauty Standards For Swiss Beauty, inclusivity is not just a buzzword but a guiding principle embedded in their ethos. Mohit Goyal, Co-Founder and Managing Director, emphasizes, “India is a melting pot of diverse cultures and orientations, and Swiss Beauty embodies this spirit of inclusivity.” Their #GlassItGlossIt campaign exemplifies this commitment by featuring a diverse array of models, including transgender icons Ojas Rajani and Nitasha Biswas, alongside male and female models. This campaign challenges conventional beauty norms, celebrating individuality regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Goyal further adds, “Swiss Beauty stands proudly with the LGBTQIA+ community, celebrating the progress we’ve made together while recognizing the journey ahead.” Through initiatives like #GlassItGlossIt, Swiss Beauty aims to nurture an environment where everyone feels seen, heard, and valued, reaffirming their dedication to inclusivity and diversity not only during Pride Month but every day. Enacting Change Through Action At The Body Shop India, Pride Month is a call to action rooted in their commitment to inclusivity and acceptance. Harmeet Singh, Chief Brand Officer, highlights, “Celebrating Pride Month isn’t just about symbolic gestures for us; it’s about enacting tangible change.” Recently, they conducted an immersive workshop on diversity and inclusion, fostering a workplace where every individual feels respected and valued. Singh elaborates, “From our inclusive hiring practices to comprehensive training programs, gender sensitivity is at the heart of what we do.” With 10 team members proudly representing the LGBTQ+ community, The Body Shop India exemplifies their dedication to fostering a safe and welcoming environment. Their Youth Collective Council further amplifies this commitment by empowering India’s emerging change-makers to shape business practices with a strong focus on diversity and inclusivity. Ms. Singh invites others to join them on this journey towards a more inclusive future, where diversity in all its forms is celebrated and valued. A Call for Unity and Progress As Pride Month unfolds, these initiatives underscore the importance of not only celebrating diversity but actively promoting inclusion and equality. From challenging beauty norms to fostering inclusive workplaces, these brands exemplify how the beauty industry can be a catalyst for positive change. In conclusion, Pride Month serves as a powerful reminder that the fight for equality and acceptance continues. It is a time to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community’s resilience, honor their contributions, and recommit ourselves to building a more inclusive society where everyone can thrive, regardless of who they are or whom they love. Let us stand together in solidarity, today and every day, to create a world where diversity is celebrated, and everyone feels proud of who they are."

In the pictures, Deepika is seen in a form-fitting dress with a slit in the back, perfectly accentuating her elegant silhouette. The dress is none other than the Loewe Anagram Pebble Maxi dress in cotton, priced at AED 4650. The Anagram Pebble Dress in cotton by LOEWE epitomizes the brand’s blend of sophistication and modern design. Its slim fit and long length radiate understated elegance, complemented by wide straps at the front that introduce a contemporary flair. Featuring an Anagram-engraved pebble embellishment, this black dress subtly highlights the brand’s iconic motif, making it a timeless staple for any wardrobe. Padukone completes her look with a pair of sleek Magda Butrym black thin pumps, which cost 497 USD. These pumps add a touch of classic elegance to her outfit, enhancing the overall chic vibe. The black buffed leather heels feature a pointed toe, a wraparound self-tie ankle strap, and a covered stiletto heel with a rubber injection for added stability. Her choice of accessories is equally impeccable. She adorned herself with minimal yet stunning jewelry, keeping the focus on her dress and her baby bump. Her hair, styled in a messy ponytail, adds a casual, effortless charm to the look, while her radiant smile and natural glow steal the show. Sharing these precious moments, Deepika captioned the photos, “Okay enough…Now I’m hungry!” This playful and candid caption adds a personal touch to the otherwise high-fashion post, endearing her even more to her fans. A post shared by दीपिका पादुकोण (@deepikapadukone) Deepika Padukone in Kalki 2898 AD Interestingly, Deepika’s latest role in the upcoming film “Kalki 2898 AD” mirrors her real-life journey. In the film, she plays a character who is also pregnant, carrying a child who might be Kalki. Introduced as SUM-80 or Maa (Amma in Telugu) in the film’s trailer, her character is central to the plot. Amitabh Bachchan’s character Aswatthama vows to protect her child from Kamal Haasan’s character, Supreme Yaskin/Kali’s clutches. The film will also feature Prabhas as Bhairava, a bounty hunter determined to bring her back to the Complex, from which she presumably escapes. Whether on-screen or off, Deepika Padukone’s fashion moments are always a delight, and her latest look is no exception."

However, his untimely death left fans and family sad. On this special day, his mother Charan Kaur took to her social handle and penned an emotional note remembering the singer. She has written in the Punjabi language which reads, “Happy birthday son, on this day, my wishes and prayers came true when I held you for the first time, felt in the warmth of the bosom. And I came to know that Akal Purakh gave me a son. Blessings. I hope you know there was a slight redness on the small feet, who did not know that these small steps had travelled the whole world while sitting in the village, and thick eyes with which you would see and recognize the truth. They did not know that you were giving the generation of Punjab a different view of the world.” A post shared by Charan Kaur (@charan_kaur5911) The post further reads, “Gone will be your pen, which was the identity of these qualities, which was held by your illusion-like small hands, which I did not know, that these hands had the ability to change the ages, and the head holding a precious crown like a turban had illusionary hair, which I did not know when I would tickle for the last time. If at that time the Akal Purakh had told me that the son of whom I had become a mother, he was born to guide the world to follow the path of truth and righteousness, I would have written the conspiracies and attacks in your account as my own. I would have written the parts, son. Of course, you don’t walk me around, see, I always feel you around me, son, be happy wherever you are, this is what I pray for on your birthday. I miss you so much today.” In an unfortunate incident, Sidhu Moose Wala was shot dead at Punjab’s Jawaharke village of Mansa district on May 29 last year."

The stars that did Punjabi films in earlier times like Yusuf Sahab Raj Kapoor ji knew Punjabi…so it was quite natural for them to speak Punjabi. In my case, Punjabi is not my first language, but I would love to do it given a chance.”"

    "article_content": "Reported By : Titas Chowdhury News18.com Last Updated: July 01, 2023, 08:38 IST Mumbai, India Sonam Bajwa's latest release Carry On Jatta 3 co-starring Gippy Grewal has broken records with its day one collections. Five years after Carry On Jatta 2 (2018), Carry On Jatta 3 hit the big screen this Thursday (June 29), which sees Gippy Grewal and Sonam Bajwa revisiting their characters. The comic caper set new records for the Punjabi film industry as it clocked more Rs 10 crore at the worldwide box office on its first day, thus emerging as the biggest day-one grosser. The trailer of the film gave a glimpse into a series of comically chaotic situations that a Punjabi family settled in London gets embroiled in. Speaking about the film, Sonam, in an exclusive chat with News18 a while back, said that the USP of the film ‘is the madness, laughter and confusion in a Punjabi household where the father is confused about who his son is dating’. A post shared by Sonam Bajwa (@sonambajwa) The film might have Sonam playing a glamorous young girl who essays the hero’s love interest but going forward, she wants to be a part of a certain number of women-led narratives apart from the usual commercial films. “I shall keep pushing myself and ever year, I intend to do one or two films that are female-oriented. After Guddiyan Patole (2019), I get so many scripts every year which are female-centric. Times have changed. I hope the situation keeps getting better and better,” she said. The Punjabi film industry has gained popularity through its male superstars like Gippy, Diljit Dosanjh and Ammy Virk, who enjoy a massive fandom even globally. But Sonam believes even amid their shadows, women actors have the potential and opportunity to be a part of some important stories and make a statement. “If a film is made well, whether it’s female-centric or not, it will work. It’s just that a female-centric film might not have a budget like a film that has a male superstar. In both Ardab Mutiyaran (2019) and Guddiyan Patole, we had heroes who were making their debuts, and both films did well. We do have space. We just need to trust ourselves, make our way and keep doing such films. Yes, a couple of them might not work but the idea is to constantly work towards making good films. It’s challenging but it gives me a lot of hope that my films have worked,” elaborated Sonam. The Honsla Rakh (2021) actress, however, pointed out that for a female-led film to do well, it’s important that it gets a release as big as any other Punjabi film starring a male superstar. “Recently, a film came out called Kali Jotta and that performed outstandingly well, both critically and commercially. I truly believe in supporting these kinds of films. People really appreciated it. There’s a scope for actors like us and female-oriented scripts to do well too but they need to be well-made and well-placed. If a film is made well with a lot of hard work and then released properly, I don’t think that the audience would let them go without appreciating them,” she explained. For Sonam, the idea is to not be deterred by failure but to keep pushing the envelope by challenging the norm and setting new precedents. Speaking about it, she asserted, “Sometimes, we fall short in making a film nicely and then we wonder why the audience didn’t like it. But I don’t remember any film that was good but didn’t work. Sometimes, a film may not work if the audience has already seen something similar in the past. We want to make the best films and we’re all learning and growing along the way.”"

The best decision we took was to take Digpal Lanjekar as the director, there is absolutely no one better than him for a subject like this, the research and hardwork is incredible. Releasing the first film on Maharaj is a lot of pressure, but we are guaranteed to educate and entertain the audience with the masterpiece Digpal sir has created.” Take a look here: A post shared by Digpal Lanjekar (@digpalofficial) ‘Shivrayancha Chhava’ first venture to be made on a massive scale and an expensive budget, promising to add epic value to the film.

The series revolves around two worlds. The first world, where one labels people with titles of criminal connotation for being born there, and the second, which guarantees people normalcy and respect. The series features celebrated actor Jai ’s jaw-dropping performance as a lawyer aspiring to be a judge and Tanya Hope as a journalist. In an exclusive insight, Director Arunraja Kamaraj shared his motivation behind the series, “The character of the angry young man pivoted Indian entertainment as it opened the minds of the viewers to society’s anomalies for some people. We saw several variations of this too but off late, I felt the angst of the youth was missing from the screen. Through Label I once again wanted to essay a modern version of the angry young man. For him, bias and identities go hand in hand and he wants to break that cycle by being the disruptor.” Talking about stepping into the challenging role of a lawyer in Label, Jai said, “When I read the script for Label, I instantly knew Prabhakaran, my character, had fire in his heart. He is no ordinary lawyer; he does not just fight for justice but also points out how bias affects us daily. For this role, understanding the role of a lawyer in today’s world was hectic but a learning experience for me. I can now see why their lives are so incredibly tough. So, when deciding on the project, I knew it wasn’t just about playing a part; it was getting to live and experience a different side of life.” Muthamizh Padaippagam produces Hotstar Specials Label and features Dinesh Krishnan’s cinematography. Three lyricists – Mohan Raja, Logan and director Arunraja Kamaraj himself — have penned the songs for the series while the screenplay and dialogues have been penned by Jayachandra Hashmi. Label features on Disney+ Hotstar every week, with every episode dropping in on Friday. Label is available in Tamil, Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, Kannada, Telugu, and Malayalam, on Disney+ Hotstar with new episodes every Friday."

The actor shared heartwarming moments from the engagement ceremony on his social media, giving fans a glimpse of the joyous occasion. Shine Tom Chacko expressed his happiness. The couple looked radiant and deeply in love in the photos shared by the actor. The actor is seen dressed in a simple shirt paired with white pants and Thanuja is wearing a white colour gown. As The Times of India reported, their relationship rumours were always there. Shine Tom Chacko had teased fans earlier on November 7, 2023, by sharing a captivating snapshot with Thanuja on his Facebook page, sparking curiosity among all. Take a look here: A post shared by Shine Tom Chacko (@shinetomchacko_official) A few months back, Shine Tom Chacko faced massive backlash after he criticised the protagonist’s acting skills in the movie Beast. Now, he has found himself in yet another controversy after he questioned whether Thalapathy Vijay is as great an actor as Mammootty or Mohanlal. In a recent interview with a media channel, actor Shine Tom Chacko sparked controversy yet again while he addressed the topic of gender pay disparity in the industry. He shared that this is the most debated issue and further expressed that salary is not just dictated by gender or acting skills but also by the star power of an actor and their capability to attract an audience. The Malayalam actor made these remarks in response to a question regarding Thalapathy’s whopping salary compared to Lady Superstar Nayanthara’s salary. He pointed out that not every actor who has the title of Superstar needs to get similar remuneration as Thalapathy Vijay. Previously, Shine Tom Chacko made a statement about his co-star Thalapathy Vijay’s acting in Beast which left the Varisu actor’s fans angry. He discussed a scene where Thalapathy had to lift him. The Malayalam actor pointed out, “Usually, you can see the difficulty in the face when someone lifts a weight. But Vijay did not show anything like that on his face. Vijay Sir cannot be blamed for that. The film crew is the reason.” This led to Shine Tom Chacko receiving much backlash and negativity on social media."

    "article_content": "Written By : Mohammad Haris News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 14:59 IST New Delhi, India F&O trading enables investors to hedge against potential market movements, speculate on price changes, and leverage their investments. As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the Union Budget 2024-25 next month, reports are floating that the government is planning to impose higher tax on futures and options (F&O) trading. According to a Financial Express report citing sources, the government is considering two significant steps — reclassifying F&O income from ‘business income’ to ‘speculative income’, and introducing a tax-deducted-at-source (TDS) mechanism. According to the experts, shifting F&O trading from ‘business income’ to ‘speculative income’ will stop such investors from offsetting losses from other business losses, much like cryptocurrencies. This reclassification would categorise earnings from these derivatives similarly to lottery winnings or cryptocurrency investments, which are currently subject to a flat tax rate of 30 per cent. TDS will, however, help the government keep track of investors in the F&O market. Such a provision was introduced in the Budget 2023-24 also for cryptocurrencies. Here’s what is F&O trading and why the government might impose higher taxes on this in the upcoming Budget 2024-25: What is F&O Trading? Futures and options (F&O) are financial instruments that allow investors to trade contracts based on the future price of an underlying asset, such as stocks, indices, commodities, or currencies. Futures Contracts: These are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a future date. Both parties are obligated to fulfill the contract at expiry unless they close their position beforehand. Options Contracts: These give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a set price before or at the contract’s expiry. F&O trading enables investors to hedge against potential market movements, speculate on price changes, and leverage their investments. However, the high leverage involved can lead to substantial losses, making it a high-risk activity for investors. Why the Government Might Impose Higher Taxes on F&O Trading? Even as the stock market investments have become popular with the online trading apps, retail investors are more and more falling into high-risk F&O trading. This is leading to huge losses for them, leading to overall dampening of sentiments. In view of this, the government and regulators have been worried for quite some time about the increased participation of retail investors in the derivatives market. According to a stock market analyst, “Retail investors usually participate in the futures and options market by getting information on social media platforms, instead of substantive expert advice or research. This leads to huge losses for them as has been witnessed recently.” The analyst also said that by moving F&O income from ‘business income’ to ‘speculative income’ (as media reports suggest), the government aims to deter excessive speculative activity and promote more cautious trading practices. “The government favors long-term investments over short-term speculation,” said another investment expert adding that by reclassifying F&O income and introducing TDS, retail investors might be encouraged to shift towards more stable investment options like mutual funds, stocks, and bonds, fostering financial stability and wealth creation. He added that the move might also rein in market volatility as leveraged F&O trading often results in high market volatility. Also, excessive speculative trading poses systemic risks to the financial system. The expert also said the move will also align India’s F&O trading with global F&O trading rules . “In many developed countries, F&O trading income is treated differently from regular business income. For example, the US IRS Section 1256 categorises certain futures and options with distinct tax rules.”"

After several teases in the last two months, Uncle Howdy finally completed his WWE arrival. During the closing moments of RAW, the lights went off to sink the whole arena into darkness. Soon, Sister Abigail crawled out with a lamp and pointed backstage. Next, Ramblin Rabbit was revealed with Hammer, followed by Mercy the Buzzard who was sitting on top of some boxes. Huskus the Pig stood behind the screen and behind came Uncle Howdy. All the Wyatt Family members then walked towards the lamp. The Wyatt Sicks’ arrival led to a loud cheer in the arena. Bo Dallas as Uncle Howdy The fans were exhilarated to see Bo Dallas carry on his late real-life brother and WWE icon Bray Wyatt’s legacy. Bo never embraced a spooky role in the company. Hence, his arrival as Howdy surprised several of the fans. Nikki Cross as Sister Abigail Despite getting her hands on the WWE Women’s Championship in the past, Nikki Cross never really fit in as a typical prominent face. She had to flip everything, leading her to become an underdog character. Nikki is now Abigail and fans can expect an incredible debut inside the ring soon. Erick Rowan as Ramblin Rabbit Erick Rowan is the last OG member of the Wyatt Family that remains in the company. With a stable now being established, Rowan’s inclusion in the Wyatt Sicks was crucial. His new role as the Ramblin Rabbit is a powerful testament to his career. Dexter Lumis as Mercy the Buzzard WWE superstar Dexter Lumis is the fourth member of the stable. He was so excited about his new role that Lumis even shared an Instagram post showing a cool black Wyatt Sicks t-shirt after the RAW segment came to an end. Joe Gacy as Huskus the Pig Having made his debut with WWE’s developmental brand NXT in 2020, Joe Gacy finally made it to the main roster four years later. He was spotted in a pig mask as he posed alongside the other Wyatt Sicks members As for the sixth member, nothing has been confirmed by the company yet. Many fans on the internet believe that the late Bray Wyatt is the final member of the stable. But there is also a chance that Alexa Bliss could join the line-up based on early clues. Bliss had previously joined the Wyatt Family a few years back, falling under the Funhouse spell. It was believed that she would take up the role of Abigail but Bliss wound up as a different evil entity altogether. Stay updated with the latest from Euro 2024 . Explore Euro 2024 Match Today.

(Image: Shutterstock) Anxiety is a common mental health issue that impacts people of all ages, especially young children. Because of their limited ability to communicate, it can be difficult to spot anxiety in young children, but parents, caregivers and educators need to be aware of the indications and offer the right kind of assistance. Childhood anxiety disorders are characterised by intense, stubborn conduct and higher emotional responses in kids. According to a study conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), anxiety problems impact one out of every eight children. This leads to the fact that in such instances, the involvement of parents is critical because they must aid their kids in recognising and regulating their anxious feelings. Childhood Anxiety In Children: Signs And Symptoms A common symptom of anxiety problems in children is ongoing fear or worry. They even begin claiming to be ill when there is no apparent medical reason. In many cases, they also experience sleep difficulties and difficulty making judgements, even as they begin to shun the things they once enjoyed. Other symptoms that may be considered are: Anxiety In Children: Causes And Impact Several factors contribute to the development of the aforementioned symptoms, including overactive “fight or flight” responses. Children may inherit anxiety genes, which can impair brain function. This makes it more difficult for children to complete tasks such as planning ahead of time, performing chores in the correct order, and making sensible decisions. Thus, addressing childhood anxiety at a young age can assist protect their development. How Should Parents Handle The Situation? By being patient, empathic and good communicators, parents can help their children navigate tough times and develop resilience for a brighter future. They can also teach children simple relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness activities, to help them cope with worry when it arises. Furthermore, parents can motivate their children to approach their problems positively. Celebrating their achievements, no matter how modest, can help keep them motivated and energetic. Parents must teach their children to communicate their emotions honestly. Parents may help their children manage anxiety in the present by applying these measures, as well as preparing them for a happier, healthier future."

Today, a different kind of strength is being championed: the strength to prioritize your mental health. June is Men’s Health Month, a crucial reminder that men’s well-being deserves just as much focus as anyone else’s. But why the specific emphasis? Statistics paint a concerning picture. A Harvard University study had put forth how men tend to live shorter lives in comparison to women. Be it their genes, hormones, or metabolism, the study has stated some of the reasons. And generally in Indian households too, one might witness that they are less likely to visit doctors for regular checkups, often putting their health on the back burner. Redditors from time to time have dived into multiple facets that have affected Men’s Health more than ever on r/india. Let’s explore the specific health challenges men face, debunk myths about masculinity that might hinder healthcare awareness, and offer practical tips for men to take charge of their well-being. It’s time to redefine what it means to be healthy as a man – it’s about resilience, self-care, and living a long, fulfilling life. By fostering supportive communities and challenging outdated notions of masculinity, Indian men can forge a path towards a healthier and more fulfilling life. Strength isn’t just about physical prowess; it’s about the courage to prioritize mental well-being, seek help when needed, and build genuine connections. Let’s rewrite the narrative of men’s health in India, one conversation, one friendship, and one shared experience at a time."

The digital age, while bringing numerous advancements, has also introduced a slew of sleep challenges for Generation Z. From the relentless allure of social media to the pressures of academic and work life, today’s youth are grappling with significant obstacles that prevent them from achieving the restful sleep they need. The Sleep Struggles of Gen Z Uttam Malani, Executive Director, Centuary Mattress, highlights that Gen Z’s digital lifestyle is a major contributor to their sleep difficulties. “The constant allure of social media, long working hours, work stress, and traffic often prevent many from getting adequate rest,” he notes. This lack of quality sleep can lead to cognitive impairments, mood swings, and even chronic health conditions. P V Shyam Sundar, Founder Director, Evolv28, echoes these sentiments, pointing to the disruptions caused by constant connectivity and blue light exposure. “In the digital age, Gen Z faces unique sleep challenges. Constant connectivity, social media pressures, and blue light exposure disrupt natural sleep patterns, leading to chronic deprivation,” he explains. Addressing these sleep issues requires a multifaceted approach, tailored specifically to the needs and habits of Gen Z. In conclusion, tackling the sleep challenges faced by Gen Z requires both practical solutions and a broader cultural shift. By choosing the right mattress, promoting good sleep hygiene, and valuing the importance of rest, this tech-savvy generation can overcome their sleep struggles and enjoy a healthier, more energetic life. As Malani puts it, “Prioritizing comfort and adaptability in a mattress can help Gen Z achieve restful sleep and refreshed mornings.” Similarly, Sundar’s vision of a holistic approach aims to help Gen Z “regain their nights, so they can wake up to a brighter and healthier future with our technologically advanced solutions.” Together, these strategies can pave the way for a well-rested and resilient generation."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Lifestyle Desk News18.com Last Updated: June 16, 2024, 16:24 IST New Delhi, India According to recent data from the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), the most common STDs in India include chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV/AIDS According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), almost 1 million people worldwide contract STDs. In India, around 6% of the adult population is infected with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) every year. According to recent data from the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), the most common STDs in India include chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV/AIDS. Recently, experts have pointed out the increase in sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the country. In addition to this, experts have also stressed the link between this increase in STDs and rising infertility in the country. Understanding STDs and their prevalence in India Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are the source of sexually transmitted illnesses (STDs). They are mostly spread through sexual contact. Viruses, bacteria, or parasites are the causes of STIs. A sexually transmitted infection can spread through bodily fluids such as blood, semen, or the vagina. STDs are a major health concern in the country, with infections like chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and HIV being the most common. According to the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), millions of new STD cases are reported annually in India, highlighting the need to create more awareness around the same. Link Between STDs and Infertility Both male and female reproductive health can be compromised by untreated STDs, leading to infertility. In addition to causing issues with reproduction, STDs can also make it difficult to conceive. If an underlying STD is found and treated early on, this issue can be dealt with. Consequently, the importance of STD screening has increased to preserve reproductive health. STDs such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea are notorious for causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women. PID is a severe infection of the female reproductive organs, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. It can lead to scarring and blockages in the fallopian tubes, preventing the egg from travelling to the uterus for fertilization. STDs can also have a profound impact on male fertility. Infections can lead to epididymitis, an inflammation of the ducts that carry sperm. This can cause blockages or impair sperm quality, leading to reduced fertility. Additionally, STDs can cause inflammation and damage to the prostate and testicles, further affecting sperm production and function. Overall, the inflammatory response triggered by STDs in both women and men can result in structural changes, scarring, and impaired reproductive function, ultimately affecting fertility. Factors contributing to the rise in STDs in India Prevention and treatment Overall, comprehensive sex education is a critical tool for promoting sexual and reproductive health, challenging cultural taboos and stigma, and empowering individuals to make informed choices about their bodies and relationships. By integrating sex education into school curricula and community-based programs, India can work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for sexual health and well-being."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Lifestyle Desk News18.com Last Updated: June 16, 2024, 16:34 IST New Delhi, India With men having higher smoking rates than women, this makes them prone to bladder cancer. Bladder cancer is more prevalent in men than in women. The gender bias is evident in the development of cancer of the bladder in males. Having a family member with bladder cancer also slightly increases your risk. Age is a major risk factor, with bladder cancer being more common in people over the age of 55 years. Another significant contributing factor is smoking, one of the biggest risk factors for bladder cancer. Chemicals from tobacco can accumulate in the urine and damage the lining of the bladder. With men having higher smoking rates than women, this makes them prone to bladder cancer. Other factors that may put men at higher risk of bladder cancer include adhering to a sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating habits. People working in industries are also at higher risk of developing bladder cancer as they are continuously exposed to certain industrial chemicals (which are carcinogenic) commonly used in dye, rubber, leather, textiles, and paint industries. These risk factors are associated with increasing the risk of bladder cancer for both men and women. However, men with their genetic predisposition, with other risk factors associated, are more vulnerable to developing cancer of the bladder than women. In women, it is considered that their hormonal differences protect them from developing this type of cancer. The major symptom is in the form of passing blood in the urine (hematuria), especially blood clots, which may appear bright red or cola-coloured. Some may experience episodes of frequent urination, painful urination, and back pain. The diagnosis of bladder cancer begins with a combination of tests and procedures. Your physician will usually order some investigations in the form of ultrasound, urine tests, and blood tests, which will indicate the cause of the symptoms. They may also ask for imaging tests, cystoscopy, and biopsy to confirm and assess the extent of the cancer in your body. So, if you notice blood in your urine or experience persistent urinary symptoms, consult your doctor immediately for a thorough evaluation. Regular check-ups and prompt attention to symptoms are key for early detection and successful treatment of bladder cancer. While bladder cancer is more common in men, it is important to understand that both men and women can develop the disease. Therefore, everyone should be aware of the risks and symptoms. Quitting smoking is the most important step to take to prevent your risk, followed by making healthy adjustments to your lifestyle habits."

In today’s world, it feels like anxiety and stress are constantly hanging over us, making it hard to find a balance in life. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by these emotions, isn’t it? But amidst all this chaos, have you ever stopped to think about what truly makes you happy? It’s a question that might seem simple, yet many of us struggle to answer it. And even when we do, that feeling of happiness often disappears, overshadowed by the demands of our daily routines. We all are pretty aware that meditation, yoga, and therapy can be helpful tools but did you ever imagine that mastering these practices could turn you into a true connoisseur of happiness? In a recent encounter with ‘His Holiness’ the Dalai Lama, Vivek Raina, Founder and CEO, Excitel Broadband shared “Meeting Dalai Lama was a profound experience that left me contemplating why success, despite all its promises, often brings stress and anxiety instead of happiness? So, when I had the opportunity to meet ‘his Holiness’, I couldn’t resist but ask the age-old question, what is the secret to happiness? In his typically gracious manner, Dalai Lama answered, happiness lies in staying present. It’s a sentiment that resonated deeply with me. As I reflected on this, it struck me how effortlessly children let go of negative emotions, living fully in the moment. Their ability to embrace the now without being weighed down by past grievances or future worries is a lesson we adults could certainly learn from. In our fast-paced world filled with distractions and mounting pressures, embracing the present moment can be a challenge. Yet, it’s in this very moment that true contentment lies” So, if you are somebody who is looking to overcome those feelings of anxiety and stress. Here are some of the concepts that can help: But real wisdom means realizing that our understanding is limited and that people and circumstances are constantly evolving. In essence, becoming truly intelligent means breaking free from the habit of seeing everything through the lens of the past. It’s about embracing the ever-changing nature of life and approaching each moment with openness and compassion So, as we navigate the complexities of modern life, let us remember to pause, breathe, and embrace the present moment with an open heart and mind. For within this moment lies the key to unlocking a life filled with genuine happiness, peace, and fulfilment."

However, amidst the joys of outdoor activities and beach vacations, it’s crucial to prioritize sun safety and skin cancer prevention. Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer globally, but with proactive measures, we can significantly reduce its risk. Understanding Sun Exposure The sun emits ultraviolet (UV) radiation, capable of penetrating the skin and causing cellular damage. Prolonged exposure to UV rays heightens the risk of skin cancer, encompassing melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. It’s paramount to remain vigilant about sun safety practices, particularly during peak sun hours between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when UV radiation peaks. Cause and Symptoms of Skin Cancer Skin cancer develops when unrepaired DNA damage to skin cells triggers mutations or genetic defects that lead to uncontrolled cell growth and the formation of malignant tumors. The most common cause of skin cancer is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or artificial sources like tanning beds. UV radiation damages the DNA in skin cells, increasing the risk of mutations that can lead to cancerous growths. Symptoms of skin cancer can vary depending on the type and stage of the disease. Common signs include changes in the size, shape, or color of existing moles or lesions, the development of new growths, itching, tenderness, or bleeding of skin lesions, and persistent sores that do not heal. It’s important to promptly seek medical attention if you notice any concerning changes in your skin, as early detection and treatment can significantly improve outcomes for individuals with skin cancer. Regular self-examinations and routine skin screenings by a dermatologist are essential for early detection and prevention of skin cancer. Skin Cancer Prevention:"

The affected areas include Dahegam urban area, Kalol, and Moti Shiholi village. Two children from Dahegam were hospitalized on May 28 with diarrhea, and subsequent tests confirmed cholera. Both children are in stable condition and are expected to recover fully. In Kalol, a 70-year-old woman was also hospitalized with suspected cholera. Additionally, a 4-year-old girl in Moti Shiholi village was diagnosed with cholera but has since been discharged. Health officials suspect contaminated drinking water in Dahegam and contaminated food from roadside vendors in Kalol are potential sources of the outbreak. The water supply in the affected area of Dahegam has been temporarily suspended, and drinking water is being provided through tankers. Cholera is a waterborne disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Outbreaks typically occur due to contaminated water sources or inadequate sanitation practices. Several factors can contribute to the current situation in Gujarat: Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and include: Cholera can be fatal if not treated promptly. Residents are advised to seek immediate medical attention if they experience these symptoms. Dr Iyer expressed concern over the outbreak, stating, “We have seen three confirmed cholera cases in the last 10 days, which is alarming. Cholera is a food and waterborne disease, so hand hygiene, consuming clean, cooked food, and safe drinking water are crucial for our health. If anyone develops diarrhea or vomiting, immediate medical help should be sought.” While the outbreak of the cholera in Gandhinagar, Gujarat is the cause of concern, it is important to note that the situation is actively managed. However, by understanding the cause and following preventive measures, we can work together to protect our communities and prevent the further spread of the diseases."

Despite its prevalence, BCC is often less known than other skin cancers like melanoma. BCC originates from the basal cells, which are responsible for producing new skin cells as old ones die off. It typically manifests as a slightly transparent bump on the skin, though it can take other forms. BCC most commonly occurs on areas of the skin that are frequently exposed to the sun, such as the head, neck, and arms. While it grows slowly and rarely metastasizes (spreads to other parts of the body), it can cause significant local damage if left untreated. Why Does Basal Cell Carcinoma Happen? The primary cause of BCC is prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds. UV radiation can damage the DNA in skin cells, leading to abnormal cell growth and the formation of cancerous cells. Several risk factors can increase the likelihood of developing BCC, including: While not all cases of BCC are preventable, reducing UV exposure is the most effective strategy to lower the risk. Preventive measures include: Is Basal Cell Carcinoma Treatable? Yes, BCC is highly treatable, particularly when detected early. Various treatment options are available, depending on the size, depth, and location of the carcinoma. Common treatments include: Basal cell carcinoma, while common and generally less aggressive than other skin cancers, requires attention and appropriate care. Understanding the causes, taking preventive measures, and seeking prompt treatment are essential steps in managing and reducing the impact of BCC. With awareness and proactive skin health practices, the risks associated with basal cell carcinoma can be significantly mitigated."

Menopause is a natural biological process that marks the end of a woman’s menstrual cycles. During this transition, hormonal changes occur, including a decline in estrogen levels. While menopause itself does not directly cause breast cancer, the hormonal fluctuations associated with this stage of life can influence breast cancer risk. Estrogen plays a significant role in breast cancer development, particularly in hormone receptor-positive breast cancers. During menopause, estrogen levels decrease, reducing the stimulation of breast tissue by this hormone. As a result, the risk of developing estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer typically decreases after menopause. However, menopause does not eliminate the risk of breast cancer altogether. Other factors, such as genetics, lifestyle factors, and environmental exposures, continue to play a role in breast cancer risk post-menopause. Additionally, certain changes that occur during menopause, such as weight gain and changes in breast density, may affect breast cancer risk. Furthermore, while the risk of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer may decrease after menopause, the risk of hormone receptor-negative breast cancer, which is not influenced by estrogen levels, remains constant. Therefore, menopause does not offer complete protection against breast cancer. While menopause itself does not cause breast cancer, the aging process and changes associated with menopause can impact breast cancer risk. Therefore, women should continue to prioritize breast health through regular screenings, healthy lifestyle choices, and awareness of any changes in their breasts, regardless of their menopausal status. In conclusion, while menopause does not directly cause breast cancer, the hormonal changes associated with this stage of life can influence breast cancer risk. Understanding these factors and maintaining vigilance with regard to breast health is essential for women as they navigate the menopausal transition and beyond."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Lifestyle Desk News18.com Last Updated: June 19, 2024, 11:40 IST New Delhi, India Early detection and diagnosis are important to improve the outcomes of kidney cancer Kidney cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the kidneys. It is estimated that kidney cancer accounts for around 2% to 3% of all cancers worldwide. The condition usually goes undetected in the early stages due to a lack of symptoms. By the time individuals start to see symptoms like blood in their urine, the cancer has advanced its stage, making it difficult to treat. Early detection can increase the chances of successful treatment and survival. Early detection also leads to the prevention of the spreading of cancer to other parts of the body and enables the use of less aggressive treatments. The cost of treatment also decreases after early diagnosis because less expensive treatments are done. Early detection significantly enhances the prospects of successfully treating kidney issues. Through procedures such as Nephron Sparing Surgeries (also known as partial nephrectomy), it is possible to preserve kidney function by removing only the diseased part of the organ, thereby safeguarding overall renal health. There are many methods through which kidney cancer can be detected, including: Treatment options: Treatment depends on the stage of the cancer, health of the patient, and other factors. Cancer at its early stage can be treated successfully just by the surgery. Some primary surgeries include: • Partial nephrectomy: it is removal of the tumour and preservation of the kidney as much as possible.• Radical nephrectomy: in this entire affected kidney is removed. It is done only when tumour is large or centrally located. In advanced condition, treatments like targeted therapy, radiation therapy or immunotherapy are done. Targeted therapy includes drugs that particularly attack cancer cells, while immunotherapy helps boost boosting of immune system, and radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to shrink tumours or kill cancer cells. Early detection and diagnosis are important to improve the outcomes of kidney cancer. By early detection individuals will go through a less invasive treatment, there will be higher survival rate will increase, and the quality of life will also improve. Routine check-ups, screening tests, and awareness are important to identify the condition. As there are advancements in medical technology, it is important to detect and diagnose the condition early, as it is the cornerstone of fighting against childhood cancer."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Lifestyle Desk News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 06:36 IST New Delhi, India International Yoga Day 2024: Through its ancient wisdom and modern relevance, yoga continues to enrich lives worldwide, fostering a healthier and more balanced approach to living. Yoga, an ancient practice rooted in the philosophy of holistic health, offers a profound pathway to harmonizing the body and mind. As we celebrate Yoga Day, let us embrace yoga not just as a form of exercise but as a transformative journey towards inner harmony and holistic wellness. Through its ancient wisdom and modern relevance, yoga continues to enrich lives worldwide, fostering a healthier and more balanced approach to living. Understanding Yoga’s Eight Limbs Dr Karthiyayini Mahadevan, Head of Wellness and Wellbeing, Columbia Pacific Communities, says, “Yoga’s eight limbs guide us towards physical, mental, and spiritual equilibrium.” In the journey towards holistic health, yoga’s eight limbs provide a structured framework. As Dr. Mahadevan explains, “The Yama and Niyama teach us ethical guidelines, while Asana and Pranayama focus on physical and mental well-being. The higher limbs—Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi—guide us towards self-awareness and spiritual enlightenment.” Yoga in Modern Life In today’s fast-paced world, stress and lifestyle-related illnesses are prevalent challenges. Dr Mahadevan highlights yoga’s relevance: “Yoga isn’t just exercise; it’s a lifestyle that can alleviate stress and prevent psychosomatic diseases.” Integrating yoga into daily routines can significantly enhance longevity and quality of life, irrespective of existing health conditions. Harnessing Yoga’s Benefits On International Yoga Day, the spotlight is on yoga’s transformative benefits for mental and physical well-being. Divya Rolla, Yoga Expert, Cult, underscores yoga’s role in reducing stress and anxiety: “Through practices like meditation and pranayama, yoga activates the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation and reducing cortisol levels.” Asanas for Mental Clarity and Emotional Stability Yoga also fosters emotional resilience and introspection. “Poses that open the heart and expand the chest, like Anahatasana and Ustrasana, help release pent-up emotions and cultivate emotional balance,” notes Rolla. Cognitive Enhancement and Focus The practice of yoga enhances cognitive functions such as memory and concentration. “Postures that demand mental discipline, such as Garudasana and Vrikshasana, sharpen focus and improve overall cognitive abilities,” explains Rolla. Physical Health and Vitality Beyond mental benefits, yoga profoundly impacts physical health. “Asanas like Downward-Facing Dog and Warrior II not only enhance strength and flexibility but also contribute to overall vitality,” Rolla highlights. Promoting Restful Sleep Quality sleep is crucial for mental clarity and physical rejuvenation. “Practices such as restorative yoga and yoga nidra promote deep relaxation, improving sleep quality and overall wellness,” Rolla suggests. Yoga stands as a holistic practice that nurtures the mind-body connection, offering profound benefits for mental health and overall wellbeing. Dr. Mahadevan summarizes, “By integrating yoga into daily life, individuals can achieve a balanced existence—physically fit, emotionally resilient, and mentally clear.”"

We spoke with leading experts in the field of dermatology to understand the causes and effective solutions for these common issues. According to Dr Mrunal Shah Modi, Founder & Director, Shine Skin, Hair & Laser, Mumbai, genetics play a crucial role in male hair loss, “Men with a family history of baldness are predisposed to male pattern baldness, the most common form of hair loss.” She highlights that understanding genetic factors is essential in managing and preventing hair loss. Stress is another significant contributor, explains Dr Modi believes, “Stress disrupts the hair growth cycle, leading to increased shedding and thinning.” This is particularly relevant for men balancing work and family responsibilities, where stress levels can be heightened. Dr Modi also emphasizes lifestyle factors, “Poor diet, smoking, and excessive grooming practices can exacerbate hair loss.” She advises men to prioritize a balanced diet, regular exercise, and gentle hair care routines to maintain healthy hair growth. On the other hand, Dr Rashmi Shetty, Cosmetic Dermatologist, Ra Aesthetics & Dermatology underscores the role of nutrition in combating hair loss, “Essential minerals like iron, magnesium, zinc, and calcium, along with vitamins B12, D, and B complex, are crucial for hair health.” She recommends supplements rich in these nutrients to support hair growth. For men considering in-clinic treatments, Dr Shetty outlines several effective options: Hair loss is a multifaceted issue with genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors at play. Understanding the causes and adopting a comprehensive approach that includes nutritional support, lifestyle modifications, and advanced treatments can significantly improve hair health and restore confidence in men experiencing hair loss. As Dr. Modi and Dr. Shetty advocate, early intervention and personalized care are key to managing and reversing the effects of hair loss effectively. By incorporating these expert insights and treatments into their routines, men can embrace healthier, fuller hair and enhance their overall well-being."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Lifestyle Desk News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 07:54 IST New Delhi, India Power Yoga will awaken your inner warrior, but it's about more than just feeling like a superhero Let’s be honest, sometimes the idea of yoga evokes images of peace bordering on sleepiness. But what if you crave a workout that kick starts your day while simultaneously calming your mind? Well, it’s time to understand Power Yoga, the dynamic practice that’s like a shot of espresso for your body and soul. Rati S Tehri, Yoga Expert takes us through it From Flow to Fire: A Fusion of Fitness and Focus The magic of Power Yoga lies in Vinyasa. No, it’s not a pep talk (though it might leave you feeling similarly energized). It’s a Sanskrit term meaning “to connect in a special way.” In Power Yoga, this translates to a seamless dance between movement and breath. Building a Powerful Body: Strength & Flexibility Sure, power yoga will awaken your inner warrior, but it’s about more than just feeling like a superhero. This practice builds a well-rounded physical foundation. Forget the stereotype of yoga being all about pretzel-like flexibility. Power Yoga imbibes elements of strength training – think planks, lunges, and chaturangas (push-up variations) woven into the flow. These exercises build strength, stability, and endurance, leaving you feeling like you can conquer anything life throws your way. There’s more for people who crave flexibility drills. Power Yoga sequences also include deep stretches and holds, allowing your body to open up and increase its range of motion. This newfound flexibility translates into better posture, a reduced risk of injury, and a sense of freedom in your movements. You’ll be able to reach for that top shelf with ease (and maybe even surprise yourself with a newfound ability to touch your toes!). Finding Your Center: Balance for the Body and Mind Power Yoga isn’t just about forceful movement as much as it is about cultivating balance. Balancing postures like Warrior III and Tree Pose challenge you to find stability amidst the ever changing energy flow. It is more like being a tightrope walker, but instead of a wobbly rope, you’re strengthening your core, improving coordination, and learning to hover through life’s inevitable wobbles with unmatched grace. The benefits extend beyond the physical, too. The mental focus required to maintain challenging postures and synchronize your breath translates into a calmer, more centered mind. You learn to be present in the moment, letting go of distractions and worries that may be swirling around you. This newfound clarity can become your superpower in daily life, helping you approach challenges with a cool head and focused determination. Taking Your First Steps on the Power Yoga Journey Everyone has to start somewhere. You too have to. Thus, Tehri shares a few tips to get you started: So, for now you can just step onto your mat, breathe deeply, and move with intention. Power Yoga is more than just a workout as it’s a journey of self-discovery, a practice that empowers you to see the world with a strong body, a flexible mind, and a heart full of fire."

Playback singer Alka Yagnik recently revealed on Instagram that she has been diagnosed with a rare hearing disorder. “To all my fans, friends, followers, and well-wishers: A few weeks ago, after disembarking from a flight, I suddenly found myself unable to hear anything. It took me some time to gather the courage to speak about it, but I now want to break my silence for all those who have been wondering why I’ve been absent. My doctors have diagnosed me with a rare sensory neural nerve hearing loss caused by a viral attack,” she posted. Yagnik, renowned for her hit Bollywood songs, also shared a message of caution for her followers. “To my fans and young colleagues, I urge you to be mindful of exposure to very loud music and headphones,” she advised. Dr Sanjay Sachdeva, senior ENT consultant, HearClear, says, “The ears are an integral part of the body, enabling smooth communication, and crucial for awareness of the surroundings. Beyond hearing ability, the ear is essential for the functioning of various cognitive processes and assists in performing daily activities seamlessly.” Understanding the significance of healthy ears, Dr Sachdeva shares ways to maintain ear hygiene: Having elaborated on the tips to maintain healthy ear hygiene, it is recommended to visit a doctor on facing difficulty in hearing . Complaints regarding high TV volume, and problems following a conversation of two or more people speaking at the same time, are some of the instances requiring the intervention of doctors. Along with this, few people tend to form excessive wax, causing temporary hearing loss. They should use wax softeners and visit their health providers for wax removal. It is not advisable to do it on their own."

Many individuals, particularly women, often experience body pain during periods of heightened stress. But is there a direct correlation between stress and body pain in women? Let’s delve deeper into this topic. Stress is known to trigger a physiological response in the body, leading to the release of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones can exacerbate muscle tension, leading to stiffness and discomfort. Additionally, stress can also lower the pain threshold, making individuals more susceptible to experiencing pain. In women, stress-induced body pain is commonly reported in areas such as the neck, shoulders, and lower back. These areas are particularly prone to tension and stiffness, which can be further exacerbated by stress. Additionally, stress-related muscle tension can lead to headaches and migraines, further adding to the discomfort. Furthermore, chronic stress can contribute to the development or exacerbation of conditions like fibromyalgia and tension-type headaches, which are characterized by widespread body pain. Women are more likely to experience these conditions, further highlighting the potential link between stress and body pain in women. Moreover, stress can indirectly contribute to body pain by affecting sleep quality. Poor sleep due to stress can lead to increased muscle tension and heightened sensitivity to pain, further perpetuating the cycle of stress and discomfort. While stress is not the sole cause of body pain in women, it certainly plays a significant role. Managing stress through relaxation techniques, regular exercise, and seeking support from friends, family, or mental health professionals can help alleviate stress-related body pain in women. In conclusion, stress can indeed cause body pain in women, primarily by exacerbating muscle tension and lowering the pain threshold. Understanding the connection between stress and body pain is essential for implementing effective stress management strategies and promoting overall well-being."

In a heartfelt social media post, Yagnik revealed that she has been diagnosed with a rare form of sensorineural hearing loss following a viral infection. The Diagnosis Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is a type of hearing impairment caused by damage to the inner ear or the neural pathways that connect the ear to the brain. This condition can be triggered by a viral infection, which may initially present as common ailments such as a cold, cough, or sore throat. Yagnik experienced a sudden and alarming loss of hearing shortly after a viral outbreak, leading to her diagnosis. Who is at Risk? Sensorineural hearing loss can affect anyone, but certain factors may increase the risk: Existing Health Conditions Conditions such as diabetes or autoimmune diseases may increase vulnerability. Early detection of sensorineural hearing loss is crucial for effective treatment. Common symptoms include: Imbalance: Difficulty maintaining balance or a sense of dizziness. The treatment for sensorineural hearing loss often involves the use of steroids to reduce inflammation and promote recovery. The method of steroid administration can vary based on the patient’s condition: A Word from Alka Yagnik Yagnik’s revelation serves as a poignant reminder of the unpredictability of health and the importance of being vigilant about unusual symptoms. She also shared a message of caution for her fans and colleagues: “To my fans and young colleagues, I urge you to be mindful of exposure to very loud music and headphones.” Alka Yagnik’s diagnosis of sensorineural hearing loss highlights the need for awareness and timely medical intervention in addressing hearing issues.

    "article_content": "Published By : Shreeja Bhattacharya Trending Desk Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 07:00 IST New Delhi, India Patients might experience some discomfort post-surgery, like mild pain, swelling, and discomfort in the donor and recipient areas. (Image: Shutterstock) Advancements in technology have undoubtedly transformed the world around us. In the beauty industry, too, gone are the days of large, linear scar-forming hair transplant procedures. Modern techniques have made it a more viable and attractive option for individuals experiencing hair loss. With time, hair transplant procedures have gained popularity in India due to increased awareness and demand among both men and women. However, these beauty enhancements often come at a steep price that can prick a hole in your pocket. As per a report by India Today, the cost of a hair transplant varies based on factors such as the clinic, the number of grafts needed, and the surgeon’s expertise. In Turkey, the average cost ranges from $1,500 to $3,500 (approximately Rs 1,24,000 to Rs 2,90,000), while the cost in India is also competitive, ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 (approximately Rs 83,000 to Rs 2,50,000) depending on similar factors. Procedure The hair transplant procedure involves moving hair follicles from a part of the body with dense hair, known as the donor area, to a bald or thinning, called the recipient area. There are two main methods of hair transplant: Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) and Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT). The procedure starts with local anaesthesia, followed by the extraction of hair, preparation of the recipient part, and implantation of the hair follicles. The transplanted hair typically falls out after a few weeks but starts regrowing fully in about a year. Follicular Unit Transplantation involves removing a strip of scalp from the donor area, dissecting individual follicular units, and implanting them into the recipient area. In Follicular Unit Extraction, individual follicles are extracted using a micro-punch directly from the donor area and then transplanted. Aftercare Patients might experience some discomfort post-surgery, like mild pain, swelling, and discomfort in the donor and recipient areas, which can be lowered with prescribed pain medications and proper aftercare. While hair transplants are generally safe, there are some risks, including infection, unnatural-looking hair growth, scarring, and folliculitis, to keep in mind. Hence, surgeons instruct patients to keep the scalp clean, avoid direct sunlight, and avoid strenuous activities for a few weeks. It is also important to wash the hair as per the surgeon’s instructions and take the prescribed medication to prevent infection and reduce swelling. Alternatives Many people may be curious to know if this hair loss therapy hurts or not. Generally, the procedure lasts between 4 and 8 hours, depending on the person. Patients do not feel pain during the surgery, as the procedure is performed under local anaesthesia. If you do not want to go through a hair transplant treatment, you can also opt for non-surgical options like medication (minoxidil and finasteride) to slow hair loss and stimulate hair growth. Other alternatives are low-level laser therapy (LLLT), which uses light to promote hair growth, and scalp micro-pigmentation, which involves tattooing tiny dots on the scalp to create the illusion of fuller hair. In addition to that, hairpieces, wigs, and hair extensions can also be a temporary solution to the hair loss problem. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy is another effective treatment where a person’s blood is used to promote hair growth. However, it is important to know that each alternative has its benefits and limitations, and its effectiveness varies from person to person."

(Images: Instagram) It is International Day of Yoga, and Malaika Arora has once again shared an inspiring fitness video. This time, focusing on those dealing with lower back pain. To help alleviate discomfort, the actress recommended the cat and cow yoga pose (also known as Hatha Yoga) for optimal relief and flexibility. Using her Instagram platform, Malaika guided her followers through a detailed, step-by-step demonstration of performing the asana. In her caption, she wrote, “Flowing into happiness …one pose at a time…” The video starts with Malaika Arora in a cat position, placing her hands shoulder-width apart and aligning her knees below her hips. Inhaling deeply, she shifts into the cat pose, arching her back upward. With a smooth exhale, she transitions into the cow pose, lowering her belly and lifting her head and tailbone. Malaika continues this coordinated movement with each breath cycle, emphasising the stretch along the entire spine. She encourages viewers to maintain the rhythmic breathing pattern throughout the sequence. After completing the final exhale, she advises returning to a neutral spine position. A post shared by Malaika Arora (@malaikaaroraofficial) The Cat-Cow pose is highly beneficial as it enhances flexibility in the spine, shoulders and neck. This pose also effectively stretches muscles in the back, abdomen, chest, and hips, promoting overall mobility and relieving tension in these areas. This isn’t the first time Malaika has given us a glimpse of her workout routine. Previously, the diva shared a video showing Danda Yoga to improve her physical strength and flexibility. Using a bamboo stick, she performed various poses targeting muscles throughout her entire body. A post shared by Malaika Arora (@malaikaaroraofficial) In this video, Malaika can be seen working on her core muscles by performing a series of yoga poses. Using two blocks, she focused on every muscle from head to toe. She started with Mountain Pose (Parvatasana), followed by stretching. Then, she transitioned to Vasisthasana, a side-bend plank pose to enhance her balance and strength. Next, she performed single-leg push-ups to target her upper body. Afterwards, she returned to Mountain Pose to focus on her spine. Additionally, she included standing crunches, glute bridges, and Warrior 2 poses in her routine. A post shared by Vanshika Pandey (@beingvanshika_) On International Yoga Day 2024, the actress took to Instagram to share a “Gratitude Post.” Check it out- A post shared by Malaika Arora (@malaikaaroraofficial) Malaika is a true blue fitness icon who simply keeps getting better with each day that passes by."

While we are mostly aware of its impact on our body, what needs to be addressed is how the scorching summer affects menstrual health and cycle. Can heatwaves affect menstruation? This is the question that probably has not crossed your mind, right? Well, seasonal shifts, especially heat, disrupt the hormonal balance responsible for a woman’s period, further affecting the changes in flow, duration, and even the intensity of cramps and other symptoms. Dehydration has a direct impact on menstrual flow and cycle regularity, potentially leading to lighter periods or spotting. This can be attributed to the impact of inadequate hydration on the body’s ability to eliminate waste and toxins as it affects hormonal balance. Let’s take a look at other ways in which a surge in temperature can impact periods. Now, let’s move on to the steps that you can adopt to regulate your periods in the summer. These steps include keeping yourself hydrated and practising regular hygiene. Stay away from caffeine and other junk food and ensure that you are having a balanced diet."

I know that he puts his heart, mind and soul into whatever he does. And I think he understands the responsibility of being the leader of the opposition. As the leader of the opposition, he will challenge the BJP on every plan that they have.” On PM’s remark on the Emergency, AAP MP Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer said, “For us ‘black day’ is today. Today MPs elected from across the country are coming here and today itself the Constitution is being shredded by the PM and his colleagues. The past 10 years were black days for us as dictatorship and murder of democracy are taking place across the country. Opposition leaders are being put behind bars.” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah of attacking the Constitution and said it was not acceptable to them.

He has shown no evidence that he understands the true meaning of the people’s verdict, which saw him eking out only a narrow and dubious win in Varanasi. Let him be under no doubt: the INDIA Janbandhan will hold him to account for every minute. He stands brutally exposed,” he said.

They superseded a Dalit MP who was an 8-term MP.” “K Suresh should have been the pro-tem speaker. Unfortunately, the Parliamentary Affairs Minister has taken such a decision without any consultation with the opposition parties,” he added. In a show of unity, Opposition INDIA bloc MPs will assemble in the Parliament complex and enter the Lok Sabha together on the first day of the session.

Legendary Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan apologised to Prabhas’ fans ahead of Kalki 2898 AD’s release. The superstar, seated with Prabhas for a chat about the film, offered to apologise in advance for his character is set to have an epic clash with the Telugu superstar in the film. For the unversed, Amitabh plays the role of Ashwatthama who will lock horns with Prabhas’ Bhairava. In a new video released by Vyjayanthi Network, Kalki 2898 AD producers Priyanka Dutt and Swapna Dutt, along with Prabhas, Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukone and Kamal Haasan opened up about the Nag Ashwin directorial. Big B recalled the first time the director approached him for the role in the film and in the process, apologised to Prabhas’ fans. “When Nagi came to talk to me about this, he just brought a picture, a visual of what my character is going to look like and what Prabhas is going to look like. And I was this huge guy who’s shoving off ‘THE’ Prabhas. And al the fans of Prabhas, please, you know, please excuse me. Main haath jod ke maafi maang rahe hai, don’t massacre me after you see what I do,” Amitabh said. Prabhas jumped in to assure him that his fans love him too. “They are all your fans too,” he said.

Very rarely do you see that.'” At a recent press conference held in Mumbai, Amitabh confessed he was taken aback with the concept of Kalki 2898 AD. “When Nag Ashwin came and explained his idea to me, for the long time after he left I was thinking, ‘what the hell is Nagi drinking?’” Amitabh said, leaving Rana and his other co-stars in splits. Amitabh continued, “To see something like this which is absolutely outrageous, some of the visuals that you have seen are unbelievable. To have somebody conceive a project which is so futuristic and possible… and during the making of the film you realise that no matter what he thought of he actually brought all the material, all the effects, every kind of vision that he had to the screen and that’s been really amazing. For me to be just a part of it, has been an experience I’ll never forget.” Kalki 2898 AD is set to release on June 27, 2024."

The committee is slated to submit its report within two months on the smooth and fair conduct of exams through the National Testing Agency (NTA). The new agency DG too hold a meeting today. The CBI has taken over the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) 2024 paper leak case on the reference of the Education Ministry. It has also taken over the probe from the Gujarat and Bihar governments. A total of five people were arrested on Sunday in Bihar’s Nalanda while NTA has debarred 17 more students for alleged use of “malpractices” in the medical entrance exam taking the total to 110. Meanwhile, on June 23, NTA conducted the re-exam of NEET UG for a total of 1,563 candidates. 750 were absent. The results will be announced on June 30. Stay ahead with all the exam results updates on News18 Website . According to NTA, at the Girl’s Higher Secondary Model School in Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan, a mix-up occurred where the Centre Superintendent mistakenly distributed Hindi medium question papers to English medium candidates and vice versa on the NEET UG May 5th exam. This error led to agitation among some candidates, who left the centre with the question papers despite staff efforts to stop them. These papers were circulated on social media around 4:25 PM, creating a false impression of a leak. However, all centres were under CCTV surveillance, preventing external access once the exam began. The affected candidates retook the exam with the correct papers on the same day. VIDEO |”Today, youth are unemployed, there’s high inflation, and no means of earning in rural areas.

The Congress has alleged that there has been no action against the chairman of the National Testing Agency (NTA) P K Joshi, who is “holding interviews” for the appointment of VCs and Directors of premier educational institutes across the country, reported PTI. “Should NTA/PK Joshi be allowed to be part of any such selection exercise during the ongoing inquiry on the multiple paper leak episodes?” Khera asked. In paper leak cases, the roles of many people are under suspicion. They are called suspects. When the investigation begins, they are the first ones to be questioned. During the investigation of the paper leak case in many states, the role of several people is suspicious including employees of the printing press where the paper (which was leaked) was printed, coaching centres that grow their business by showing great results, education consultants who are in contact with the students, etc. The big question is how does any paper get leaked. You must have often heard that before the exam, the paper is kept under very tight security. Papers till the board exam are stored in a room with CCTV and locks. The printing presses around the examination center are closed but still the papers get leaked. How does that happen? 1- Most of the papers are leaked from the printing press. This is where most people come in contact with the papers. The needle of suspicion first turns towards the people working here. 2- Bank locker (or wherever papers are kept) because here also there is third party involvement. 3- Strong room of the commission conducting the examination. 4- Examination Centre. 5- Controller of Examinations. Over 13 lakh candidates out of around 25 lakh qualified for the NEET-UG this year. The top one lakh candidates are spread across 4,500 centres all over the country. As per stats, nearly two-thirds of the qualified students are from rural or semi-rural areas. They will compete for around 1.8 lakh MBBS/dental seats. The re-test results are expected to be released on June 30 and the counselling will begin on July 6. A CBI team from Delhi reached the office of the Economic Offences Unit (EOU) in Patna on Monday morning in connection with the NEET UG paper leak case. The EOU, which had been investigating the matter until the Centre ordered a probe by the CBI, has arrested 18 people in connection with the case, officials told PTI. Bihar and Gujarat governments issued notifications on Sunday to transfer cases of NEET-UG paper leaks registered by their police to the CBI, paving the way for the central agency to take over the probe. Students from across the country were left dismayed when NEET PG 2024 was unexpectedly cancelled just 12 hours before its commencement.

The seven-member panel includes former AIIMS-Delhi director Randeep Guleria, University of Hyderabad Vice-Chancellor BJ Rao, professor emeritus in IIT-Madras’ Department of Civil Engineering K Ramamurthy, People Strong co-founder and Karmayogi Bharat board member Pankaj Bansal, IIT-Delhi Dean of Student Affairs Aditya Mittal and Education Ministry Joint Secretary Govind Jaiswal. The panel is led by former ISRO chief K Radhakrishnan. What is the committee meeting all about? The panel will make recommendations on reforms in the mechanism of the NTA exam process, improvement in data security protocols, and the structure and functioning of the NTA. “The committee is slated to submit its report within two months. The reforms that recommended will be implemented by the next exam cycle. The panel will also look into the exam calendar and make suggestions,” a source told PTI. “A DA case may be registered against arrested accused Sikander Prasad Yadvendu, a junior engineer in Danapur Town Council, as he reportedly acquired huge assets that are disproportionate to his known source of income,” an officer told PTI. A native of Samastipur, Yadvendu “has a history of involvement in criminal activities. Before becoming a junior engineer in 2012, he worked as a contractor in Ranchi. He was previously implicated in an LED scam worth Rs 3 crore. He has served a jail sentence for his role in that case,” the officer said. Insiders and former officials say the National Testing Agency lacks a robust mechanism to handle large examinations like NEET-UG wherein more than 20 lakh students sit for an exam in a single day. Shifting online exams like UGC-NET to the pen-and-paper mode was another mistake, they add… read more A CBI team is expected to visit Patna today, June 24, and is likely to take those arrested in the NEET-UG paper leak case to Delhi for questioning, officials told PTI. The Bihar police’s Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of the Bihar Police has arrested 18 people in connection with the case so far. The CBI team is also expected to collect all evidence from EOU. “All those arrested are in judicial custody in Patna, and the CBI team may take them to Delhi for detailed interrogation by obtaining transit remand from a court here,” an official said. The CBI may also file multiple FIRs in connection with the NEET UG paper leak case. NTA debarred 63 students in Bihar for using malpractices in the exam. It debarred 30 students from Gujarat’s Godhara and 17 from Bihar. “Based on the inputs received, 17 candidates who appeared from centres in Bihar were debarred. This takes the number of total candidates debarred from the exam this year to 110,” an NTA official told PTI. The CBI had filed an FIR in the NEET-UG case on Sunday under section 20-B (criminal conspiracy) and section 420 (cheating). Furthermore, the Bihar and Gujarat governments also issued notifications on Sunday to transfer the probe to the CBI. Last month, Bihar Police’s Economic Offences Unit arrested 13 people, and five more people were held on Sunday. A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking an investigation by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) into the alleged irregularities in the NEET-UG 2024, reported Live Law. “The Enforcement Directorate is duty bound to take cognizance of the matter, investigate, and secure punishment,” the applicants said as per the report. The petition has been listed for hearing on July 8. “The BJP government has ruined the future of the youth. The education and examination system has been completely ruined and handed over to the copying mafia,” Akhilesh Yadav said in a statement issued by the Samajwadi Party, reported PTI. Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Choudhary said an inquiry is underway on various aspects of the alleged paper leak in the NEET UG. “An inquiry is underway. Who are the people involved in this? How did they commit irregularities? All will be jailed after filing FIR,” Choudhary said. The nationwide probe into the alleged irregularities in the medical entrance exam NEET-UG has gained momentum with the CBI filing an FIR and dispatching teams to states and the Bihar Police arrested five persons in a paper leak case, taking the total arrests to 18… read more TAGS"

The bail order was earlier granted by the trial court in the money laundering case pertaining to the liquor policy scam. On Thursday, Delhi’s Rouse Avenue court had granted bail to Arvind Kejriwal on a bail bond of Rs 1 Lakh, which was to be furnished before the duty judge the next day. The stay order came after the ED sought a stay on the order and asked the court to give 48 hours to sign the bail bond so that the order could be challenged in the higher court. The Delhi HC had also issued notice to Kejriwal seeking his response to the Enforcement Directorate’s plea challenging the trial court’s June 20 order by which he was granted bail. The court had further said it was reserving the order for 2-3 days to review the entire record. The bench headed by Justice Misra, while hearing the bail plea today said, “In stay applications, orders are not reserved. They are passed on spot. It is a bit unusual. Anyway, we will have it day after tomorrow.” The Supreme Court adjourned Arvind Kejriwal’s petition and said that it will hear the matter day after tomorrow. The apex court also said that if the HC’s order is passed in the meantime, then it can be brought on record. While hearing the matter on Arvind Kejriwal’s bail plea at the apex court, the bench said, “If we pass an order now, we will be prejudging the issue.” Senior advocate Chaudhari representing Arvind Kejriwal referred to the SC observation in May 10 order that legality of arrest is under consideration and that a liberal view has to be taken regarding interim bail. He also referred to the May 17 order of SC reserving judgment on Kejriwal’s challenge to arrest, highlighting that in that order, SC had allowed him liberty to apply for bail. The Supreme Court has now begun it’s hearing on Arvind Kejriwal’s bail plea in connection to the liquor policy case. Arvind Kejriwal matter is listed as item 44, the bench is currently hearing item 40. A vacation bench of Supreme Court headed by Justice Manoj Mishra will hear Arvind Kejriwal’s bail plea on Monday. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday moved the Supreme Court challenging the Delhi High Court’s stay on the operation of his bail The ED representative, while explaining the operation of Hawala channels at the Delhi Hight court, claimed that Vinod Chauhan and Kejriwal knew each other well and Chauhan is the person who circulated the crores of money through hawala channels. Senior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi representing Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, opposed the stay on bail order at the Delhi High Court on Friday and said the decision is a complete misunderstanding of the trial court. He had also said that a stay in a case like this is equal to cancellation of bail. Acting on the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) plea, the Delhi High Court on Friday stayed the bail granted by the trial court to Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal in the alleged money laundering case in the liquor policy scam. The now-paused order was passed by Rouse Avenue Court’s Special Judge Niyay Bindu on Thursday. Special Judge Niyay Bindu has served as a senior civil judge in the Rohini court, Delhi North West district. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) challenged the trial court’s order on the ground that the court had failed to apply the “twin test” for granting bail under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Offences under the stringent PMLA are cognisable and non-bailable. The Section 45 of the PMLA deals with the ‘twin conditions’ of bail. The first condition is that the person has to prove in court that he or she prima facie is innocent of the offence. Secondly, the accused should be able to convince the judge he would not commit any offence while on bail. On Thursday, Delhi’s Rouse Avenue court had granted bail to Arvind Kejriwal on a bail bond of Rs 1 Lakh, which was to be furnished before the duty judge the next day. The Delhi High Court on Friday had granted an interim stay on the trial court’s bail order to AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal in the money laundering case regarding the alleged liquor policy scam. Arvind Kejriwal’s lawyers have reportedly requested the Supreme Court to take up urgent hearing of the matter on Monday. TAGS"

Warner is set to retire from international cricket once Australia’s campaign in the ongoing T20 World Cup concludes, which Khawaja loves to believe will only be after winning the coveted final. “As a friend, I’d love to see him (Warner) finish on a high. He’s been playing some really good cricket. It’s been really nice to see. You can tell he’s just enjoying being out there. He’s playing pretty relaxed. So he should. Yeah, it would be good to see,” Khawaja told PTI Videos in an interview ahead of Australia’s last Super 8s match against India. The veteran Australia opener is confident that a shock defeat against Afghanistan won’t stand in the way of Mitchell Marsh’s team winning the T20 World Cup for the second time since 2021. Even if Australia lose to India in their last Super 8s match in Gros Islet on Monday evening (India time), Afghanistan will then have to meet improbable equations in order to beat them in net run-rate. IND vs AUS Live Weather Update, St Lucia, T20 World Cup: India vs Australia Super 8 Match Could be a Washout? “If Australia beats India and makes it to the semi-final, I think definitely, I think they can win. I think we’ve just got to get to the semi-final,” Khawaja said. He spoke about Australia’s ability to lift their game at the knock-out stages. “I think we’ve shown over the years that we’re a great knockout team. As soon as there’s a knockout situation, more times than not we’ve won, but we’ve just got to get there.” Khawaja praised Marsh for his leadership skills and his captaincy is a reflection of the kind of person he is. “I think his captaincy is just him. It’s him as a person. He doesn’t try to be anything that he’s not. He’s relaxed. He goes out and plays the game, takes the game on, leads from the front, leads by his actions. So, I’ve really enjoyed watching his captaincy,” he said. The 37-year-old Pakistan born batter, who has played 73 Tests for the ‘Baggy Greens’, also said that no team is invincible but acknowledged that India will be tough to get past. “I mean, India’s always a threat. They have batters left, right and centre. They have great bowlers. They have excellent spinners. They have literally all bases covered. They always have. I wouldn’t go out and say India’s so far ahead, a better team than everyone else, because they’re not. “So I think on any day, any team can beat anyone, particularly in T20 cricket,” he observed. ALSO READ | Usman Khawaja Reflects on Afghanistan’s Victory Over Australia: ‘That’s The Beauty of T20 Cricket’ On Australia’s forthcoming series against India and the home Ashes in 2025, Khawaja termed both as pinnacle of cricketing contests. “It’s always tough to beat India in India. But in the last couple of series, India has beaten Australia in Australia, which is never nice for an Australian. So, yeah, we’ve got a lot to play for. It’s a big series.

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk Edited By: Shilpy Bisht News18.com Last Updated: June 13, 2024, 09:47 IST New Delhi, India According to Arab Times, most of the Indians injured were aged between 20 and 50 years, who worked in a private company. (Image: AFP) A massive fire that engulfed an apartment building in Kuwait City killed at least 49 people, including 40 Indians. The incident took place in a migrant workers’ colony in the Mangaf area in south of Kuwait City on June 12 morning. Around 200 workers were living in the six-storey building where the fire incident took place, according to local media reports. Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said Minister of State Kirti Vardhan Singh will be leaving for Kuwait on the direction of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to oversee assistance to Indians injured in the fire and to ensure early repatriation of mortal remains of those who died. According to MEA, over 50 people suffered injuries but most of them are stable. Arab Times reported that most of the Indians injured were aged between 20 and 50 years, who worked in a private company. Over 195 people live in the building, with most workers from Kerala, Tamil Nadu and North India, as per the Arab Times. Kuwait has a population of nearly 42 lakh, of which 21% (10 lakh) are Indians, who comprise 30% of its workforce. According to the latest statistics released by the Public Authority for Civil Information (PACI) of Kuwait, the population of Kuwait was 4.859 million (1.546 million citizens and 3.3 million expatriates) as of December 2023. Of this, labourers and workers comprised 61% of the total population (almost three million) and 75% of the country’s total expat population. The Indian community remains the largest expatriate community in Kuwait and has already crossed the one million mark. Most Indian professionals work as engineers, doctors, chartered accountants, scientists, software experts, management consultants, architects; technicians and nurses; retail traders and businessmen, though a large proportion consists of unskilled and semi-skilled workers, according to the Indian embassy in Kuwait. According to International Labour Organisation regulations, the minimum referral wages (MRW) have been arrived at for Indian labourers engaged abroad. For Kuwait, the Indian government, in conjunction with states where they travel from (mostly Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab), fixed that in the range of $300-1,050 in 2016 across 64 categories of work. For instance, in Kuwait, carpenters, masons, drivers and pipefitters come in the minimal category of $300 a month, while heavy vehicle drivers and domestic workers fare slightly better. In March, a man from Kerala was killed in an anti-tank missile attack by Lebanon near north Israel border. The deceased, 31-year-old Pat Nibin Maxwell, had reportedly arrived in Israel from Kollam in Kerala two months ago, and was working on a farm at the time of the attack. The other two injured Indians were identified as Bush Joseph George and Paul Melvin. The Centre had then advised around 18,000 Indians living in Israel to move to safer locations within the country amidst the war. “In view of the prevailing security situation and local safety advisories, all Indians nationals in Israel, especially those working in or visiting border areas in the north and south, are advised to relocate to safe areas within Israel. The Embassy remains in touch with the Israeli authorities to ensure the safety of all our nationals,” the Indian Embassy in Israel said in a post on X. In an RTI reply, the External Affairs Ministry last year said of the 1.34 crore NRIs, around 66% are in the Gulf countries, including UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain. While 34.1 lakh NRIs live in the UAE, 25.9 lakh live in Saudi Arabia, followed by 10.2 lakh in Kuwait, 7.4 lakh in Qatar, 7.7 lakh in Oman, 3.2 lakh in Bahrain and 18,000 in Israel. India received close to $123 billion in remittances in 2023, in which, UAE was the second largest source after the US. According to a report by the World Bank, the main factors for the increase in remittance inflow in India are the strong labour markets and the declining inflation in the high-income source countries of the West and Middle East. Furthermore, the report projects an 8 percent increase in India’s remittance inflow in the coming year. Saudi Arabia was in the top position among Gulf countries that offered the most number of jobs in 2022. It is second to the UAE in the number of Indian expats living in a Middle Eastern country. In 2022, Saudi Arabia provided 178,630 jobs to Indians. There was a five-fold increase in the figure as in 2021 and 2020 the numbers were 32,845 and 44,316 respectively. Kuwait was second, which saw a seven-fold increase in the number of jobs, in 2022, and Bahrain was at the last place with just 10,232 jobs offered. An approximate 13,944 Indians trained at Skill India International Centres (SIIC) secured jobs in Saudi Arabia, minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar had informed Parliament last December, the Business Standard reported. Qatar came second with 3,646 skilled employed Indians. According to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), nearly 50% of India’s migrant population works in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries. An estimated 70% of the Indian population in this region comprises semi-skilled and unskilled workers while 20 to 23% of Indian professionals are in ‘white-collar’ jobs such as doctors, engineers, architects, chartered accountants, bankers and more. After the attack on Gaza last October, work licences of more than 100,000 Palestinian workers were suspended by the Israeli government. Thus, Israel had allowed 42,000 Indian construction workers to migrate for work. The agreement was signed between Israeli foreign minister Eli Cohen and external affairs minister S Jaishankar. The Haryana government in December advertised 10,000 positions for construction workers in Israel, including 3,000 posts for carpenters and ironworkers, 2,000 for floor tile fitters, and 2,000 for plasterers. The advertisement said the salary would be around 6,100 shekels (around $1,625) a month. Uttar Pradesh also released a similar advertisement for another 10,000 workers, for which, recruitment drive began in Lucknow, But there have been instances where Indian workers were caught in the conflicts of Middle East. In March 2018, India admitted that 39 Indian workers were killed after they were kidnapped by the ISIS armed group in Iraq. A group of 46 Indian nurses were freed in July 2014 by ISIL after more than a week in captivity. Times of Israel in August, 2023, quoting OECD, reported that the cost of living in Israel is more expensive than 76% of countries in the world. Some basic items such as milk, bread, and cheese are 58% to 70% more expensive in Israel compared to OECD countries. The rent of a one-room apartment in Israel varies from $650-$750 to $450-650 depending on the area. The apartments are not equipped with central heating. One Israeli Shekel is equal to Rs 23.09. Expats who live in Tel Aviv Centre pay dearly for their accommodation, even the inter-city taxis are expensive, according to reports. The job of a caregiver is considered an attractive opportunity for many Indians that offers a take-home salary of Rs 1.25 lakh a month, as reported by The Indian Express . The job offers overtime money to many employees, and the caregivers are entitled to leave on Sabbath from Friday afternoon to Saturday afternoon. The caregiver visa is issued for four years and three months, and can be renewed. Once the visa is expired, the person has to leave the country, with a one-time amount that is offered to them. A person who has completed an ANM (Auxiliary Nursing and Midwife) or GNM (General Nursing and Midwifery) can apply for the job of a caregiver. The caregivers are required to complete a one-month course in Hebrew. English-proficiency tests are not need for this job. The migrants have been applying for job since mid-1990s when the Israeli government enacted a law in 1986 under which aged and disabled were entitled to receive home care, as reported by The Indian Express ."

    "article_content": "Written By : Chirag Sehgal Edited By: Dishya Sharma News18.com Last Updated: May 10, 2024, 14:09 IST Mumbai, India I was a little skeptical when I sat down to watch Undekhi Season 3 to review, simply because I had not watched the previous two seasons. But when I binged the first two seasons to nosedive into the third, I regretted not watching them earlier. Directed by Ashish R. Shukla and produced by Applause Entertainment, Undekhi is a crime drama that revolves around Rinku Atwal (played by Surya Sharma) and his father (Harsh Chhaya). Involved in an illegal drug business, Atwal aka ‘Papa Ji’ lands in trouble after a video of him attempting to take his life surfaces. In an attempt to save his ‘Papa Ji’ from being imprisoned and their drug business, Rinku discovers some hidden dark secrets. To begin with, the show will remind you of Ranbir Kapoor’s starrer Animal. In the Sandeep Reddy Vanga directorial, Ranbir is obsessed with his father, who is always trying to protect him. Rinku is no different. Like the repeated use of ‘Papa’ in Animal, there is repeated use of ‘Papa Ji’ in Undekhi season 3. In fact, in one of the scenes just before the climax, Rinku enters his business rival Malhotra’s house with a rifle and attacks everyone. He turns a one-man army and kills everyone. The scene brings back memories of Ranbir’s insane fight scene set against the backdrop of ‘Arjan Vailly’ in Animal. What works wonders for Undekhi season 3 is its cast. Every actor shines in their respective roles. Surya Sharma carries the show on his shoulders. He brilliantly presents several layers of his character throughout the season. In most parts of the show, we see him maintaining an intense personality. However, when he is supposed to be emotional, he does that also in an impressive way. In several scenes he lets his eyes and silence do all the talking. Harsh Chhaya essays the role of ‘Papa Ji’, an old drunk man with a criminal record. Despite his character’s grey past, Harsh’s performance makes you fall for the character. In comparison with his past projects, Undekhi is an extremely difficult project for Harsh. Yet, he aces it remarkably well. Ankur Rathee plays the role of Papa Ji’s son – Daman Atwal who does not like the world of crime and wants to escape from here. However, he ends up being trapped in his father’s world. Dibyendu Bhattacharya returns to Undekhi 3 as DSP Ghosh. He fears no one and has only one motive – to uncover Papa Ji’s truth and put him behind bars. Dibyendu makes this otherwise intense show fun and lightens its atmosphere. He is fun to watch. Anchal Singh as Teji Atwal looks a little dull but it is primarily because other actors in the show are good enough to overpower her. Varun Badola and Nandish Singh Sandhu get very little screen time. SPOILER ALERT! Nandish finally dies after two seasons. On the other hand, Varun’s story is presented in haste. He isn’t given enough time and opportunity to either present his acting skills or show layers of his character. Even if you haven’t watched the previous two seasons of Undekhi, there is nothing to worry about. You will still understand the third season and that’s the beauty of it. Undekhi 3 is gripping and intriguing. It does not let you blink your eye and makes you wonder what is going to happen next. The show is violent, there is bloodshed. However, it is not gory as compared to other shows in this genre. This makes the crime drama a comfortable watch for all. However, the second half of the show looks a little dragged. The climax of the show is also very weak. It disappoints you and gives you no goosebumps. The climax uncovers Papa Ji’s history in haste and brings nothing new to the audience. It is predictable and similar to what we have been watching for years in almost every other television show. The fault of this terrible climax lies with weak writing."

Anil Kumar, a BSNL employee, welcomed his daughter Urvi, 36, an engineer at Palam Airport in New Delhi, with a lively band and music, emphasising a fresh start and a proud return home. “We brought her back just like we had sent her off after her wedding. We want her to begin afresh with her chin up” remarked Anil Kumar. Urvi had married a computer engineer in 2016 and lived in Delhi, where they had a daughter. However, allegations arose that Urvi’s in-laws were mistreating her for dowry, leading her to seek a divorce, which was granted by the court on February 28. “I tried hard to save the relationship after enduring eight years of torture, beatings, and taunts, but in the end, it broke down.” Also Read: Desi Woman Celebrates Divorce With Viral Photoshoot: ’99 Problems But Husband Ain’t One’ Moved by his daughter’s plight and inspired by the desire to change societal perceptions, Anil organised a jubilant homecoming for Urvi, complete with music and festivities. “While bringing her back home, I made arrangements for ‘band baaja’ so that a positive message would be sent to the society and people would try and understand their daughters rather than ignore them after marriage,” he highlighted. The heartwarming scene, captured on video and widely shared on social media, depicts Urvi participating in customary rituals before the lively beats of dhols fill the neighbourhood. कानपुर : तलाक होने पर बेटी को धूमधाम से वापस लाया पिता➡बेटी को लाने ढोल-बाजे के साथ ससुराल पहुंचा पिता➡उर्वी की शादी चकेरी के आशीष के साथ हुई थी➡उर्वी दिल्ली एयरपोर्ट पर कार्यरत है, उनकी एक 5 साल बेटी है➡8 साल बाद हुआ तलाक तो पिता लाया वापस➡लेकिन दहेज लोभी ससुरालियों… pic.twitter.com/VSP6Dyst4C — भारत समाचार | Bharat Samachar (@bstvlive) April 29, 2024 Reflecting on the occasion, Urvi’s mother, Kusumlata, expressed, “I look forward to being with my daughter and granddaughter.

(Representative Image: Unsplash) A drone attack damaged a merchant ship in the Red Sea near Yemen early Sunday morning, though no injuries were reported, according to a British maritime security agency. Vessels in and around the Red Sea, which is vital to world trade, have come under repeated attack for months by Iran-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen. The rebels say they are acting in support of Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The attack occurred about 65 nautical miles (120 kilometres) west of the Yemeni port city of Hodeida, said the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO), which is run by the Britain’s Royal Navy. “The Master of a merchant vessel reports being hit by uncrewed aerial system (UAS), resulting in damage to the vessel. All crew members are reported safe, and the vessel is proceeding to its next port of call,” said a bulletin from the agency. “Authorities are investigating,” it added. Later on Sunday, UKMTO said it received a distress call from a second vessel, this one off Yemen’s southeastern coast, that had “suffered flooding that cannot be contained”, without specifying what caused the incident. “This has forced the master and crew to abandon the ship. They have been recovered by an assisting ship,” UKMTO said in an incident report, adding that the flooded vessel “remains adrift”. On Saturday, United States Central Command, which has carried out retaliatory strikes against Huthi targets over their attacks on shipping, said it had destroyed three nautical drones belonging to the group over the previous 24 hours. “It was determined these systems presented an imminent threat to US, coalition forces, and merchant vessels in the region,” Central Command said. It also said the rebels had launched three anti-ship missiles into the Gulf of Aden, but no injuries or significant damage were reported."

    "article_content": "Published By : Ritayan Basu AFP Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 08:51 IST Dortmund EURO 2024: Portugal's Pepe (AP) Portugal veteran Pepe is the oldest player ever to appear at the European Championship but that did not stop him being one of the best performers in Saturday’s win over Turkey as coach Roberto Martinez described the 41-year-old as a “wonderful example”. The Porto centre-back, who turned 41 in February, set the record for the competition’s oldest player when he appeared in his country’s 2-1 win over the Czech Republic in their opening game at Euro 2024. He passed the mark set by Hungary goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly, who was 40 years and 86 days when he played against Belgium in the last 16 at Euro 2016, and Pepe was again in the side for Saturday’s 3-0 win over Turkey. Not only that, he was outstanding as he marshalled the back line alongside Ruben Dias in Dortmund, helping Martinez’s team to a victory which allowed them to clinch their place in the knockout stages. “If there was a neutral guy watching the game and he saw Pepe playing he would never believe he is 41 years old,” Martinez said. “He is an example, a professional, the way he reads the game, the way he competes. “He uses the 24 hours to be a professional footballer,” Martinez added when asked how Pepe manages to continue competing at such a high level when most players his age have long since retired. “We all know players who maybe only spend two hours a day preparing themselves. The rest of the time they live life normally and expect one day to retire. “Pepe doesn’t do that. He uses 24 hours to get himself recovered. When he is not recovering he makes sure he has the right sleep patterns. “Everything is down to the detail and the focus is to play for another year. Then it is just that love for the game, focusing on knowing the opposition, knowing tactical aspects,” added Martinez. Pepe was born in Brazil but went on to represent Portugal after moving there as a young player and becoming naturalised. – ‘Genetics you can’t buy’ – He made his debut for the national team as a 24-year-old in 2007, playing alongside Cristiano Ronaldo who is still his teammate now at the age of 39. In fact, Ronaldo is just behind Pepe as the next oldest outfield player to participate at the Euros. Pepe is now playing at his fifth European Championship, one fewer than Ronaldo. Both were pillars of the side that won Euro 2016 in France. “He is a wonderful example, but of course the body needs to follow. He has genetics that I don’t think you can buy anywhere,” joked Martinez of Pepe, who played 34 games in the season just finished for Porto, including seven in the Champions League. “I think he is an example for all young players of how a player can extend his career by what he does 24 hours a day.” Portugal are one of the favourites to win another Euros in Germany with the experience of Pepe and Ronaldo — former teammates at Real Madrid — added to the immense strength in depth and exciting young talent also available to Martinez. Saturday’s win saw them cruise through to the last 16 with one group game against Georgia still to come, in Gelsenkirchen on Wednesday. The coach might be tempted to rest Pepe as he eyes several changes ahead of a last-16 tie in Frankfurt on July 1. “We are first in the group and we can make changes in the next game which for me is very important as there are lots of players in the dressing room who deserve to play,” said Martinez, who notably has two supremely gifted young defenders waiting in the wings in Goncalo Inacio (22) and Antonio Silva (20). “They showed that during the training camp before the tournament in Portugal. We need to give them opportunities to see how competitive they are.” Stay updated with the latest from Euro 2024 . Explore Euro 2024 Match Today.

    "article_content": "Published By : Ritayan Basu AFP Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 09:03 IST Dortmund EURO 2024: Fan hounds Cristiano Ronaldo for a selfie (AP) Portugal coach Roberto Martinez said it was lucky that none of the multiple fans who invaded the pitch during his team’s Euro 2024 game against Turkey on Saturday had ill intentions after several supporters ran on looking for a selfie with Cristiano Ronaldo. The Group F match in Dortmund, which Portugal won 3-0, was interrupted on several occasions in the second half as pitch invaders got away from security in an attempt to take a photograph with the 39-year-old superstar. The first fan, a young boy wearing a red tracksuit top, emerged from the stand behind the benches midway through the second half and made his way towards the Portugal skipper. Ronaldo posed smiling for a photo before the pitch invader ran off trying to escape stewards. They eventually caught up with him and escorted him away to applause from the stands. At least five other fans managed to get onto the pitch atempting to pull off the same stunt, either during the match or after the final whistle, but Ronaldo grew increasingly exasperated with the unwanted attention. “It is a concern because today we were lucky that the intentions of the fans were good,” Martinez told reporters following the match, after Portugal secured qualification for the last 16. “I think that we all love a fan who recognises the big stars who are icons in their lands. “I think we all agree with that, but you can understand that it is a very difficult moment if those intentions are wrong. “Then the players are exposed and we need to be careful with that. Probably there is a lot of security and protection and I don’t think it should happen.” Martinez, the Spanish former Belgium boss, added: “Probably we should give a message to the fans that it is not the right way. “You are not going to get anything out of it and what you do is that probably the measures get worse for the future and it is not good to get the players so exposed when you get people running on the pitch.” However, Ronaldo is one of the most recognisable celebrities on the planet and his teammate Bernardo Silva — who scored the first goal in the game — admitted all the attention was the price to pay for such levels of fame. “I am not really concerned. It is just a bit annoying in terms of always having to stop the game because a fan enters the pitch,” Manchester City player Silva said. “Apart from that I thnk that is the price you pay for being so recognised in the world of football. But in terms of feeling in danger I don’t think so, not me personally at least.” Stay updated with the latest from Euro 2024 . Explore Euro 2024 Match Today.

(PTI File) Amid the concern in government over integrity of various competitive examinations such as National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and University Grants Commission (UGC) that has prompted deferment and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probes, the country’s premier examination body, Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), has decided to roll out new measures to prevent any chance of cheating or unfair means. Over 26 lakh candidates appear for 23 different examinations conducted by UPSC in a calendar year, including over 10 lakh in the Civil Services Preliminary Examination every May. The UPSC had on June 10 invited bids to make use of the latest digital technology to match and cross-check the biometric details of the candidates and to monitor various activities of the candidates during the examination to prevent cheating, fraud, unfair means and impersonation. Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) with the requisite expertise can apply. “The Commission desires to incorporate Aadhaar-based fingerprint authentication (else digital fingerprint capturing) and facial recognition of candidates, scanning of QR Code of e-Admit Cards and monitoring through live AI-based CCTV video surveillance,” the UPSC has said in the tender document accessed by News18. UPSC is a constitutional body which has an impeccable record in conducting examinations for appointment to the services of the Union – for induction to Group ‘A’ and Group ‘B’ posts of the Government of India. The move comes amid a series of controversies around competitive examinations, with a CBI probe being ordered regarding complaints of certain irregularities in the conduct of NEET-UG, postponement of UGC-NET and the NEET-PG examinations this month. The Ministry of Education has also set up constitutes a High-Level Committee of Experts to ensure transparent, smooth and fair conduct of examinations and suggest reform in the structure and functioning of the National Testing Agency (NTA) and re-look at data security. The UPSC conducts 23 different examinations across 3,000 venues at 80 centres across the country. The Commission says it will provide candidate details like name, roll number, and photo etc seven days prior to the date of commencement of exam for use in the Aadhaar-based fingerprint authentication (else digital fingerprint capturing) process, facial recognition and QR code scanning of e-admit cards. The service provider will maintain the entire database and application server at two different seismic zones within India, one site as DC (Data Centre) and other site as DR (Disaster Recovery). It has been stipulated that the service provider shall maintain strict secrecy and confidentiality and will not divulge any information relating to assignment or examination to any third party, person, individual or body corporate. The biometric authentication and QR code scanning will ensure impersonation control at the examination centres. A provision will also be made for real-time attendance monitoring system through secured web server as well as real-time monitoring of the enrolment activity along with GPS coordinates. All data captured at each examination venue is to be intimated to UPSC 30 minutes before the end of each shift of the examination. QR code on the admit card would be scanned to auto-fetch the candidate’s details from the application database provided by the UPSC. This will be followed by Aadhaar-based fingerprint authentication else digital fingerprint capturing of candidate’s fingerprint data. The service provider shall then perform facial recognition of the candidate by a hand-held device before he/she is allowed to sit for the exam. The UPSC will also implement CCTV video surveillance with recording and live broadcast system to monitor various activities of the candidates and other persons deployed to conduct the commission’s examinations, the document says. Adequate number of CCTV colour cameras will be installed in every classroom (minimum 1 CCTV camera for 24 candidates), entry/exit gate and the control room where pre-examination sensitive material will be kept and opened and post-examination sensitive material will be packed. The cameras will generate alerts if any movement is detected at entry/exit gates during examination, if the furniture inside the classrooms is not properly arranged, or if the cameras are offline or are tempered by masking or black screen page. Alerts will also be generated if there is any movement in classrooms one hour before or after the exam, if inactivity is detected in invigilator’s movement or in case of detection of crowd, fight, or conflict inside the classroom or if a mobile phone is detected inside the classroom with anyone. “The AI should raise red flags at incidences, which would indicate cheating, unfair means, absence of invigilators, etc. The CCTV cameras should cover each and every candidate in exam venue without any blind spots such that every candidate is visible,” the UPSC document says. The cameras will be connected to the Internet to relay the data to the control room setup at UPSC, New Delhi. UPSC installs jammers at every examination venue which are functional 30 minutes before the start of the exam till 30 minutes after completion of all sessions of the exam."

    "article_content": "Published By : Aditi Ray Chowdhury PTI Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 15:24 IST Mumbai, India Varsha Gaikwad (Illustration: Santanu Kumar Santan / News18) As many as 16 senior leaders of the Mumbai Congress have demanded that its city unit chief Varsha Gaikwad be replaced so as to strengthen the organisation ahead of the Maharashtra assembly polls due in October this year. They feel that Gaikwad, who recently won the Mumbai North Central Lok Sabha seat, will not have time to work at the organisational level and have objected to her style of functioning, sources said on Monday. These leaders, in a letter dated June 16, have sought time from the Congress leadership to discuss rejuvenation of the party in Mumbai ahead of the assembly elections, and the Mumbai civic polls which are overdue. Signatories of the letter include Rajya Sabha MP and Congress Working Committee member Chandrakant Handore, former city party chiefs Janardhan Chandurkar and Bhai Jagtap, senior leaders Naseem Khan, Suresh Shetty, Madhu Chavan, Charansingh Sapra, Zakir Ahmed and Maharashtra Congress treasurer Amarjit Manhas. Most of these leaders have reached Delhi to meet Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and senior leaders KC Venugopal and Rahul Gandhi to discuss how to strengthen the party in the city, the sources said. A meeting related to Maharashtra is scheduled tomorrow. “Recently, at a protest in connection with the UGC-NET exam chaos, Gaikwad did not call all party leaders at the city unit office. Hence they had to stage a separate protest in suburbs,” a source claimed. ”It is now 13 months she is the city unit head, but she has not spearheaded any substantial activity to galvanize the party cadre,” the source further claimed. Mumbai North Lok Sabha seat’s Congress candidate Bhushan Patil has also claimed he received no help from the city party unit. ”Patil has also complained that he did not get a lead in the Malad assembly segment (in the Lok Sabha poll) held by Congress MLA Aslam Sheikh,” the source said. In the 2019 Maharashtra assembly polls, the Congress won only 4 of the 36 seats in Mumbai. During the recently-concluded Lok Sabha elections, the Congress bagged 1 of the 2 seats it contested in the city."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Namit Singh Sengar News18.com Last Updated: June 03, 2024, 12:57 IST New Delhi, India Generally, recovery proceedings are undertaken by the jurisdictional Deputy or Assistant Commissioner of Central Tax. The CBIC has said the Principal Commissioner or commissioner-level officers can issue directions to recover GST dues before the stipulated three months of serving the demand order. Under the GST law, if a taxable person does not pay the amount specified in an order passed under the CGST Act within three months from the date of service of such order, the tax officer can initiate recovery proceedings only after the expiry of this period. However, in exceptional cases where it is necessary in the interest of revenue, the proper officer, after recording the reasons in writing, may ask a taxable person to pay the amount within a period shorter than three months. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) said it has been brought to its notice that some of the field formations are initiating recovery before the specified period of three months from the date of service of the order, even in the cases where the taxable person has not been specifically required by the proper officer, for reasons to be recorded in writing, for payment of such amount within a lesser period. “Therefore, in order to ensure uniformity in the implementation of the provisions of law across the field formations, the board hereby issues the following instructions to be followed in cases where it is necessary, in the interest of revenue, to initiate recovery before the period of three months from the date of service of the order,” the CBIC said. Generally, recovery proceedings are undertaken by the jurisdictional Deputy or Assistant Commissioner of Central Tax. In cases where early recovery is deemed necessary, the jurisdictional Deputy or Assistant Commissioner must present the case, along with the reasons for early recovery, to the jurisdictional Principal Commissioner or Commissioner of Central Tax, the CBIC said. If satisfied with the reasons, the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner must record these reasons in writing. Upon recording the reasons in writing, the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner may issue directions to the concerned taxable person to pay the specified amount in less than three months from the order’s service date. Uniformity in Dealing With Cases Ranjeet Mahtani, partner, Dhruva Advisors, highlighted that in the GST regime, orders are now being passed thick and fast. Upon an order being passed, a taxpayer may appeal against it or admit and pay the demand amount (typically, comprising tax, interest, and penalty). The statute permits a taxpayer a certain time to prefer an appeal (three months) and so, for disputed demands no amount is payable, at least, till three months from the communication of the order date. Mahtani added that at the time of filing an appeal, prescribed pre-deposit (i.e. a per cent age of the tax demand) is required to be deposited with the exchequer. In a nutshell, a taxpayer who intends to challenge an order by way of a further appeal need not pay any portion of the disputed amount till the expiry of three months and, simultaneous with preferring an appeal must mandatorily pay the pre-deposit amount. “Now, some tax officers tend to be over-zealous in attempting recovery of the demand amount before the said three-month timeframe. The CBIC’s latest instructions of 30th May 2024, reiterate that, in the ordinary course, no recovery can be made until the completion of three months of the communication of order. This stance also ensures that the taxpayer’s appellate rights are not rendered infructuous,” Mahtani said. Exceptional Cases Mahtani added that the instructions have guidelines to uniformly deal with cases that deserve recovery proceedings of tax dues in a timeframe lesser than three months of communication of an order. “Such a measure must be undertaken wherever it is expedient “in the interest of revenue”, and not in all cases; in other words, in exceptional cases. The instructions identify the competent officer and what his responsibilities are before requiring a taxpayer to pay up, in a timeframe that is lesser than that statutorily allowed,” Mahtani said. Moore Singhi executive director Rajat Mohan said this instruction balances safeguarding revenue and maintaining ease of doing business. Guidelines and mandating proper documentation for early recovery actions, the instructions enhance transparency and predictability in tax administration. “It is also hoped that state tax administrations will issue similar instructions to address the challenges faced by taxpayers under state jurisdictions. This coordinated approach would further streamline tax compliance and foster a fairer tax environment across the country,” Mohan added."

England bundled out the USA for 115 runs as Chrish Jordan registered a four-wicket haul, which included a hattrick before skipper Jos Buttler’s impeccable, unbeaten 83 off 38 deliveries took his side over the line with 62 deliveries to spare. England was on the money right from the powerplay against the United States. But the talk of the town will be the local boy Chris Jordan who managed to take a hat-trick in the final over to restrict the USA to just 115 runs. England were all over the American side as Buttler’s onslaught took the game away from the co-hosts and ensured that the holders would cruise into the final-four of the event.

England reached the semifinals of the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 in the Caribbean as they posted a 10-wicket win over the USA at the Kensington Oval on Sunday. Jos Buttler’s brilliant half-century helped England chase down the target of 116 with 62 balls to spare! Buttler: 83* (38) Salt: 25* (21) ENG 117/0 in 9.4 overs BEAT USA 115 in 19.4 overs! Jos Buttler brings up his half-century! And the English skipper does so in style as he smashes Harmeet for SIX down the ground. He replicates the same in the next delivery, only this time the MAXIMUM is hit on the leg side. Buttler goes down the ground again with an authoritative SIX over long off. And he follows up the sequence with another SIX. The spinner hampers the motif with a wide, but the next legal delivery is also smashes away for SIX by the brilliant Buttler! ENG 110/0 in 9 overs! Another smoking drive off the bat of Phil Salt, who powers the ball through the off-side for FOUR runs. Van Schalkwyk looks like leaking more runs as he gives away a no-ball and a free-hit to follow it. But the seamer does well to come up with a dot on the penalty delivery. ENG 74/0 in 7.2 overs! Ali Khan goes for ten runs as he is played for three singles and three singles, of which one comes off a wide delivery. England cruising towards the target. ENG 70/0 in 7 overs! Fifty-up for England! Buttler and Salt trade singles to bring up the fifty run opening stand. Salt looks to go for a big one, but the ball only goes for FOUR due to some good fortune as a failed attempt at a diving effort to take the batter’s catch at deep does not break USA’s way and the ball rolls away to the advertisement foam. Salt puts the next ball away to FOUR as well, this time much more convincingly as he reverse sweeps the ball for FOUR more past the fielder at square. ENG 58/0 in 5.4 overs! Salt in on the act as he plays a cracking drive through the off to send the ball racing to the ropes for FOUR runs. ENG 48/0 in 5 overs! Ali Khan comes in for his first over and he has a nightmarish start as he gives away a wide that beats the bater, beats the keeper and runs away for FOUR runs behind the wicket! Buttler keeps the charge going with another FOUR over the head of mid-on. ENG 37/0 in 4 overs! The English captain seems to be in a bit of a rush here as he takes Kenjige to the ropes, over the head of mid on for a FOUR after a couple of bounces on the on-side. ENG 31/0 in 3.3 overs! The English get thier first FOUR of the day through skipper Buttler! The brilliant batter drives one through covers for a boundary as he comes across the wicket to meet the ball better. He does even better the next delivery as he smacks the ball straight over the head of the bowler to dispatch the ball over the top for a huge SIX. Buttler repeats his feat in the next delivery as he picks up SIX more runs through another maximum, this time with a rather one-handed shot. ENG 24/0 in 2.5 overs! Harmeet is tossed the ball by Aaron Jones for the second over of the innings and the spinner does well to limit the English openers to just four runs off his over without being taken to the ropes. ENG 6/0 in 2 overs! A cautious start to the chase by England! But, from the other side of the glass, USA will consider that a tidy start to their defence of the low total! A couple of single is all the English can pick up off the impressive Netravalkar. ENG 2/0 in 1 over! First ball of the chase! Phil Salt and Jos Buttler open the innings for England! Saurabh Netravalkar with the new ball for the USA! England need 116 runs to win in 20 overs! It will be all about the local boy from Barbados, Chris Jordan who helps England clean up the United States with a last-over hat-trick to boost England’s chances of a semi-final spot. Now England will have their NRR calculations and will hope that they can chase this down quickly to get the win and confirm their spot in the semi-finals. USA 115/10 in 18.5 Overs – WICKET! That’s a hat-trick for Chris Jordan. The nipbacker comes into play once again and the ball crashes onto the stumps to make it a hat-trick for the hometown boy. Started off his journey in Barbados and now he will lead England off with a hat-trick. Saurabh Netravalkar 0(1) b. C Jordan USA 115/9 in 18.4 Overs – WICKET! Chris Jordan is on the money once again and the delivery tailing back in seems to have missed the edge from the bat and is hitting the pads. Looks plumb, the umpire raises the finger but the batter goes for the review. Ultraedge shows no nicks and ball-tracking shows it is hitting the stumps. Nosthush Kenjige 0(1) lbw b. C Jordan USA 115/8 in 18.3 Overs – WICKET! Chris Jordan gets his second in the over and the length delivery slightly tailing back into the right-hander gets through the batter and crashes onto the stumps to get Ali Khan out for a duck. Muhammad Ali-Khan 0(2) b. C Jordan USA 115/7 in 18.1 Overs – WICKET! England have the big wicket of Corey Anderson. Jordan comes in and goes for the yorker and finds the man at the mid-wicket boundary ropes who takes the catch easily. Corey Anderson 29(28) c. H Brook b. C Jordan USA 115/6 in 17.6 Overs – WICKET! Sam Curran gives away the full-toss but Harmeet fails to middle the delivery and finds the man at long-off, Chris Jordan who takes the catch with ease and gives England another wicket with two overs to go. Harmeet Singh 21(17) c. C Jordan b. S Curran USA 115/5 in 17.5 Overs – FOUR! SIX! Harmeet Singh gets the USA the much-needed boundary here. Advances down the track and picks up the delivery towards the extra cover region for some crucial runs as the innings come to a close soon. He follows it up with a maximum which is now clobbered towards the mid-wicket region for six runs. Harry Brook puts in the dive but is unable to take the catch. USA 95/5 in 15.2 Overs – FOUR! Jofra Archer comes back into the attack and Harmeet Singh goes after the length delivery. Seems like it was the cutter and lacked the pace which resulted in the batter just smashing it away towards the deep point region for the boundary.

    "article_content": "Curated By : Amar Sunil Panicker News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 06:49 IST Saint Lucia Check out the possible scenarios in Group 1 of the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup 2024. (AFP) The race to the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup 2024 is certainly heating up and Group 1 has turned out to be a feisty lot of teams with each member having a chance of a spot in the next stage of the tournament. This occurred after Afghanistan managed to shock the world and create an upset in the tournament by beating the mighty Australia by 21 runs at the Arnos Vale Stadium in Kingstown. Now the Aussies will take on India while Afghanistan takes on Bangladesh as part of their final game of the Super Eights and the outcomes of these fixtures will decide how each side’s future in the tournament will pan out. Check out the possible scenarios below: Despite winning both their games in the Super 8, the Indian team led by Rohit Sharma are still in danger of suffering a shock exit from the tournament. They would have to lose against Australia convincingly and Afghanistan could come in if they can beat Bangladesh by a massive margin to take their net run rate above India’s. If Australia win by 41 runs or more while batting first, or 32 balls or more left while chasing, they will move ahead of India. And if Afghanistan beat Bangladesh by 81 runs or more, Afghanistan could possibly pip India to the second spot, thus knocking out India. The mighty Aussies are truly in danger of a Super 8 exit in the ongoing tournament. For Australia to be knocked out, they would have to lose their upcoming game against India which gives either Afghanistan to take the second spot with a win or Bangladesh could come in and snatch the remaining spot on net run-rate. For the Afghans to create history and take them into the T20 World Cup 2024 semi-finals for the first time, there are two possible scenarios. In an ideal scenario, they would want India to take down Australia and possibly by a big margin. This would mean that Australia would have just two points. Afghanistan would then have to beat Bangladesh to secure four points and qualify. Another possible situation is if Australia beat India, then Afghanistan would have to beat Bangladesh convincingly to get their net run rate above the Aussies. Bangladesh despite losing their first two games, remain in the hunt. For a top 2 finish, they would first hope that Australia lose against India by a margin of 55 runs or 41 balls. Then the Bangla Tigers would have to secure a win in their final game against Afghanistan by 31 runs or 23 balls. To summarise, each team has to essentially win their final Super 8 game, by a massive margin if possible to account for the net run rate. The tournament has certainly gotten spicier as we head into the business end. If India’s final Super 8 game against Australia gets washed out then both teams would get a point each, resulting in qualification for India with five points while Australia would finish with 3. But if Afghanistan win their game against Bangladesh the former would be on 4 points taking them above Australia at second position and thus qualifying for the semi-finals.

    "article_content": "Curated By : Siddarth Sriram News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 10:48 IST WI vs SA Highlights, T20 World Cup, Super 8: Shai Hope went from having the best of times to committing the worst of crimes, as the match-winning batter was dismissed for a golden duck by Jansen with the third delivery of the first over, as West Indies’ hopes were hit hard out the gate. The misery would only pile on though, as Markram, who took the ball next, also struck instantly, removing the swashbuckling Pooran for a mere run, and it all seemed bleak for the hosts. South Africa were running high, and Roston Chase stepped up to break the deadlock with a couple of blitzing boundaries to get off the mark and ease the pressure. But, South Africa would almost strike again, tempting Chase to sky one high, only for Nortje to drop the catch and provide another life for Chase — a mistake South Africa would go on to regret. Chase, alongside opener Kyle Mayers, took the attack to South Africa, swiping away at boundaries galore, as the duo rebuilt their side’s innings in fine fashion, bringing them up from 5/2 to 69/2 by the halfway mark. South Africa would not fold though, as they turned the tide around with the introductions of spinners Shamsi and Maharaj. Shamsi in particular would run riot over the West Indians, dazzling with perfect line and composure, to scalp both the dangerous Mayers and Sherfane Rutherford in quick succession, before finally removing the dangerman Chase after he reached his fifty. In a seemingly bizarre move, Rabada wouldn’t be introduced to bowl till the 18th over. But, the move turned out to be one of brilliance as his introduction would lead to the immediate dismissals of both Andre Russell and Akeal Hosein in the same over, as West Indies went down 8 wickets. All-in-all, a spirited fight from the tail-enders would help the West Indies muster up 135 runs, leaving it all up to South Africa to take the win, if they so please. And it sure seemed like they wanted the win bad, as Quinton de Kock got off to a blazing start, punishing Akeal Hosein for three fours in the very first over itself. But, cometh the hour cometh the man, as Andre Russell stepped up with the ball to scalp both de Kock and his strike partner Reeza Hendricks in the same over, pushing South Africa to a cautious 15/2, right before rains stopped play. The consistent shoers could have rained on the West Indies’ hopes had the match been abandoned, but lucky for them, a revised target of 123 from 123 was set for South Africa. Stubbs, the new man in, instantly went to work, slashing for boundaries, as Hosein failed to inspire any change. But, one man who would end up doing so, would be Alzarri Joseph. The pacer instantly found the breakthrough for West Indies, removing Markram and then the hard-hitting Klaasen after he went on an onslaught of Motie, to swing momentum back towards the hosts. A spirited spell from the likes of Andre Russell and Alzarri Joseph ensued, as the pace dup kept a patient Stubbs at bay, wringing the game out. The biggest twist in the tale was yet to come, and it occurred with the introduction of off-spinner Roston Chase. Chase, in classic fashion this tournament, choked out the Proteas batters, keeping his lines tight, and turned the game around once again, when he claimed the wickets of David Miller and most importantly, Tristan Stubbs, who fell victim in the 14th over. The momentum had completely turned around to favour the hosts, as the crowds roared them on, and South Africa kept it close, inching towards the target through the storm with Marco Jansen and Keshav Maharaj at the crease. Needing 13 runs from 12 balls, Chase was entrusted with the ball one last time, and he delivered again, removing Maharaj and piling the pressure onto Jansen and new man Rabada. But, the ace pacer Rabada kept his cool to drive confidently for a stellar four to end the over, and needing 5 to win from the last over, Jansen finished it off in style, pummelling McCoy for a six straight down the ground to seal the deal.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) South Africa made it to the T20 World Cup 2024 Semi-final from Group 2 with a nervy win over co-hosts West Indies to join England from Group 2 of Super 8, both teams will now await the top two teams from Group 1 to complete the semi-final fixtures. South Africa, unbeaten in the tournament so far, coming into their final Super 8 fixture were in a strange predicament of being in a must-win encounter to book their spot in the final 4, while England, who lost to Australia and South Africa and had a washout game against Scotland, became the first team to make the final 4 on the back of 10-wicket drubbing of the USA in their final Super 8 fixture. South Africa started off well restricting WI to just 135/8 on a tricky wicket riding on Tabraiz Shamsi’s 3//27 and a complete bowling performance. But, in the chase, their old nemesis, rain, appeared with the chase curtailed to 17 overs and a revised target of 123. SA lost Quinton de Kock and Reeza Hendricks in quick time but Tristian Stubbs and Heinrich Klassen stabilized the chase. However, there was more drama in store as South Africa nearly choked at the crucial juncture. The introduction of Roston Chase changed the momentum of the game as the spinner got the wickets of David Miller and Stubbs to leave SA reeling but Marco Jansen held his nerve and finished off the game to bring joy to the SA camp, while it was despair for WI. Co-hosts West Indies and USA have now been knocked out of the competition, while all four teams from Group 1 Super 8 are still vying for the remaining two spots in the final. As per the current standings, South Africa have topped Group 2 with 6 points and they should play the first semi-final, meaning they will avoid India (if they make it) and play Australia or Afghanistan, depending on who makes it to the semis. England, on the other hand, may run into India (if they make it) in the 2nd semi-final. The first semifinal in Trinidad on June 26 is a night affair (6:00 AM IST) while the second semi-final in Guyana is a day game (8:30 PM IST), more suited for the Indian TV audience. India, irrespective of where they finish in their Super 8 group, will play the second semi-final. “The Final on 29 June will have a reserve day on 30 June. The semi-finals will each have additional time added in order to complete the match which will total 250 minutes. “For the first semi-final on 26 June, 60 minutes will be available at the end of the day’s play with the remaining 190 minutes scheduled for 2pm on 27 June. “If India qualifies for the semi-finals, they will play in the second semi-final scheduled for Guyana on the 27 June 2024,” stated the playing conditions.

    "article_content": "Published By : Namit Singh Sengar PTI Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 10:03 IST New Delhi, India Sixty-eight per cent of Indians believe the world needs to take dramatic action in the next decade across all sectors of the economy. (Representative image) As G20 finance ministers prepare to consider a wealth tax on the super-rich next month, a survey has revealed that 68 per cent of people in these countries, including 74 per cent in India, support the idea to address global hunger, inequality and climate crisis. The proposal for a levy on the super-rich has been under discussion since at least 2013 with international support on the issue growing over the years. Brazil, the current president of the G20, aims to build consensus on the taxation of wealth and is likely to push for a joint declaration at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in July. Gabriel Zucman, a French economist and a key influencer behind Brazil’s G20 proposal for progressive international taxation to promote tax justice, will release a report on Tuesday, outlining how “a global minimum tax on the ultra-rich” could work and how much it could raise. According to Zucman, the super-rich pay significantly less tax than the ordinary people. The proposal aims to establish a new international standard: billionaires in every country would be required to pay at least 2 per cent of their wealth in taxes annually. Seventy-four per cent of Indians support taxing wealth. Tax on high incomes and corporations to fund climate initiatives alongside a ‘polluter pays’ approach with income redistribution are also strongly supported, he said. Seventy-one per cent of Indians endorse universal basic income, 74 per cent support policies that encourage healthy diets to cut emissions, and 76 per cent seek a better work-life balance. Sixty-eight per cent of Indians believe the world needs to take dramatic action in the next decade across all sectors of the economy — electricity generation, transport, buildings, industry, and food. Eighty-one per cent of the Indians surveyed support a shift to “wellbeing economies” that have a stronger focus on health and the environment than a narrow focus on economic growth."

India will be playing Australia tonight and a win will ensure their top place in the group and most likely end of the road for Australia. If that happens India will take on England in the second semi-final at Providence Stadium, Guyana on June 27 (8:00 PM IST). And this will make for an interesting contest with the defending champions, England, taking on the overwhelming favourites, India, for a spot in the final – a repeat of the T20 World Cup 2022 semi-final. On November 10, 2022, England faced India at the Adelaide Oval in the 2nd semi-final of the T20 World Cup 2022, and England, the eventual winners, led by a demolition act from Jos Buttler and Alex Hales decimated India by 10 wickets, chasing down the target of 169, in just 16 overs and 10 wickets intact. That game forced India to change their T20 batting template and India will have a chance to redeem themselves at Guyana come June 27. South Africa have topped Group 2 and they will play the first semi-final, meaning they will avoid India (if they make it) and play Australia, Afghanistan or Bangladesh, depending on who makes it to the semis. England, on the other hand, may run into India, if they they top their Super 8 group. The first semifinal in Trinidad on June 26 is a night affair (6:00 AM IST) while the second semi-final in Guyana is a day game (8:30 PM IST), more suited for the Indian TV audience.

    "article_content": "Live now Curated By : Vineet Ramakrishnan , Feroz Khan & Amar Sunil Panicker News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 14:41 IST India’s squad for Zimbabwe T20Is announcement live: The Ajit Agarkar-led BCCI selection committee is expected to meet today to pick India’s T20I squad for the Zimbabwe series that starts in the first week of July. India will be touring Zimbabwe for a five-match series starting July 7 with all matches to be played at the Harare Sports Club. In all likeliness, it will be a new-look squad with the senior players to be rested on account of a busy first six months that includes the ongoing T20 World Cup. CricketNext has learnt that BCCI has already collected the passports of a few players who will be flying to Zimbabwe for the series. Among the players who are currently not part of India’s T20 World Cup campaign, Shubman Gill, Avesh Khan, Mukesh Kumar among others are likely to be picked. There’s also a strong possibility that the likes of Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav will be rested meaning a there could be a surprise in the captaincy department. This will be India’s fourth tour to Zimbabwe for a T20I series after having earlier visited the African nation in 2010, 2015 and 2016. The Indian team, led by Rohit Sharma, is currently in the Caribbean region for the second round of the T20 World Cup.

More from our correspondent, Sahil Malhotra * Dhruv Jurel and Riyan Parag, the two players in the targetted group, are training at the Rajasthan Royals’ high performance centre in Talegaon. As per plan, the duo are likely to train at the facility for a week. * Lot of action in BCCI corridors today as various representatives of the state associations will be in attendance to watch live stream of India vs Australia match and also hold informal discussions on Indian cricket. Most will be seeing the BCCI office for the first time today The wait continues for India squad for India tour of Zimbabwe. The squad sheet was supposed to be out during the weekend but there has been a delay. It is learnt that some of the selected players have been informed and their passports and jersey sizes have already been collected, reports CricketNext correspondent Sahil Malhotra It is likely that BCCI could go ahead and announce a jumbo 20-member provisional squad for the 5-match T20I series to accommodate as many young players as possible. Maharashtra and CSK pacer Tushar Deshpande is likely to be among the young crop of pacers who could get a call-up to the national team. Deshpande was a regular fixture in CSK’s playing XI, often used as impact sub. Other pacers in fray are Harshit Rana, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Avesh Khan and Khaleel Ahmed. As per a report in the Indian Express, The senior selection committee checked with Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav if they wanted to travel to Zimbabwe but both have declined. India could try young pace-bowling all rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy on the tour. Reddy had won BCCI’s emerging player of the year award. So, as per latest reports, Shubman Gill is likely to be named captain for the T20I series against Zimbabwe. Gill was part of the India’s T20 World Cup 2024 reserve players list, was released from the squad during the league stages alongside Avesh Khan. Gill is likely to link up with the team straight in Zimbabwe It is very much likely that Shreyas Iyer may be named captain for the tour of Zimbabwe if BCCI opt to skip their senior players including Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya. The stars seemed to be aligning for Iyer, who won the IPL 2024 leading Kolkata Knight Riders under the mentorship of Gautam Gambhir, who incidentally is the frontrunner to take over the as India’s head coach Considering India rest their regular players for the tour, here’s a look at the new-look India T20I squad for the Zimbabwe series. This is assuming Inda will rest Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Mohammad Siraj There is a lot of buzz around Riyan Parag and after solid domestic performances, the Assam allrounder had a windfall IPL 2024 season, cementing himself as one of the future. And Parag could very likely to be rewarded with a maiden national call-up in the tour of Zimbabwe. After a long cricket season, BCCI are likely to rest senior players like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah and even Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya, paving way for the youngsterd to make the squad. With BCCI not announcing the India squad for the their tour of Zimbabwe, it is expected that the board might name the squad today before India’s final T20 World Cup 2024 Super 8 match game against Australia tonight. It is already reported that the BCCI is looking to bring in the younger crop of players for the Zimbabwe series. But there could be a few potential surprises in terms of selections or omissions that might be unexpected. Maybe some of the senior players might get some game-time thus meaning that the spots of the youngsters might become less. With a lot of new faces being brought into the squad, it will be imperative to give the new blood some time to get accustomed to the demands of international cricket. Most of our current senior starts did take some time during their early years to get used to the expectations and demands of the format. With a lot of fresh faces expected to be included in the squad, we might get to see the future of India’s T20 Cricket squad make their debuts and there could be the next big star who just might get their big break. The series could provide an opportunity for the BCCI and Indian fans to have a look at a makeshift squad of players knocking on the doors of national selectors with their performances in the shortest format of the game across various tournaments. We could witness a fresh-look outfit representing the nation on the Zimbabwe tour with a whole stream of young players waiting to be called up to the national squad. A number of promising talents, who missed out on the flight to North America for the T20 World Cup, could be picked for the five-match T20I series in Africa. With the succession of the role of the Indian national cricket team’s head coach yet unannounced, legendary batter VVS Laxman is set to accompany the side on tour. It is expected that a younger crop of players will be called up to sport the famous blue kit in Harare with the tour being slated just a couple of weeks after the conclusion of the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup in the Caribbean. The Zimbabwe tour will be the first series India will contest after current head coach Rahul Dravid steps from the helm of the team as he had already announced. Gautam Gambhir is touted to be the next coach of the men in blue, with WV Raman also in the mix. The Indian cricket team will be looking to introduce some fresh faces into the squad and the Zimbabwe tour will play as the perfect testing ground to see what these youngsters are made of. Hopefully the Indian team can uncover the next big gem that will go on to dominate the sport for years to come. The pair of Shreyas Iyer and Ishan Kishan have been out of action from International cricket for quite some time now. The two also were axed from the BCCI’s central contract list. Iyer has gone on to lead the KKR to victory while Kishan might be struggling for form. The Zimbabwe tour could be the perfect opportunity to see the two come back and possibly make a run for a permanent spot in the side.

Spotted a mistake in your ITR? Don’t sweat it! Here’s your chance to hit the rewind button. An Updated Income Tax Return, also known as ITR-U, is a way to rectify mistakes or omissions made in a previously filed ITR. It essentially allows you to re-file your return for a particular assessment year. The Finance Act 2022 Updated Return: The Finance Act 2022 introduced subsection (8A) in section 139 of the Income Tax Act, allowing for the filing of an updated return. In 2022, the union government proposed that taxpayers could file this updated return within two years from the end of the relevant assessment year, subject to the payment of additional tax. Why An Updated Return Provision? The provision was unveiled by Union Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during the presentation of the Union Budget for the financial year 2022-23. FM Sitharaman expressed that this provision would allow taxpayers to rectify any omissions or errors in accurately assessing their income for tax purposes. She further highlighted that in cases where the Income Tax department identifies missed income by the taxpayer, it typically entails a protracted adjudication process. The proposal aims to instil trust in taxpayers. She had said “It is an affirmative step in the direction of voluntary tax compliance.” Updated ITR: Highlights Who Can File An Updated ITR? According to details outlined by Income Tax India on its website, the section stipulates that any individual can submit an updated return, regardless of whether they’ve previously filed the original, belated, or revised return for the applicable assessment year. An updated return can be lodged within 24 months from the conclusion of the pertinent assessment year. Nonetheless, there are certain circumstances under which an updated return cannot be submitted. For example: When Is ITR-U Not Available? An updated return is ineligible for submission if it pertains to a return reporting a loss. Furthermore, it is not permissible to file an updated return if doing so would reduce the tax liability as calculated based on the original, revised, or belated return filed by the assessee. Additionally, an updated return cannot be filed if it would result in or augment the refund due based on the original, revised, or belated return submitted by the assessee. To file an updated ITR, you need to: Choose between online or offline filing methods. For offline filing: For online filing: If uncertain about the necessity of filing an updated ITR, seek advice from a tax advisor."

(Representative image) The GST Network (GSTN) has rolled out a special form for manufacturers of pan masala and tobacco products to report inputs and outputs procured with tax authorities to check evasion. This new form GST SRM-II came within a month of GSTN rolling out form GST SRM-I for registering machines of such manufacturers. “The second form namely Form GST SRM-II is also available on the portal. Taxpayers dealing in the manufacture of Pan Masala and Tobacco products can now report the details of inputs and outputs procured and consumed for the relevant month,” GSTN said in an update to its taxpayers on June 7. Moore Singhi Executive Director Rajat Mohan said the newly available Form GST SRM-II requires detailed monthly reporting of inputs and outputs. “This form aims to enhance transparency and accountability in the manufacturing process of Pan Masala and Tobacco products. Taxpayers must meticulously document their procurement and consumption of inputs to avoid any discrepancies and ensure accurate tax filings,” Mohan said. Taxpayers are advised to familiarise themselves with the details and instructions provided in these forms to ensure seamless compliance and avoid any potential penalties, he added. In January, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) announced the introduction of a new registration and monthly return filing procedure to improve GST compliance for manufacturers of pan masala and tobacco products effective April 1. The date was later extended to May 15. The move to overhaul the registration, record-keeping, and monthly filing of such businesses was aimed at improving GST compliance for manufacturers of pan masala and tobacco products. The GST law was also amended via Finance Bill 2024 to say that manufacturers of pan masala, gutkha and similar tobacco products will have to pay a penalty of up to Rs 1 lakh, if they fail to register their packing machinery with GST authorities with effect from April 1. However, this penalty provision is yet to be notified. The procedure was to be applicable for manufacturers of pan-masala, unmanufactured tobacco (without lime tube) with or without a brand name, ’Hookah’ or ’gudaku’ tobacco, smoking mixtures for pipes and cigarettes, chewing tobacco (without lime tube), filter khaini, jarda scented tobacco, snuff and branded or unbranded ’Gutkha’, etc. The manufacturers of such tobacco products were required to furnish the details of packing machines being used for filling and packing of packages in Form GST SRM-I, electronically within 30 days of the notification coming into effect i.e., April 1, 2024.

    "article_content": "Curated By : Namit Singh Sengar News18.com Last Updated: June 09, 2024, 13:29 IST New Delhi, India The Income-tax Department updates the TDS details in Form 26AS based on details provided by the person deducting the tax. (Representative image) TDS stands for Tax Deducted at Source. It’s a mechanism implemented by the government to collect income tax right at the time the income is generated, instead of waiting for the taxpayer to file their return. The purpose of TDS is to ensure a regular flow of tax revenue to the government and prevent tax evasion. The TDS deducted is credited to the payee’s income tax account and can be claimed against their final tax liability while filing the income tax return. Also Read: Form 16 vs Form 26AS: Before ITR Filing Here’s What You Need To Know Form 26AS acts as a consolidated statement that links TDS deducted at source to your income tax information. Part A of Form 26AS captures details of all TDS deducted from your income throughout the financial year. This includes information like: Verification and Filing: By comparing the TDS information in form 26AS with your TDS certificates (form 16 for salaried individuals and form 16A for non-salaried individuals), you can verify if the deducted TDS has been deposited correctly by the deductor. Discrepancies In Actual TDS and TDS Credit As Per Form 26AS Everyone who deducts tax at source must provide the Income Tax Department with the details of the tax they have deducted. These details include the name and Permanent Account Number (PAN) of the deductee, the amount of tax deducted, the amount paid to the deductee, the date the TDS was credited to the government, and other relevant information. Using the TDS details furnished by the deductor, the Income Tax Department revises the deductee’s Form 26AS. TDS Mismatch In 26AS Often, there can be disparities between the actual TDS amount and the TDS credit shown in Form 26AS. The TDS credit displayed in Form 26AS might be lower than the actual TDS amount. This can occur due to various reasons such as the deductor failing to furnish TDS details to the Income Tax Department, or deducting tax under an incorrect PAN, among others. What To Do If TDS Is Not Reflected In 26AS? According to the information available on the official website of the Income Tax Department, in such a case the deductee should approach the deductor and request them to take the necessary steps to rectify the discrepancy due to the above reasons. The Income-tax Department updates the TDS details in Form 26AS based on details provided by the person deducting the tax (i.e., the deductor), hence, if there is any default on the part of the deductor like non -furnishing of TDS details (i.e., TDS return) to the Income-tax Department, deducting the tax in incorrect PAN, etc. then form 26AS will not reflect the actual TDS. In such a case, the taxpayer may not be able to claim the credit of the correct TDS. Hence, the taxpayers are advised by the department to confirm the tax credit appearing in form 26AS and should reconcile the difference, if any. ​If the discrepancy is due to the deductor, then they may file a TDS/TCS correction statement and correct the same."

With the release of Form 16, employees can now file their income tax returns (ITR) for Assessment Year (AY) 2024-25. The e-filing process is in full swing, and taxpayers must choose between the new and old tax regimes. Each regime offers distinct benefits and tax rates, making it essential to understand which option aligns best with your financial situation. Also Read: How to File ITR Online for FY24? A Step-by-Step Guide In the latest Budget 2023, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced significant changes to the new tax regime, increasing the income tax exemption limit by Rs 50,000 to Rs 3 lakh. Additionally, the rebate under Section 87A has been raised, meaning individuals earning up to Rs 7 lakh annually do not have to pay any income tax under the new regime. This update aims to simplify tax calculations and provide relief to middle-income taxpayers. Income Tax Rates for FY2023-24 (AY 2024-25): Note: For senior citizens (above 60 years of age), the income tax under the old regime is exempt up to Rs 3,00,000; while for super senior citizens (above 80 years), income up to Rs 5,00,000 is exempt. Key Features and Differences Between the Tax Regimes New Tax Regime: Old Tax Regime: Expert Recommendations: Choosing the Right Tax Regime Tax professionals recommend a thorough evaluation of your financial status, including taxable income, potential deductions, and available exemptions, before selecting a tax regime. The new tax regime is particularly beneficial for individuals with fewer savings and investments, while the old regime might be more advantageous for those who can maximise deductions through various tax-saving instruments. “For those earning up to Rs 7 lakh, the new tax regime is straightforward and beneficial as it results in zero tax liability,” experts suggest. Here are some examples to illustrate which regime might be more beneficial for different financial situations: Low-Income Earners: If your income is up to Rs 7 lakh with minimal deductions, the new regime offers simplicity and zero tax liability. High-income earners with Investments: If you have significant investments in tax-saving instruments, the old regime could reduce your taxable income effectively. The choice between the new and old tax regimes ultimately depends on individual circumstances."

VERIFY: Legitimate communications from Indian Customs include a Document Identification Number (DIN), which can be verified on the CBIC website — https://esanchar.cbic.gov.in/DIN/DINSearch. REPORT: Report fraudulent cases to Cyber Crime Portal (www.cybercrime.gov.in) or helpline number 1930. Common Scam Tactics Used By Fraudsters: Fake Calls/SMS: Fraudsters pose as courier officials, claiming Customs has held a package and demanding duty payments. Pressure Tactics: Impersonators demand money for releasing packages allegedly seized by Customs. Demand for Money: Victims are falsely informed about seized illegal contents (uch as drugs/ foreign currency/ fake passport/ contraband items) in their packages and threatened with legal action unless they pay."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Aparna Deb News18.com Last Updated: June 17, 2024, 12:26 IST New Delhi, India Sanjiv Puri said inflation is probably going to be around 4.5 percent this year on the back of an expected good monsoon. Considering the high levels of inflation, newly-elected CII President Sanjiv Puri said, income tax relief for the people in the lowest slab is likely to be considered in the upcoming full Budget for 2024-25. Last month, Puri, the Chairman and Managing Director of ITC, was appointed as the President of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) for the term 2024-25. In an interview with news agency PTI, he also suggested creation of an institutional platform for consensus building between the Centre and states to successfully carry out all reforms, including those related to land, labour, power and agriculture. The industry body also said it does not see compulsions of coalition politics hampering the reforms in the third term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Instead, it believes that the performance of Indian economy and the success of policies in the previous two stints would set the base to accelerate the process. “Broadly, I would say at this point of time it is public capex, adherence to fiscal glidepath, roadmap for investment in the social infrastructure, green fund and greater investment in the rural sector. These are the broad principles,” he said, when asked about CII’s expectations from the upcoming full Budget for 2024-25. India’s wholesale price index-based inflation rose for the third straight month to 2.61 percent in May on a year-on-year basis as against 1.26 percent a month ago, data from the commerce ministry showed on June 14. Earlier this month, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may consider “further policy actions” only if it is confident of headline inflation staying put at 4 per cent. Das said it is the central bank’s core objective to align the inflation rate with the 4 per cent target, and added that no action on rates will be possible till the RBI is confident of it remaining at or below 4 percent. Puri said inflation is “probably going to be around 4.5 percent this year” on the back of an expected good monsoon, which has in the past led to moderation of food inflation. Speaking of taxes, he added, “What we are suggesting is that the process of simplification should continue. There are certain suggestions relating to capital gains, which are different for different instruments. Can it be rationalised?” Puri further said there are some operational difficulties in TDS (tax deducted at source) and multiplicity of rates and CII would prefer simplification of these. “…over a period of time as far as customs is concerned, we should move to a three-tier structure, primary at the lowest level, intermediates in between and then the finished goods and all over a period of time should be moderate rates with some exclusions, as deemed appropriate,” he added. Under the old regime, Income tax exemption limit is applicable on income up to Rs 2.5 lakh for individuals whereas under the new regime, the exemption limit is on income up to Rs 3 lakh. The CII president also expressed optimism that the reform process should strengthen going forward. Puri said he was hopeful that food prices may moderate on the back of a good monsoon going forward, sharing that CII estimates inflation to be around 4.5 per cent soon, and expects the Reserve Bank to cut the key interest rate somewhere in the second half of the current financial year starting from October. “We think that in the second half of the year, we should see some easing of interest rates,” the CII president said."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Mohammad Haris News18.com Last Updated: June 17, 2024, 15:34 IST New Delhi, India Filing your ITR accurately and on time is crucial to ensure compliance and to avoid unnecessary hassles with the tax authorities. As employees have now received Form 16, they can now file income tax returns (ITR) for the assessment year 2024-24 (or financial year 2023-24). However, if you are filing your ITR, there are some common mistakes that you need to avoid for successful submission of the income tax return. Filing your ITR accurately and on time is crucial to ensure compliance and to avoid unnecessary hassles with the tax authorities. Here are some common mistakes to avoid while filing your ITR for AY 2025. 1. Incorrect Personal Information One of the most frequent mistakes is entering incorrect personal information such as name, address, PAN, and bank details. Ensure that the details match those in your official documents and bank records to avoid any discrepancies that can delay processing or refunds. Double-check all personal information before submitting your ITR. Ensure that your name, PAN, and bank details are correct and up-to-date. 2. Choosing the Wrong ITR Form There are different ITR forms for different types of taxpayers and income sources. Using the wrong form can lead to rejection or processing delays. ITR-1 (Sahaj) for salaried individuals with income up to ₹50 lakh. ITR-2 for individuals and HUFs not having income from business or profession. ITR-3 for individuals and HUFs having income from business or profession. ITR-4 (Sugam) for presumptive income from business and profession. 3. Failure to Report All Income Sources Many taxpayers forget to report additional income sources such as interest from savings accounts, fixed deposits, rental income, or capital gains. Omitting these can result in penalties and interest on unpaid taxes. Gather all financial documents and income statements, including those for interest, dividends, and rental income, to ensure all sources are reported. 4. Not Claiming Eligible Deductions Taxpayers often miss out on claiming deductions under various sections like 80C, 80D, 80E, etc., which can reduce their taxable income significantly. Be aware of all the deductions available under the Income Tax Act and claim them appropriately. Common deductions include investments in PPF, NSC, insurance premiums, home loan interest, and tuition fees. 5. Errors in TDS Details Mismatch between the TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) details in your Form 26AS and the TDS claimed in your ITR can lead to discrepancies and delays in processing. Also, if a PAN is not linked with Aadhaar, TDS is required to be deducted at double the applicable rate. Verify your TDS details in Form 26AS and ensure they match the details you enter in your ITR. 6. Failure to Verify ITR After filing the ITR, it is crucial to verify it either electronically or by sending a signed physical copy to the Centralized Processing Centre (CPC) within 120 days. Unverified ITRs are considered invalid. Prefer e-verification using Aadhaar OTP, net banking, or other available methods for quick processing. 7. Ignoring Income from Previous Employer If you switched jobs during the financial year, make sure to include the income from your previous employer as well. Ignoring this can lead to a notice from the tax department for under-reporting income. Collect Form 16 from all employers and report the aggregate income in your ITR. 8. Incorrect Bank Account Details Providing incorrect bank account details can delay your refund. Ensure that the account number and IFSC code are accurate and updated. Update your bank account details in the ITR form and verify them carefully before submission. 9. Missing Out on Foreign Income If you have income from foreign sources, it must be reported in your ITR. Failing to do so can result in penalties and legal issues, especially for NRIs or those with overseas investments. Include all foreign income and assets in your ITR, and seek professional advice if necessary. 10. Delay in Filing ITR Filing your ITR after the deadline can attract late filing fees, interest on the tax due, and reduced time for revising the return if needed. Aim to file your ITR well before the deadline to avoid last-minute rush and potential errors. Filing your ITR accurately and timely is essential to ensure smooth processing and avoid penalties. By being aware of these common mistakes and taking steps to avoid them, you can ensure that your tax filing process for AY 2025 is hassle-free. When in doubt, consider seeking assistance from a tax professional to navigate the complexities of tax filing."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Namit Singh Sengar News18.com Last Updated: June 18, 2024, 12:09 IST New Delhi, India It can be frustrating to wait for an expected income tax refund. There are a couple of reasons why you might not have received it yet. Income Tax Refund Status 2024: If you’ve filed your tax return expecting a refund, but it hasn’t arrived yet, there could be several reasons for the delay. Income tax refunds can be delayed for various reasons. Let’s explore what might be causing the hold-up and what steps you can take to track down your money. First, if you haven’t received your refund, find these possibilities to determine the cause and take appropriate action. Keep track of any communication from the IT Department and respond promptly if they request additional information or verification. Also Read: How To File ITR 1 Online? Check This Easy Step-by-step Guide Now Income Tax Refund Delay Reason Here are a few key reasons why you might not have received your ITR refund; ITR Processed by the Income Tax Department The Income Tax Department typically takes a few days to process an ITR. If it has been a long time since you filed your ITR, you can check the status of your refund on the ITD website. A refund is issued only after the income tax return has been processed. ITR Refund Eligibility You will receive an Income Tax Return refund only if the Income Tax Department verifies your eligibility upon processing your income tax return. Once your eligibility is confirmed, the refund is typically credited within four weeks. Bank Account Details For an ITR refund to be processed, your bank account must be pre-validated; otherwise, the refund will not be issued. Additionally, the name registered in your bank account must match the details on your PAN card. The refund will be credited to the bank account mentioned in your ITR. If the account details are incorrect, you will not receive the refund. Your refund can only be credited to a validated bank account. Check the bank account validation status on the e-filing portal with the following steps; Visit http://incometax.gov.in; E-verification of ITR E-verifying your income tax return is a mandatory step in the ITR filing process and essential for receiving a refund. You must complete the e-verification process within 30 days of filing your ITR. E-verifying within this timeframe will help expedite the processing of your refund. Outstanding Demand If you have any unresolved dues from the previous fiscal year, your income tax refund might experience delays. In such instances, your refund will be used to settle those outstanding dues. You will receive notification of this through an intimation notice. Return Under Scrutiny The Income Tax Department may select certain returns for scrutiny to verify accuracy and compliance. If your return is under scrutiny, your refund may be delayed until the assessment is complete. Mismatch in Form 26AS Form 26AS serves as a consolidated statement of all taxes paid against your PAN. If there is a disparity between the TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) details in your return and those in Form 26AS, it can result in a delay in receiving your refund. Technical Reasons Occasionally, refunds may be delayed due to technical issues like server problems or backlogs. In such instances, reaching out to the ITD helpline for further clarification is recommended. You can send an email to seek help. If the delay continues or if you encounter issues, it’s advisable to seek guidance from a tax professional or a chartered accountant."

Here, dark tales about a fabled temple have long kept people and development away. However, the modern world comes knocking at its door, when a mining corporation plans to set up a township to exploit a rare earth metal deposit below its revered temple. But for a town riddled with endless mysterious disappearances, unexpected possessions, and baffling suicides, locals staunchly believe in a myth that says that any threat to the temple will spell doom. Unfazed by the dark tales surrounding Shilaspura, an IAS officer sets out to redeem her career by resolving a conflict between a mining corporation and the local populace, led by the head of the temple. Burdened by explosive secrets, she has her fears to face, but that does not stop her from raging a war with a sacred Order. Can her quest to uncover the truth redeem Shilaspura’s fate and her life?

    "article_content": "Published By : Dishya Sharma Trending Desk Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 12:34 IST Delhi, India The actor recalled being stuck in the rom-com genre. (Image Credits: Instagram/officiallymcconaughey) Oscar-winning actor Matthew McConaughey has opened up about the time when he almost quit Hollywood. In a recent chat with Glen Powell for Interview Magazine, the actor spoke about how taking a break helped him reinvent himself in the industry. In the 2000s, McConaughey became a household name for starring in a series of romantic comedies. After a certain period, he felt like the work was no longer challenging, and thus he decided to take a two-year break. Noting that he felt trapped in the rom-com genre, the 54-year-old said, “I’ve usually zigged when I felt like Hollywood wanted me to zag. When I had my rom-com years, there was only so much bandwidth I could give to those, and those were some solid hits for me. But I wanted to try some other stuff. Of course, I wasn’t getting it, so I had to leave Hollywood.” Recalling the time, Matthew shared that it was “scary,” and he even had “long talks” about his career with his wife, Camila Alves McConaughey, considering other options like a high school teacher or a wildlife guide. “I honestly thought, ‘I stepped out of Hollywood. I got out of my lane.’ The lane Hollywood said I should stay in, and Hollywood’s like, ‘You should have stayed in your lane. Later,” he added. The actor explained how the days were “long” and brought him a sense of insignificance. However, he managed to convince himself to move forward and not quit the “mission.” “It was scary because I didn’t know if I was ever going to get out of the desert,” he continued. Despite the hesitation and fears, McConaughey’s absence ended up attracting calls for alternative roles, and he eventually made a return with dramatic roles in The Lincoln Lawyer, The Wolf of Wall Street and Dallas Buyers Club. He also won an Oscar for Best Actor for his performance as Ron Woodroof in the 2013 film. The film tells the story of Woodroof, a cowboy who was diagnosed with AIDS in the mid-1980s. Earlier in 2021, the actor described his Hollywood break as an “unbranding phase,” stating that he took a big risk at that time. “I had the last six months before I got that phone call to come back to work in dramas—I did not know if I was ever going to work in Hollywood again,” he said at the CogX conference."

    "article_content": "Published By : Dishya Sharma Trending Desk Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 13:21 IST Mumbai, India Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman will play lead roles in Deadpool & Wolverine. (Photo Credits: Instagram) Weeks before the highly-awaited MCU film hits theatres, Deadpool & Wolverine has received a final major update. Ryan Reynolds, who plays the lead role of Deadpool, took to social media and confirmed that the film’s post-production work has been completed. With its announcement in 2019, the return of Hugh Jackman as James ‘Logan’ Howlett’s Wolverine in 2022, and the official trailers uncovering a chaotic ride, Deadpool & Wolverine has truly come a long way. Fans have been equally excited and thrilled to watch the extraordinary bonding between the merc-with-a-mouth and his clawed best friend. On Wednesday, Reynolds took to his Instagram Stories and shared a BTS picture with director Shawn Levy. He wrote, “And that’s all she wrote for post-production. Feels like a million years of work went by in a blink. Sitting next to this guy made it all so sweet…Hard to walk away.\" While the picture suggests a hint of a goodbye, fans can only hope that this isn’t the final time Reynolds suits up as the wisecracking mercenary. Notably, the film comes at a time when Marvel Studios has been struggling to create an impact. Its latest releases, like She-Hulk and Thor: Love and Thunder, failed to work their charm, even facing backlash for poor VFX and uninteresting storylines. However, the response to Deadpool & Wolverine has been positive from the start, especially the trailers that have kept audiences hooked. One of the biggest bonus points of the film is Hugh Jackman’s return as Wolverine, after almost bidding adieu to his beloved character in the 2017 film Logan. Besides treating fans to a rollercoaster multiversal ride, it is also expected to reclaim the box office crown this year. More About Deadpool & Wolverine While Marvel Studios has kept tight-lipped about its upcoming movie, the trailers have left fans wondering what to expect next. There are Loki references, Avengers glimpses, and even interesting X-Men cameos, and it is not just the titular mutant. The makers are yet to release an official plot synopsis, but we do have some ideas. Going by the trailer, Wade Wilson will reunite with his friends for his birthday before being pulled by the Time Variance Authority. Seemingly back in time and maybe in another timeline, he is assigned a secretive mission to become “a hero among heroes.\" While Jackman’s Wolverine barely featured in the first trailer, he stands out more in the second one. He is back in the classic blue and yellow suit from Marvel Comics. The film is set for its theatrical release on July 26."

(Image Credits: Instagram/gigihadid) Gigi Hadid is presently on a vacation spree. The American supermodel has “been summering” with her 3-year-old daughter Khai at an undisclosed destination. She is accompanied by her friend and social media influencer Leah McCarthy. On Wednesday, June 19, Gigi Hadid shared a carousel of pictures and videos on Instagram, documenting her time spent at the location. Her holiday outing was marked with fun-filled sessions, fashionable escapades, basking in nature’s glory, and indulging in aquatic activities. Her new bob-cut wavy hairdo also caught the attention of many. “Been summering,” wrote Gigi Hadid. The first couple of snaps captured the 29-year-old posing under the sun in a strappy blue bikini, adorned with white flower prints. She paired the itty bitty number with denim shorts, accessorising her look with a multi-tiered golden necklace and a lettered black cap. Khai made an appearance in the following click, donning a floral-patterned navy blue monokini. Hadid unleashed her adventurous side as she took part in a wakeboarding activity, wading through the waters like an expert. Her friend Leah McCarthy was featured in the next slide standing at a cruise ship dock and dressed in a black bralette, identical pants, and a cap. A post shared by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) The picture carousel also offered viewers a glimpse of Gigi Hadid’s short, blonde hairdo. She made a chic style statement in a white ribbed tank top and a yellowish-white patterned skirt. Uber-cool black sunglasses completed her voguish OOTD. Hadid’s love for luxury brands was seen in the next slide which showcased a Chanel handbag in the blue shade, decorated with a printed scarf. In the last couple of photographs, Khai was seen running on a forested road, surrounded by lush greenery. She sat with her mother near a lake in the last photo. The kid’s rainbow-coloured stockings and purple shoes posed a striking contrast to Gigi’s black stockings and matching sneakers. Social media users were quick to react to the post. “How fast is time? Khai grows very well” pointed out a person. “Gorgeous. And Khai, she’s a grown kid already! Such a cutie and such a blessing seeing her growing through the years” quipped another. “Love the vibes,” commented an Instagrammer. Gigi Hadid welcomed Khai with her ex-partner and singer Zain Malik in September 2020. The two parted ways in 2021. Presently, Hadid is rumoured to be dating actor Bradley Cooper."

(Photo Credits: Instagram) Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are set to star in an unprecedented Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film featuring Deadpool & Wolverine. This upcoming action-packed movie, aiming for an R-rating, promises intense action, plenty of F-bombs, gory scenes, and other audacious elements. In an interview with Total Film, director Levy discussed the creative journey of Deadpool 3, highlighting initial discussions where the team decided against incorporating drug use into Phase Five of the MCU. Despite this constraint, the writing team toyed with the idea of mentioning drugs in dialogue, a concept that even made it into one of the film’s trailers. Levy explained, “I’m so wary of what I can say but certainly there were early conversations about overt drug use. We thought that was an interesting conversation. Let’s actually write a dialogue scene about having had it.” Interestingly, that particular line ended up in one of the trailers, where Deadpool talks to Blind Al, played by Leslie Uggams, about offering her some “Bolivian marching powder.” In the scene, Wade Wilson mentions cocaine, which is “the one thing (Marvel Studios head) Kevin (Feige) says is off the table.” Previously, Deadpool and Wolverine writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick explained that Disney supported their vision wholeheartedly. Speaking with Den of Geek, Reese said, “They’ve been very supportive. Now when it comes to a particular joke, if we cross a line, maybe we’ll hear at some point, ‘Maybe not that joke.’ But I think they’ve been incredibly supportive of what we’re doing, because obviously we were doing it separate from them for a long time, and I think they’ve seen the success and they’ve had their own even greater success. But we’ve definitely got their support, and that’s a great thing to feel.” Other than Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, the confirmed cast members for Deadpool 3 include Leslie Uggams, Emma Corrin, Morena Baccarin, Brianna Hildebrand, Matthew Macfadyen, Shioli Kutsuna, Karan Soni, Tara Strong, TJ Miller, Stefan Kapicic, Lewis Tan and Rob Delaney. The movie is scheduled to release on July 26."

(Image Credits: Instagram/emilia_clarke) Actress Emilia Clarke is a household name after her iconic role as Daenerys Targaryen in HBO’s wildly popular series Game of Thrones. The ‘Mother of Dragons’ recently shared her thoughts about the show’s prequel, House of the Dragon. Even though the series, currently in its second season, has received a lot of acclaim and has impressed many fans, Clarke has said that she is not able to watch it. In a conversation with PEOPLE, Clarke, 37, said that she is still reluctant to watch House Of The Dragon. The new series has just returned for its second season as of June 16. “I still can’t. I just don’t know what it is,” she admits. Talking about her experience in Game of Thrones, Clarke explained that her time on the show makes the idea of watching its prequel somewhat unsettling. “I feel so content and happy with what my experience was, that I think watching the new one would just feel so odd, I think,” said Clarke, who played Daenerys Targaryen, the wife of Khal Drogo, portrayed by actor Jason Momoa. Despite her reservations about watching House of the Dragon, Clarke added that she is fully supportive of the spinoff. She also expressed happiness for the show’s success, saying, “I really do fully support the entire thing and everyone who’s made it, and it’s beautiful how successful it’s been. It’s absolutely amazing.” Apart from her acting stints, the Me Before You star has recently taken on a new role as Pegasus Distillerie’s global brand ambassador. The first season of House of the Dragon premiered in August 2022. It is a prequel to Game of Thrones, which aired from 2011 to 2019. The new series deals with the events that lead to the fall of House Targaryen. It starts about a century after the Targaryen conquest united the Seven Kingdoms. This timeline sets the show nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones and 172 years before the birth of Clarke’s character, Daenerys. The key cast of House of the Dragon includes Paddy Considine, Matt Smith, Olivia Cooke, Emma D’Arcy, and Rhys Ifans. The first season of the series received critical acclaim and earned nominations for outstanding drama series at the 2024 Emmy Awards. It was also nominated at the Golden Globe Awards, the Critics’ Choice Television Award, and the SAG Awards. The first season consisted of 10 episodes, while the second season has eight episodes."

(Photo: Instagram) Musician Travis Scott was arrested and booked into Miami-Dade County Jail early Thursday morning on charges of trespassing property after being given a warning and disorderly intoxication, county jail records show. Scott, whose legal name is Jacques Bermon Webster, a hip-hop artist with hits like “Sikko Mode” and “Fe!N,” was arrested at 1:44 a.m. at the Miami Beach Marina and was booked into jail at 4:35 a.m., according to authorities and jail records. A $650 bond has been submitted for the 33-year-old, jail records show. Scott bonded out of jail at 8 a.m. Thursday, according to Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center in Miami-Dade County. CNN has reached out to representatives for Scott. Scott is one of the premiere rap artists of the last decade and is perhaps best known for his raucous live performances that have occasionally spun out of control, including a fatal Astroworld Festival show in 2021 that left 10 people dead. The incident early Thursday began when Scott was on a charter boat and was involved in a disturbance/dispute with the crew, police said. Officers were called to the marina, and he was asked to leave. Scott left and came back a second time and again got into a dispute with the crew and was asked to leave again, and after he refused, he was arrested, police said. The arrest affidavit offers some further details of the incident. According to the affidavit, police were called to the dock to respond to a report of people fighting on a yacht. Officers observed Scott yelling at the occupants, and officers could “sense a strong smell of alcohol” on his breath, the affidavit states. There was no physical altercation, a source close to Scott told CNN. Scott was told to leave or face arrest, and he then went to a vehicle and left the marina. He returned about five minutes later, disregarded officers’ commands not to go toward the yacht, and “began yelling once again, becoming erratic disturbing the peace,” and was taken into custody, the affidavit states. “The defendant later admitted that he had been drinking alcohol and stated, “‘It’s Miami,’” according to the affidavit. The affidavit further notes that 10 officers used body-worn cameras. Scott had the most musical success with his 2018 album “Astroworld” and the No. 1 hit single “Sicko Mode” featuring Drake, which sampled from a remarkable array of sources. The album was nominated for a Grammy for best rap album, and “Sicko Mode” was nominated for best rap song and best rap performance. Last year, he released “UTOPIA,” which was nominated for best rap album, his 10th Grammy nomination. In November 2021, Scott’s Astroworld Festival show turned into a mass casualty event, as 10 people were killed and 300 were injured during his set in Houston as a crowd of about 50,000 surged toward the stage. Scott was not charged with wrongdoing in connection with the crowd crush. He and other organizers faced 10 wrongful death lawsuits and had settled all of them as of last month, according to CNN affiliate KHOU. Scott has been arrested at least twice over incidents at his concerts. The first was during a 2015 Lollapalooza performance when police said Scott told attendees to climb over security barricades, according to CNN affiliate WLS. He later pleaded guilty to misdemeanour reckless conduct and was sentenced to one year of court supervision, the Chicago Tribune reported. In addition, in 2017 after a show in Rogers, Arkansas, he was charged with inciting a riot, disorderly conduct and endangering the welfare of a minor. Police said Scott “encouraged people to rush the stage and bypass the security protocols,” which resulted in injuries. Two of the charges were dismissed in 2018, but Scott pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and paid over $6,800 to two people who said they were injured at his show, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette reported. He shares two children with Kylie Jenner, the beauty mogul and the youngest sibling of the Kardashian-Jenner clan. This story has been updated with additional information. CNN’s Alisha Ebrahimji, Scottie Andrew and Denise Royal contributed to this report."

    "article_content": "Published By : Shrishti Negi Reuters Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 23:33 IST Mountain View, California, USA Donald Sutherland dead at 88, son Kiefer pays tribute. Donald Sutherland, one of Canada’s most versatile and gifted actors, who charmed and enthralled audiences in films such as “M*A*S*H,” “Klute,” “Ordinary People” and the “Hunger Games” films, has died at the age of 88. The Canadian actor, whose lengthy career spanned from the 1960s into the 2020s, died on Thursday, his son, actor Kiefer Sutherland, said on social media. The tall actor with a deep voice, piercing blue eyes and mischievous smile managed to switch effortlessly from character roles to romantic leads, opposite the likes of Jane Fonda and Julie Christie. He also played his share of oddballs and villains during a career that began in the 1960s. A post shared by Kiefer Sutherland (@kiefersutherland) One of the biggest stars in Hollywood in the 1970s, he remained in demand for film and TV projects into his 80s. Known for his unconventional looks and his versatility as an actor, Sutherland played a wide range of memorable characters. These included a rascally Army surgeon in “M*A*S*H” (1970), a quirky tank commander in “Kelly’s Heroes” (1970), a small-town detective in “Klute” (1971), a stoned and libidinous professor in “Animal House” (1978), a local official facing an alien presence in “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” (1978) and a despairing father in “Ordinary People” (1980). He won a new generation of fans with his glorious portrayal of a despotic president in “The Hunger Games” (2012) and its sequels. “I wish I could say thank you to all of the characters that I’ve played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life,” Sutherland said in his speech accepting an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 2017. Sutherland was born on July 17, 1935, in Canada’s New Brunswick province, and was raised in Nova Scotia. He performed in school productions in college, moved to Britain to hone his craft, then moved to the United States, where his first big break came as a member of a top-notch ensemble cast in the war film “The Dirty Dozen” (1967). He rocketed to fame three years later playing nonconformist surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in director Robert Altman’s Korean War satire “M*A*S*H” (1970). The film – later spun off into a TV series – depicted hijinks at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, tapping into the anti-war sentiment among many Americans during the Vietnam War era. Also in 1970, Sutherland starred alongside Telly Savalas and Clint Eastwood in “Kelly’s Heroes” as Sergeant Oddball on a mission to steal gold from the Nazis. The following year, he was paired with Fonda, one of Hollywood’s luminaries, in “Klute,” and then in 1973 played a grieving father in “Don’t Look Now” that included a sizzling sex scene with Christie. “Klute” sparked a romance with Fonda, with whom he was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement. His 1978 films could not have been more different. In the uproarious comedy “Animal House,” Sutherland played a professor who sleeps with the girlfriend of a fraternity member. “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” was a successful sci-fi remake of a classic 1956 original, telling the story of alien pods that take over human beings. Sutherland’s performance in “Ordinary People,” Hollywood superstar Robert Redford’s directorial debut, helped the 1980 film win four Academy Awards including best picture. Sutherland starred alongside Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton in this exploration of the splintering of a Midwestern family. In the 1990s he appeared in films including “JFK” (1991), “Backdraft” (1991), “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” (1992), “Outbreak” (1995), “A Time To Kill” (1996) and “Instinct” (1999) and won an Emmy Award for his performance in the 1995 HBO TV movie “Citizen X.” In the 2000s, he appeared in the acclaimed “Cold Mountain” (2003) and “Pride & Prejudice” (2005). In the “Hunger Games” films in the 2010s about a dystopian future in which teenagers are sent into a deadly competition as mass entertainment, he reveled in playing the villainous President Coriolanus Snow. “The reality was he had a country to run. At least he was running it, which is more than you can say for some people,” Sutherland told the Los Angeles Times in 2017. “It was funny at the beginning with ‘The Hunger Games’ to walk through an airport and suddenly you feel this tug and you look down and it’s some young person – always a girl, never a boy,” Sutherland said. “And her mother is standing there and they say, ‘Could you take a photograph with my daughter?’ And we’d be standing beside each other and I’d be looking at the camera and the girl would say, ‘Could you look mean?'” Sutherland was considered among the best actors to never receive an Academy Award nomination for any of his roles. He was married three times and had five children, including Kiefer."

    "article_content": "Published By : Shrishti Negi CNN Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 03:40 IST Mountain View, California, USA Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck tied the knot in July 2022. Ben Affleck is well aware of what people say about some of his expressions. The Oscar-winner appears in a new episode of Peacock’s “Hart to Heart,” hosted by Kevin Hart, where he discussed why he’s been frequently photographed appearing in a sour mood. “First of all, I’m also a little bit shy. I also don’t like a lot of attention,” Aflleck told Hart. “It’s [like] why people see me and they’re like, what’s with this dude? Always mad. He’s always mad, because when somebody has their camera and it’s sticking in my face and I’m like, okay.” Affleck said he’s even more bothered by paparazzo cameras when he is with his kids. “I may be angry that you’re around my children. I don’t mind you taking my picture. Coming out of a club or premiere [or] whatever. Go ahead. Knock yourself out,” Affleck said. “I don’t notice you. But with my children, that’s a different thing.” When Hart suggested he has “resting b*tch face,” Affleck clarified that he likes to think of it as “resting hard face.” “I’ve noticed this. I’m like, people are projecting something onto me that I don’t feel about myself at all,” Affleck explained. “Whether it’s a certain look or, I don’t know, role or something… For a long time they’d be like, this guy’s a frat guy. I’ve never been in a fraternity one day in my life! Never once been inside of a frat house, nothing against it. How can I have anything against it? I’ve never been there. But I dunno why you are all saying I’m a frat guy either. What does that mean? I’m like, I didn’t go to college.” Affleck also spoke about what it’s like to be married to Hollywood icon Jennifer Lopez. “We went somewhere with [Lopez]—I can’t remember because she’s so famous, and she creates this—people love her, and she really represents something important to people,” Affleck says. “[To me,] people are like, ‘Hey, I like your movie,’ and then they’re like ‘AAAHHHH! J-LO!,’” he yelled. “It’s amazing, you know what I mean?” Hart and Affleck filmed their conversation in January. “Hart to Heart” is streaming now on Peacock."

(Photo Credit: YouTube) Dakota Johnson faced a wardrobe malfunction while attending an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live. On June 19, the Madame Web actress marked her presence at the popular celebrity chat show for the promotions of her upcoming film Daddio. Directed by Christy Hall, the American drama also stars Sean Paul in the lead. The film is slated to hit the silver screens on June 28. Mid-interview with television host Jimmy Kimmel, Dakota Johnson’s dress “fell off” as one of the straps on the dress broke. But, the actress who encountered similar situations in the past, handled the matter with sheer confidence. The incident occurred when Jimmy Kimmel was showing the audience a clip from Daddio, reported People. During the session, Dakota Johnson was seen struggling with the straps of her ensemble. She donned a black slip dress featuring metallic straps, adorned with floral embellishments. One of the straps appeared to be broken leading Johnson to hold her outfit in place, lest the dress came off. Noticing the actress adjusting the straps, a concerned Kimmel asked, “Part of your dress just came unhooked. You all right?” The actress dealt with the malfunction quite maturely and replied, “My dress just, it just fell off. Well, I’ll just hold it,” with a laugh. https://www.youtube.com/watch Jimmy Kimmel joked that Dakota Johnson needed to “hold the important part” of her dress which prompted the actress to place her hands over her chest to keep the bodice in place. Holding that pose, Johnson joked, “The movie (Daddio) is really good,” seemingly taking the circumstance light-heartedly. Like an expert, she was able to hold the straps together throughout the interaction. Unfazed, she answered all the questions related to her yet-to-be-released film. A post shared by Sony Pictures Classics (@sonyclassics) This is not the first time that Dakota Johnson encountered a wardrobe mishap. Previously while accepting an award at the 2016 People’s Choice Awards for the favorite dramatic movie actress category, she experienced an identical situation. While sharing a hug with presenter Leslie Mann, Johnson’s Armani Privé Couture crop top came undone while on stage. “Leslie just broke my dress. Well, it’s not like nobody here hasn’t already seen my boobs,” she said jokingly, presumably indicating her intimate scenes with co-star Jamie Dornan in the Fifty Shades film franchise."

Timberlake had told police he “had one martini and followed my friends home,” according to court records. A Sag Harbor Village Police Department officer described him as “unable to divide attention,” adding “he had slowed speech, he was unsteady afoot and he performed poorly on all standardized field sobriety tests.” Timberlake rejected a chemical test three times. He was placed under arrest and held overnight for arraignment, according to police. He was released without bail and his next court appearance is scheduled for July 26.

Priyanka Chopra is truly sweating it out on the sets of her upcoming film, The Bluff. The actress is currently in Australia and has been updating fans with photos and videos from the sets, showing fans glimpses of her “life lately”. Maintaining that trajectory, Priyanka shared yet another reel featuring her daughter Malti and moments spent with her loved ones. The clip featured Malti Marie, her mother Madhu Chopra, her manager’s son and other near and dear ones. However, PeeCee marked Nick Jonas’s absence with a sweet line in the post. She penned the caption, “My angel baby, my best friend, my godson, my brother from another mother and my actual mother. Nothing like family and friends to keep you rejuvenated . Miss you gaga @nickjonas . Can’t wait til you’re here..#thebluff ‍☠️ #homeiswheretheheartis #workingmom.” Take a look: A post shared by Priyanka (@priyankachopra) After revealing the injuries she sustained during an action sequence, Priyanka Chopra also recently shared another reel. The video captures her busy schedule, including moments between makeup sessions, preparations, physiotherapy and heartwarming interactions with her daughter, Malti Marie. On Saturday, the Love Again star took to Instagram and shared the video with the caption, “Previously… on #thebluff #stunts #actionaddict #workingsaturday.” In the video, one can see Priyanka working with her makeup team on fake injury marks and her look for the film, followed by glimpses of injuries on her arm and face and moments with her co-stars. In between, one can also spot little Malti on the sets, holding her mother’s hands, having dinner with her and enjoying music during the breaks. While Priyanka looks quite exhausted and drained, considering the high-octane action scenes and her busy schedule, the little munchkin is equally adorable. Earlier, the actress shared a carousel of pictures along with a video of herself with messy hair and a blood-soaked face, along with injury marks below her neck. “Yeah. When you do action movies, it is really glamorous. Another day at the office,” she says in the video. The post also included pictures of her daughter, her friends and the crew members of The Bluff. While the injuries and blood in her current film are staged, Priyanka Chopra had previously sustained a real injury resulting in a scar on her neck. She shared a picture on Instagram and captioned, “Professional hazards at my job.” Directed by Frank E Flower, The Bluff follows the story of a former female pirate (Priyanka), who must protect her family while struggling with her mysterious past. The film also features Karl Urban, Ismael Cruz Cordova, Safia Oakley-Green and Vedanten Naidoo in significant roles. After last year’s global franchise Citadel, The Bluff marks Priyanka’s second collaboration with Amazon MGM Studios and AGBO. On the other hand, the actress is yet to make her Bollywood comeback. Last seen in the 2019 film The Sky Is Pink, she is expected to feature in Farhan Akhtar’s Jee Le Zaraa. Besides, she also has Heads of State alongside Idris Elba and John Cena."

Prince William kicked off his birthday celebrations in style by showing off his dance moves to Taylor Swift’s catchy hit, ‘Shake It Off,’ at the opening night of the Eras Tour in London. The 42-year-old royal was spotted enjoying the sold-out Friday concert at Wembley Stadium in the company of his two oldest children, 10-year-old Prince George and 9-year-old Princess Charlotte. The Prince of Wales was captured on video appearing to be in high spirits as he danced energetically to Taylor Swift’s performance of ‘Shake It Off’ during the four-hour set. Online videos of the royal’s dance moves quickly circulated, showcasing his enthusiasm for the hit song. Adding to the excitement, the royal trio took a selfie with Swift and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, which later made its way to the singer’s Instagram account. Prior to the concert, in a delightful gesture, the royal guard band entertained the crowd with a rendition of ‘Shake It Off’ in front of Buckingham Palace as a warm welcome for the 34-year-old pop star’s arrival in London. Prince William dancing to Taylor Swift’s ‘Shake It Off’ at the Eras Tour in London. pic.twitter.com/yBzm8mbULF — Pop Base (@PopBase) June 22, 2024 A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) William has had some memorable encounters with the talented musician in the past. Back in 2013, a special moment unfolded when William, together with Swift and Jon Bon Jovi, took the stage to deliver an unforgettable rendition of ‘Livin’ on a Prayer’ at a Centrepoint charity event held at Kensington Palace. Reflecting on this star-studded experience in a recent episode of Apple Fitness+’s Time to Walk series in 2021, William shared, “I went to a charity fundraising gala for Centrepoint, which is a young homeless charity that I am very fond of and have supported for many years. It’s an annual fundraiser, and I turn up, and Jon Bon Jovi and Taylor Swift are at the event, which nearly knocked me off my feet as well.” Recalling the moment when he thought his evening couldn’t get any better after watching Bon Jovi perform, William expressed, “When I sat down to watch Jon Bon Jovi do his performance, I thought, ‘That’s it. My job is done. I’ll get a dinner in a minute, and I might be able to have a chat to some people, and, you know, I’m off-duty a little bit now.’ Little did I think what was going to happen next.” Seated beside Taylor Swift, with her on his left, William described the unexpected turn of events, saying, “She’s on my left. And after Jon does his first song, there’s a pause and she turns to me. She puts her hand on my arm, looks me in the eye, and says, ‘Come on, William. Let’s go and sing.’” Prince William and his children’s fun evening at the Eras Tour happened just days after their attendance at the Trooping the Color festivities, a significant event commemorating King Charles III’s traditional birthday celebration. The gathering also marked the first official public appearance for Kate, the Princess of Wales, since Christmas Day 2023. Amidst this busy schedule of royal events, it’s important to note that the devoted mother of three is courageously navigating a personal health journey. Following an abdominal surgery earlier this year, Kate is currently undergoing a round of “preventative” chemotherapy, showcasing her resilience and determination in the face of challenges."

In videos surfacing from the discharge ceremony, Jin was seen wiping his tears as he prepared to leave the military camp. To top it off, his fellow BTS members were present to welcome him back.

BTS’ agency, BigHit Music had requested fans not to gather outside the military camp that Jin would be discharged from to avoid any inconvenience."

    "article_content": "Published By : Dishya Sharma Trending Desk Last Updated: June 12, 2024, 16:15 IST Mumbai, India South Korea retaliated against this move. (Photo Credits: X) At the closely guarded border between North and South Korea, the rivals who haven’t had any meaningful negotiations in years—the odd, cold war-style tactics continue day after day. North Korea has been launching hundreds of balloons carrying garbage and even excrement towards South Korea since last month. In response, South Korea resumed what is known as a propaganda broadcast. On June 9, KST, South Korea re-deployed massive loudspeakers along the border with the North to broadcast anti-North Korean propaganda. As per South Korean media reports, the broadcast featured BTS’ smash songs Butter and Dynamite. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s sister, Kim Yo-jong, expressed her disapproval of the propaganda programme by saying that it might potentially lead to a “crisis of confrontation.” South Korean media outlet Koreaboo quoted her as saying, “This is a prelude to a very dangerous situation.” Professor Leif-Eric Easley of Seoul’s Ewha University told ABC News that both Koreas are currently attempting to exert pressure and dissuade one another by “politically symbolic actions.” Easley stated that tensions at the border run the risk of escalating into unintentional war since no party wants to be perceived as giving up. As for South Korea, its decision to redeploy the large speaker on Sunday can be interpreted as a return of its anti-Pyongyang propaganda broadcasts. Along with BTS songs, they reportedly broadcasted news on Samsung, the largest South Korean firm, weather predictions and external criticism of the North’s missile programme and its censorship of outside media. The event, according to the Washington Times, took place in Seoul’s picturesque neighbourhood of Buahm Dong, which is enclosed by mountains. Less than one mile separates Buam Dong from Gwanghwamun, Seoul’s busy city centre and the location of the US Embassy and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the other hand, this past weekend saw the beginning of North Korea’s “filth balloon” onslaught. Up to 330 are claimed to have launched, but only 80 have been reported to have landed in the South due to shifting wind patterns. The bombardment appears to be a reaction to balloons that South Korean activists, some of whom are defectors from North Korea, sent into the North. In order to entice North Korean residents to pick them up, the balloons are laden with anti-regime propaganda and USB drives are filled with K-pop songs, used toilet paper, K-dramas and occasionally, US currency. Even though the southern balloons were allegedly launched by private-sector entities rather than the government, Seoul “formally” entered the retaliatory arena this week. The primary Chosun Ilbo daily said that the military broadcasts, known as Voice of Freedom, opened with the South’s national anthem and a clarification of why Seoul was resuming its propaganda operations. The Comprehensive Military Agreement (CMA), a bilateral mechanism for reducing tension, was signed in 2018 amid an easing of cross-border tensions and a pro-engagement government in Seoul. Both sides have since accused each other of violating CMA guidelines and Seoul’s National Security Council then announced the agreement’s official suspension."

(Photo credits: Instagram) On June 12, 2024, BTS star Jin, the eldest member of the renowned Korean boy group, completed his mandatory military service. Jin, aged 31, was the first among his bandmates to enlist in the South Korean Army in December 2022, serving for 18 months. While fans worldwide eagerly celebrated his return, Jin, along with his team, had diligently prepared for his upcoming engagements and events. To reconnect with his fans, Jin hosted a live session on Weverse. This session was extra special as it was also the first time in about two years that fans had the opportunity to hear directly from Jin. During the live broadcast, Jin reportedly talked about his experiences while serving in the military as well as how he felt after getting discharged. He also discussed his plans for the future, especially regarding the upcoming FESTA 2024 event. FESTA is an annual event that celebrates BTS’s debut anniversary. During his Weverse live, Jin also revealed details of the “free hug event” he plans to host during this year’s FESTA. He explained that he would be offering hugs to 1,000 lucky fans. “I need to talk about FESTA. I gave a good idea, but it received a lot of criticism. I took a look at it so let me try to explain. I took a draft with me from the start. Since I am in charge of the FESTA by myself this time, I contacted the organizer around October, November last year. But they were honest and said they already planned everything so there wasn’t much left to do. They asked me if I had any ideas. I said I wanted to do a free hug event, but they said no,” he explained as reported by Koreaboo. Jin further said that the organisers were initially worried about the safety concerns related to such an event. However, they have now agreed to a free hug event that would be limited to 1,000 fans only. “After that, I don’t think I paid much attention to it. I am sorry. The company and I prepared this event with good intentions. It became like this because I really wanted to hug many fans. I hope you can accept this with your hearts,” added Jin. He also expressed that his decision to hold the hug event should not put any pressure or expectations on the other BTS members. “The hug event was my idea, and I don’t think the other members will do it. I did it because I wanted to. I hope this situation won’t be passed on to the other members. I don’t want people to say, ‘Jin did it, why aren’t they doing it.’ I hope no one makes this about, ‘so-and-so did it, what about them,” he said, as quoted by Koreaboo."

(Photo credits: Instagram) Korean boy band BTS marked its 11th debut anniversary on June 13. The BTS ARMY across the globe is busy celebrating and showering love on their favourite band during the annual FESTA event. Meanwhile, despite being busy in their compulsory military services, even the members have left no stone unturned to express their gratitude and excitement to fans. BTS members have also shared some special handwritten letters addressing their fans. While all of them have thanked the ARMY, expressed feeling emotional and promised to meet them soon, it is Jungkook’s letter in particular that has moved everyone to tears. The BTS maknae (youngest member), Jungkook, wrote a letter that has touched the hearts of millions of his fans. 페스타에 뜬 정구기 손편지래요ㅠㅠ🥹💜🐰안녕하십니까 정국입니다 손 편지는 너무 오랜만에 쓰는 것 같은데 필체가 더 안좋아진 것 같습니다 죄송합니다ㅋㅋ 여러분!! 저는 잘 지내고 있습니다 물론 힘든 부분이 없진 않지만 여러분들을 다시 만날 날만 생각하며 잘 버티는 중이고 가끔은 힘들다는… pic.twitter.com/L1xQyaDzW6 — (slow~)꾹이모나 🐰2025🗓️🔜 (@JJUNGKOOK_mona) June 13, 2024 Jungkook started by apologising for his handwriting, acknowledging that it had deteriorated due to not having written a letter in a long time. He reassured the ARMY that he has been doing well but also admitted facing a few challenges. “Of course, there are some difficult moments, but I am pulling through as I think of the day I can meet you all again. Some moments are so fun that I forget that I am having a hard time,” he wrote, reports Koreaboo. Jungkook also went on to ask his fans if they had listened to his song Never Let Go. “As soon as I heard it, I wanted it to be a fan song. I also wanted to show performance, but I didn’t have a lot of time, so I wasn’t able to make that happen. Later, if I have the opportunity, I’d like to show you on stage. I want to do more cool songs. It was so cold, and summer hasn’t officially started yet, but I already want it to be winter again,” Jungkook explained. The SEVEN singer further said that his time seems to pass very slowly because he misses his fans. He concluded his letter by saying, “I guess it’s because I miss you all so much. If I just enjoy this time, I will be in front of you guys in no time, right? Hwaiting! Anyway, until we meet again, don’t be sick and take care of your health, so we will be even more happy when we meet again. I miss you all so much and I really, really, really love you all. Man, I really can’t write letters, haha. I’ll be off now. Bye,” informs Koreaboo. Jungkook’s letter struck a chord with ARMYs, leaving many fans emotional and unable to hold back their tears.

Last year, after pushing and postponing my plans of enlisting with Hoseokie in April, I held hands with the younger members and we headed in together. And so 2023 went by, spent entirely with alcohol and work. I am jealous of my buddy’s sergeant patch but well.. I have no regrets. (hehe;) I think this is the first time I’ve released something and not been able to talk about things directly with you. I have a lot to say but it’s all been written into the album so.. the album is purely the product of my fight with myself to become more honest. I hope that you keep reading it, over and over, for a long long time. It is a sincere, heartfelt wish. Three days ago, Jin hyung was finally discharged. I brought along my saxophone and played it to be funny but honestly, I had a lot of complicated emotions running through me. Being the first to go was probably really lonely and difficult.. What was it like? That one year and six months treats everyone here equally. Now, we are probably living hyung’s past. Out in the world for the first time in a while, I realised that time outside really does flow differently. Gravity feels different too.. everyone’s been living their lives regardless of my absence, doing well, flowing along nicely. I felt a little empty but, more than anything else, it felt great to get together with the members after a really long time and have a heart-to-heart over drinks (though more than half the conversation consisted of military stories.. haha). It had been nearly 10 whole months since we did something like this. Why did I miss these guys so much.. I did call them sometimes, randomly, asking them how they were doing. Jin hyung did always tell us that he missed the other members a lot, that we were going to feel the same. Now scattered apart, living somewhere in Gangwondo, I understand it, it resonates so deeply. Actually talking face-to-face, I was reminded of the things that remain unchanging, the place that I have to return to, the person that I was.. it was a meaningful, precious time for all of us. Where else will we be wandering? What expressions will we wear on our faces next year, on our twelfth anniversary? Missing you makes me picture you, and by picturing you I miss you more. We’re already in our eleventh year. All we have to do is just count one more. I entrust the future to Jin hyung and Hobi, who have been and will be the first to be embraced in your arms. I’m taking back with me the realisation that there are still lots of people who haven’t forgotten about us, who are waiting for us. An outpouring of love. As always, I’ll try doing fine, day by day, thinking of you guys and the members. I love you. Thank you. Until early summer next year, Namjoon RM is set to discharge next year."

(Photo Credits: Instagram) TWICE’s Hirai Momo and Super Junior’s Kim Heechul left the K-pop world heartbroken after they officially parted ways in 2021. While the couple never disclosed the exact reason for their breakup, they cited busy schedules. Recently, Heechul fans’ were disappointed when the topic of his ex-girlfriend came up on the Korean reality show Knowing Bros. Guests on the show, including Kim Young Chul, Lee Jeong Eun, Choi Jin Hyuk, and Jung Eunji, were discussing Kim Young Chul’s daily life when Heechul expressed curiosity about living like him. However, it was Kim Young Chul’s comment that sparked controversy. He remarked that he wanted to live like Heechul and jokingly made references to Heechul’s history of dating girl group members, including Momo. As per Korea Boo, Heechul said, “I am very curious about what it would be like to live as Kim Young Chul. He’s smart and can speak several languages.” Reacting to this, Kim Young Chul added, “I want to live like Heechul. He dates girl group members and kisses them while hanging out with them until 3-4 AM.” Fans of Momo and Kim Heechul reportedly felt uncomfortable with Knowing Bros for repeatedly bringing up their past relationship. According to Sports Kyunghyang, k-pop fans accused the show’s producers of failing to remove the segment, while others urged Heechul and his friends to refrain from making such jokes in public. Meanwhile, this isn’t the first time Heechul mentioned his past relationship with Momo. Earlier, not once but on several occasions since the couple broke up, Heechul spoke about her, leading fans to feel that the Super Junior member should move forward in life. Kim Heechul made his singing debut in 2005 and has since appeared on several reality shows, including My Little Old Boy and Delicious Rendezvous. He has also hosted shows such as Knowing Bros and Weekly Idol in the past. On the other hand, Momo, who began her career with Twice in 2015, has been their lead dancer. Heechul and Momo, who started dating in 2020, remained in the public eye for various reasons. The Super Junior star frequently shared pictures with Momo on Instagram and showed his support by attending her group’s concerts."

    "article_content": "Published By : Dishya Sharma Trending Desk Last Updated: June 17, 2024, 17:15 IST Mumbai, India EXO’s leader Suho said he was “shocked and disappointed” with the rift. (Photo Credits: Instagram) The ongoing dispute between popular boy band EXO-CBX’s members Byun Baekhyun, Kim Min-Seok (A.K.A. Xiumin) and Kim Jong-Dae (A.K.A. Chen) with their former agency, SM Entertainment has been making waves in the K-pop world. However, amidst the flurry of headlines and speculations, the leader of EXO, Suho has stepped forward to shed light on the situation. As per a report in Koreaboo, Suho revealed that he learned about the feud through new reports, leaving him both shocked and disappointed. “The other members and myself found out about the press conference and their feud through news reports. We were shocked and really disappointed. EXO fans were hurt from something similar last year and therefore I wanted to tell the fans how sorry I was,” Suho said. On June 10, 2024, INB100 made headlines after announcing a press conference to unveil to what they termed as unfair practices by SM Entertainment. Baekhyun’s label INB100 manages EXO members’ activities per agreement terms. The trio announced their decision to take legal action against SM Entertainment. They have accused the agency of “abuse of superior bargaining position.” At a press conference earlier this month, Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin expressed their disappointment claiming that SM Entertainment had allegedly failed to uphold their end of the agreement by not honouring their 5.5 per cent music distribution fee for INB100. They also criticised SM’s purported demand for 10 per cent of their individual earrings. In a swift rebuttal, SM Entertainment countered the allegations asserting that the members terminated their exclusive contracts prematurely. The agency further revealed that the agreement had been reached wherein they would pay 10 per cent of their earnings to the agency. SM clarified that there was no prior agreement specifying a music distribution fee. Despite EXO’s efforts to negotiate a more favourable arrangement, SM Entertainment took the decisive step of filing a lawsuit against them on June 12. Following SM’s legal action, EXO wasted no time in announcing its legal action against the agency the following day. In their official statement, EXO outlined their primary objectives for initiating legal proceedings against SM Entertainment. Their focus was on ensuring fair profit distribution and transparency to expose what they deemed as flaws in SM Entertainment’s profit-sharing practices. Meanwhile, Suho also updated fans regarding the highly anticipated album featuring all EXO members. “SM Entertainment was planning on a winter album and an album featuring all of the members once Kai and Sehoon returned from the military. I hope that it still happens so that we can repay fans with music. I am concerned, however, as I am not the decision-maker,” he said."

(Photo Credits: Instagram) The life of a global superstar is filled with appreciation and memorable moments, but it also comes with some added responsibilities and challenges we might not be aware of. RM, the leader of the popular K-pop boyband BTS, has been experiencing major changes in his life since he enlisted for his mandatory military service in the South Korean military. It has almost been six months since he began serving in the Army. Recently, he took to Weverse and shared some insights about this phase of his life. Reflecting on his time so far, RM shared that he has been busy with his duties, to the point where he couldn’t even mark the 11th anniversary of BTS on social media. “It was [BTS’] 11th anniversary not long ago, but I couldn’t leave even a short post because I was busy. Comeback To Me (his song) came out a month ago, and RPWP came out three weeks ago. Last April, I postponed my plan to enlist with [J-Hope] and ended up joining hands with my younger siblings. I think I spent the last 23 years just drinking and working. I’m jealous of my friend’s sergeant’s badge but I have no regrets. (lol),” he said, reports Billboard. In his post, RM also talked about not being able to share his thoughts in person. He explained that his recent album is an honest portrayal of his thoughts and struggles. He urged his fans to listen to it on repeat to understand it better. “This is my first work where I haven’t been able to share my thoughts in person. There’s a lot I want to say, but it’s all written in the album… This is just an album in which I struggled to be honest with myself. I hope you read it over and over again for a long time,” he reportedly added. In a very emotional and heartfelt part of his post, he also mentioned his fellow BTS member Jin. Jin has just completed his military service last week. All the BTS members had reunited to welcome Jin back. RM had even played a saxophone to their hit song Dynamite. Further into his Weaverse post, RM said that he could feel how lonely and difficult it must have been for Jin to be the first to serve. “I brought a saxophone to play for fun, but in reality, I had mixed feelings. I wonder if it would have been very lonely and difficult to go first.. what would it have been like? One year and six months is fair to everyone here,” he added, as reported by Billboard. The BTS leader also expressed his longing for his bandmates. “Jin always used to talk about it. I miss the members so much. I bet you do too. Now that I am scattered and living somewhere in Gangwon-do, I understand deeply. When we actually talked face to face, I realised again the things that never change, the place I had to return to, and what kind of person I was… It was a meaningful and precious time for all of us.” All BTS members are expected to reunite in June 2025."

Just days ahead of the Bigg Boss 17 grand finale, Munawar was speaking to Ankita Lokhande when he made shocking claims and stated that on Diwali night, Mannara kissed him. He gestured to kiss with his hand on his cheeks, implying that Mannara kissed him. When Ankita argued that she did not see it, Munawar told her that he never told to anyone. “I got uncomfortable because I have always maintained a line,” Munawar had said as quoted by Pinkvilla. Later, Mannara reacted to his kiss allegation and demanded a public apology. “Oh my god! It’s a weird statement. There’s no footage like this. I don’t know in what context he said that, but if he has, he needs to apologise to me publically,” she told E-Times. Meanwhile, Munawar reportedly married Mehzabeen on May 26, 2024. It was said to be a close-knit affair which only their family members attended. Previously, the first photos of the couple surfaced on social media in which they were seen cutting a cake together. Munawar sported a white shirt with brown pants. On the other hand, Mehzabeen looked prettiest in a purple sharara suit. It was said that the picture was from their secret wedding."

    "article_content": "Published By : Chirag Sehgal PTI Last Updated: June 11, 2024, 21:24 IST Mumbai, India Raghubir Yadav acknowledges the enormous success of Panchayat but is also wary of making too much of it in case it affects his performance. (Photo: Instagram) Almost four decades after his first film, more since his debut on stage and numerous small screen appearances later, veteran actor Raghubir Yadav says “Panchayat” has taken his success to the next level with people recognising him as “Pradhan ji” wherever he goes. “As if what I have done in the past is forgotten. I am Pradhan ji,” Yadav, one of the most prominent faces of the parallel cinema and theatre movement whose career arc spans decades and mediums, told PTI. The adulation after “Panchayat”, which revolves around the everyday struggles of people in an Uttar Pradesh village and is currently in its third season, also worries him. The show has reintroduced him to audiences as the beloved and a little befuddled Pradhan ji, always looking to improve the lives of the people of his village. “Everywhere I go, people call me Pradhan ji. Right now, I am shooting in Varanasi and people are wondering what is Pradhan ji doing amongst us,” he said in the phone interview from Varanasi. The 66-year-old acknowledges the enormous success of the OTT show but is also wary of making too much of it in case it affects his performance. “I will take it in only after there are no more seasons left. Right now, I just worry about the quality of the show. I don’t want to be too happy or sad,” he said. “The characters shown in the series were the kind of people I grew up with or met them during my Parsi theatre days. There was a simplicity and ease to life that is still inherent in our villages. That’s what the series has managed to translate without much artifice,” Yadav added. He grew up in one such village in Madhya Pradesh’s Jabalpur district. Raghubir didn’t even have a school but was steeped in melody. He would sing film songs in local functions and perform bhajans in the temple built by his maternal grandfather. And that’s how he started dreaming of a career in music. “Sometimes your wishes pave the way for you. I joined a Parsi theatre company run by (actor) Annu Kapoor’s father and worked there for six years. I would get Rs 2.50 daily and I count it among my best days. I would often go hungry but it taught me so much. Thodi takleef na ho to maza nahi aata,” he said. From the Parsi theatre in Madhya Pradesh, Yadav went on to study in Delhi’s National School of Drama where he stayed for 13 years as part of the repertory company, honing his talents as an actor and also singer. “Since childhood, I don’t get too happy or sad about things. What people call a struggle, I believe is just motivation to work hard,” he said. Recalling his student years in NSD, where “Panchayat” co-star Neena Gupta was his junior, Yadav recalled that Ebrahim Alkazi, then director of the drama school, asked him to choose his specialisation and he responded by saying he wanted to learn everything. “And that’s how I came into stagecraft. All the students warned me that you will have to labour a lot but I went ahead with it. It has helped me a lot in acting. I never need any cues or the mark. I know where to stand, when to stop and how much distance there should be between co-actors while performing. I have a small workshop at home and when I am not doing anything, I craft little things like flutes and stuff. I also sometimes pick up the broom and clean the house or get into the kitchen. I find it therapeutic,” he added. Gupta, who plays his on-screen wife Manju Devi in “Panchayat”, recently posted a picture of their youth which was circulated widely. Yadav said it feels surreal that their life has brought them to this moment. “We did many plays together and while working on the show we realised we have travelled such a long distance and still are like family to each other. That’s how we behave when we are working on the show. This is a picture from when she was in NSD and I was in the repertory. That photo made us realise the journey we have had. That experience now reflects on our faces,” he said. Acting, said the Mumbai-based artiste who first came to notice with “Massey Sahib” and the Doordarshan serial “Mungeri Lal Ke Haseen Sapne”, is a constant process of learning. “The field of arts and culture is like an ocean. You can never have enough. If I am honest, I feel one lifetime is too short for it. There is so much to do for everyone. I feel I should learn the best I can and maybe I can excel in my next life because one life is not enough,” he said. From playing Mungerilal, the day-dreaming protagonist of “Mungerilal…” to Pradhanji in “Panchayat”, it has been an interesting journey. The film debut came with Pradip Krishen’s “Massey Sahib”. And it has been quality over quantity for him ever since. Yadav has also featured in acclaimed films such as “Salaam Bombay!”, “Suraj Ka Satvan Ghoda”, “Dharavi”, “Maya Memsaab”, “Bandit Queen” and “Saaz”. Then there were commercial outings, including “Dil Se..”, “Lagaan”, “Dilli 6”, “Peepli Live” or “Piku”, “Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar” and the latest “Kathal”. His television outings have been equally impressive whether it was “Mungerilal Ke Haseen Sapne” or the Chacha Chowdhary of the beloved comic book adaptation. That’s not counting his theatre years and the music work that he has done over the years. Not all the film roles were to his liking. It was challenging to say no to movies that were of inferior quality but came with attractive pay cheques, he said. However, he always felt he should stay true to his craft, he said. “I always feel that I shouldn’t be doing something that does not feel right. You may earn money in the short term but what will you do after that. I come from theatre and understand the joy that comes from playing varied characters. In the other kind of work, you are playing the same character with different outfits after a point,” he said. Yadav was always invested in theatre, but the pandemic changed things for some time. Now that things are back to normal, he has planned not one but three stage shows in Delhi. He is bringing back “Piano”, a Hindi adaptation of a Hungarian drama penned by Ferenc Karinthy, and then there is “Sanam Doob Gaye”. He is also adapting Hindi literature great Fanishwar Nath Renu’s famous story “Maare Gaye Gulfam” for a play. “This is from Renuji’s story. I have also given music for it. Because I belong to the Parsi theatre, I have brought those elements in it. I have adapted it in my own way,” he said."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Yatamanyu Narain News18.com Last Updated: June 15, 2024, 19:37 IST Mumbai, India Aasif Khan recalls he was denied entry to Kareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan's wedding. Actor Aasif Khan made a heartfelt return to the popular series Panchayat for its third season, much to the joy of his fans. Interestingly, he shared a fascinating anecdote about the time he was working as a waiter and had a missed opportunity to attend Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor’s lavish wedding. Despite being in the same vicinity as the glamorous event, he was unfortunately denied the chance to meet the star couple. Reflecting on his journey in a recent interview with ABP Uncut, Aasif discussed his rise to fame in the world of OTT platforms and reminisced about his humble beginnings washing dishes in the same hotel where the grand wedding took place. When reflecting on that particular moment, the actor expressed a poignant sentiment about seeking permission from his manager to meet the Bollywood stars, only to have his request denied. He emotionally recounted how he felt that day, sharing that tears welled up in his eyes as he missed out on the opportunity to interact with the actors, despite being within arm’s reach of them. He shared, “I cried that day as I could not meet the actors despite being so close to them.” That challenging experience served as a turning point in his journey, propelling him to strive even harder to break into the Bollywood scene. Approximately a month later, Aasif seized an opportunity to meet with a casting agency but faced criticism about his appearance. Recalling the disheartening encounter, he shared how the manager bluntly remarked on his looks and physique, leaving him feeling dejected. Despite this discouraging feedback, the casting professional advised him to hone his acting skills and master the basics before pursuing opportunities in the industry. Determined to succeed, Aasif made a pivotal decision to return to his roots in Rajasthan, where he immersed himself in a theatre group in Jaipur. Over the span of six years, he dedicated himself to refining his craft and nurturing his passion for acting before making a bold return to Mumbai to once again pursue his dreams in the competitive world of showbiz. Aasif’s fascinating journey in the entertainment industry initially kicked off from a modest role as a casting assistant, showcasing his early foray into the world of showbiz. Transitioning to acting, he embarked on his path as a junior artist, making appearances in notable Bollywood films such as Salman Khan’s Ready, Hrithik Roshan’s Agneepath, Akshay Kumar’s Toilet Ek Prem Katha, and the gripping thriller India’s Most Wanted alongside Arjun Kapoor. In the realm of OTT platforms, Aasif marked his debut in 2018 with the highly acclaimed series Mirzapur, where he captivated audiences with his portrayal of Babar, a steadfast aide. Furthermore, his talents shone in other popular series like Paatal Lok, Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega, Mirzapur 2, and of course, the beloved Panchayat, showcasing his versatility and dedication to his craft across various platforms within the entertainment landscape."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Yatamanyu Narain News18.com Last Updated: June 17, 2024, 19:07 IST Mumbai, India Netizens are speculating that the initial episode of House of the Dragon Season 2 was uploaded on JioCinema with certain scenes censored. House of the Dragon is set to ignite screens once again on June 17 for its second season, making its debut on Max (formerly HBO Max) and in India on JioCinema. Surprisingly, the new season in India arrived amidst a cloud of uncertainty. Recent reports sparked by a social media post suggest that the initial episode of House of the Dragon Season 2 was uploaded on JioCinema with certain scenes censored. The source of concern for certain netizens stems from the disparity in episode length between the versions on Max and JioCinema. While reports suggest that the international broadcast runs for around 58 minutes, the JioCinema version clocks in at approximately 55 minutes. This three-minute reduction has led to suspicions that scenes may have been edited from the Indian release. First, #TheBoys S4 was cut and censored by @PrimeVideoIN Now, @JioCinema shortens the episodes of #HouseoftheDragon S2, some cuts and censored scenes were there… Are you happy with this sort of treatment towards the fans? pic.twitter.com/lArK2QyAhR — BINGED (@Binged_) June 17, 2024 But the question still looms: Has JioCinema truly censored House of the Dragon? The answer remains shrouded in mystery for now. From available information, it appears that the violent and intimate scenes in the JioCinema version are unaltered. Moreover, JioCinema’s support team, responding on X, vouched for the unedited nature of the episode, addressing a subscriber’s concerns. They attributed any alterations in runtime to ‘technical aspects,’ further adding to the mystery surrounding this speculation. Hi Vivek! There are no edits made to the episode by JioCinema. Certain technical aspects affect the runtime of the episode without edits to the visual content. Rest assured the episode is exactly what has been received from the production house.— JioCinema Care (@JioCinema_Care) June 17, 2024 According to a report by Latestly, the initial episode of House of the Dragon Season 2 maintains its integrity, even with the inclusion of two intimate scenes—namely, one depicting cunnilingus and another referencing a child’s murder, portrayed through eerie sound design rather than visual depiction. Despite this content, the essence of the episode seems unaltered. The whereabouts of the missing three minutes and the nature of the described ‘technical aspects’ responsible for their absence are yet to be ascertained. This Game of Thrones spin-off focuses on the Targaryen history. The first season set the ball rolling, introducing the GoT fans to Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith), Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke), Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D’Arcy), Rhaenys Targaryen (Eve Best), Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) and other Targaryen ancestors. The first season ended on a high, showing a civil war break out within the Targaryen family. The new season is set to take off from those final moments. In the first episode, which News18 Showsha watched and reviewed, the Targaryen are plotting against each other while the fight for the Iron Throne continues. The new season also teases the thirst for revenge after Queen Rhaenyra’s son Aemond Targaryen killed Lucerys Velaryon. The first episode also hints a gory season. The new season also features a number of new cast members. These include Clinton Liberty, Jamie Kenna, Broome Kieran Bew, Tom Bennett, Tom Taylor, Vincent Regan, Abubakar Salim, Gayle Rankin, Freddie Fox and Simon Russell Beale."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Chirag Sehgal News18.com Last Updated: June 18, 2024, 13:24 IST Mumbai, India Sharmin Segal and Aditi Rao Hydari played the roles of Alamzeb and Bibbojaan respectively in Heeramandi. (Photos: Instagram) Ever since the release of Heeramandi, several videos of Sharmin Segal surfaced on social media which left many wondering if she was “arrogant” on sets with her co-stars, especially Aditi Rao Hydari and Sanjeeda Sheikh. Recently, Sharmin also opened up about such allegations and explained that her interview clips were “being taken out of context.” Sharmin revealed that she shared a “cordial” relationship with Aditi and urged people to watch her full interviews rather than judging her based on 10-second edited clips. “Some of my co-stars have spoken graciously as to how these interviews were taken out of context. I share a very cordial equation with both Aditi and Sanjeeda. I wish that people would not use 10-second out-of-context clips to define the relationship I share with them,” Sharmin told Zoom as quoted by Indian Express. The clarification comes days after Sharmin called Aditi a ‘school girl’ for punctuality on sets. In a viral video on Instagram, Sharmin talked about Aditi when she said, “Aditi is a good school girl, please understand that. Teacher will say you have to submit your home work at this time and Aditi will do exactly that and not one more word than the word count limit. That is Aditi for you. So, according to her everyone is late and she is on time.” The actress was criticised for her behaviour. Meanwhile, Sharmin was also criticised for her performance in the show. She played the role of Alamzeb in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s directorial. Recently, Sharmin was speaking exclusively to News18 Showsha when she opened up about the trolling and said, “I had given my all to Alamzeb’s character. We tend to fixate on the negatives but there are so many positives that have also come along, which we don’t talk about. It’s perhaps not interesting enough to talk about positives and we tend to look over them to some degree.” “There was a point when I was not looking at many things [reviews] but then slowly, I realised that I was also missing out on a lot of love that I was getting. I’ve now started paying attention to that. Over the last few days, I decided to look through it all. The audience’s opinion is what will probably help you be the best version of yourself,” the actress added."

    "article_content": "Published By : Chirag Sehgal PTI Last Updated: June 19, 2024, 17:35 IST Mumbai, India Jameel Khan played the role of Santosh Mishra in Gullak. (Photo: Instagram) “Gullak” star Jameel Khan still remembers his father’s words when they argued over a white lie the elder Khan had told when he was young. And they were: “You won’t be able to make it in business.” What he did not know at the time was that his father’s words would turn out to be prophetic and he would go on to chart a different course in Mumbai, far away from the family’s thriving carpet business in Bhadohi, Uttar Pradesh. Interestingly, he found fame while playing Santosh Mishra, a middle-class patriarch in the popular SonyLIV series “Gullak”, which the actor says reflects the upbringing he and many in India have received. “There are many people of my age, who come from lower middle class and have made a mark for themselves, for whom the show evokes a sense of nostalgia… It’s a show written with a lot of love, served with a lot of love,” Khan told PTI in an interview. “We are in season four and it is on par with the previous seasons, if not higher. That’s the love of the audience, they have related so wonderfully with the show,” the actor said about the TVF-produced show that revolves around the daily life of the Mishra family, living in a nondescript Uttar Pradesh city. Khan was born in an upper-middle-class business family from Bhadohi, home to the largest hand-knotted carpet weaving industry hub in South Asia. Much like everyone else in the town, his father was also in the same business, specialising in Persian designs. He describes it as a “simple but happy and privileged background”. Recalling the argument with his father, the actor said, “We had a carpet business and we used to live right above the workshop. One day, a worker came and told my father that some sahab was asking for him… My father asked the worker to say that he wasn’t at home. As soon as he left, I asked him ‘Why did you lie?'” His father brushed off the incident as a business matter but the actor stuck to his guns. “No, you lied!” he had said. “My father then explained why he had to do so for the sake of business. But I was still not convinced. He then said with a laugh ‘Tumse jo hai na, business nahin ho payega life mein’ (‘You won’t be able to do business in life’). For me, it was either black or white.” Khan, who did his schooling from Nainital’s Sherwood College and completed his graduation from Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and masters from University of Mumbai, said whatever he has achieved in life is because of his parents and their upbringing, which gave him a strong sense of morality. The shift to Mumbai came as a culture shock for the actor. “Raising one’s voice is something that’s frowned upon in our house. No abusive language or ‘tu-tadak’ (informal) at all. Then, I came to Bombay, which is culturally a very different place. So, (I would be shocked) when people would refer to me using words like ‘tu’ or ‘tum’… But I understood that’s how the language is here. I speak to my children using ‘aap’… I feel everybody deserves respect whether they are younger or junior to you,” he said. For many viewers who love “Gullak”, he is Santosh Mishra, the affable, honest father stuck in a dead-end government job. But the 49-year-old’s career is filled with several milestones, whether it’s his feature debut with Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s “Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam” in 1999, “Baby” or his small but memorable role in “Gangs of Wasseypur”, directed by Anurag Kashyap. Khan credits his love for theatre for leading him to Mumbai, where he found a window into the entertainment world through veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah’s theatre group Motley. “I did many plays with them, two of my favourites are ‘Manto Ismat Haazir Hain’ and ‘Katha Collage’, which changed my life. People got to know about Jameel Khan, the actor, through this play and from there I was cast in films, advertisements and for voiceovers.” There was a gap after “Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam” for the actor because he was doing theatre passionately. “I used to ignore films thinking I’ll take one up only when it’s a good one and on my terms. I’ll do theatre first, then films. Theatre was my first priority. When I got married, I realised I had to shoulder responsibilities, so I could no longer ignore films. I had to earn money. I started doing more films and then OTT happened.” Then came “Gangs of Wasseypur”. Working with director Anurag Kashyap was another experience for Khan, who said he got “a lot of scope to play” while essaying the role of Asghar Khan, the sworn cousin of Manoj Bajpayee’s Sardar Khan. There are many breakout performances for the actor across mediums, “Gullak” being the latest. “In films, there was this very lovely indie film called ‘Loins of Punjab’. There was this paint commercial, ‘Waah Sunil Babu, naya ghar, nayi gadi, nayi Mrs, badhiya hai’. These are those milestones that will be remembered, then there was the ad ‘Shauq badi cheez hai’. “Then, ‘Baby’, ‘Gangs of Wasseypur’, ‘Ram-Leela’… And, now ‘Gullak’ has been a milestone since 2019 because it’s there constantly in public memory. The reach of OTT is really wide. That’s also why it’s a breakout performance.”"

    "article_content": "Curated By : Chirag Sehgal News18.com Last Updated: June 19, 2024, 19:12 IST Mumbai, India Sharmin Segal played role of Alamzeb in Heeramandi. (Photo: Instagram) Sharmin Segal was brutally trolled after Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar was released in May this year. A section of netizens were highly disappointed with her performance in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s directorial. Netizens had also questioned Sharmin for smiling in a scene where her character Alamzeb was rejected by her love, Tajdar (essayed by Taha Shah). In a recent interview, Sharmin opened up about the scene and explained that she was smiling because it was “dark humour”. The actress mentioned Alamzeb was laughing at herself in that scene because she left her home for a man who refused to accept her reality. “‘Oh, is it because I smile in that scene?’ For me, Alamzeb was laughing at herself because she ran away from her house for that. It was like a sad joke one cracks on themselves. It was dark humour in my mind,” Sharmin told India Today. “Alamzeb’s eyes are welled up, she is sad. It’s very different. I am not blaming the medium but everyone watched it on a smaller screen, hence [missed out on details]. Her eyes are welled up, moist, and there is a smile on her face because of the situation, it’s like smiling at your misfortune,” the actress continued. Sharmin further explained that Alamzeb was smiling at her “misfortune” and not because she was rejected by her lover. “Humans have different ways of reacting to different things. Sometimes, when you’re in the dumps, you end up laughing at yourself because you’re like, ‘How did I get here?’ Most people always associate a smile with something happy, but smiles come out in the weirdest situations, and it usually comes out when you’re trying to mask another emotion. I just interpreted it as her laughing at herself or smiling at her misfortune. So, that’s how I interpreted that scene, and I hope it’s clarified now,” she said. Previously, Sharmin was also speaking exclusively to News18 Showsha when she opened up about the trolling and said, “I had given my all to Alamzeb’s character. We tend to fixate on the negatives but there are so many positives that have also come along, which we don’t talk about. It’s perhaps not interesting enough to talk about positives and we tend to look over them to some degree.” Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar is currently streaming on Netflix."

In that same interview, Richa has looked at me and said ‘acha tujhe khana bhi banana aata hai?

The Amazon original crime-thriller Mirzapur that narrates the story of the infamous druglord Akhandanand Tripathi, nicknamed as Kaleen Bhaiyaa from Uttar Pradesh’s titular town of the same name had hooked viewers since the time it dropped on the streaming platform back in 2018.

Bigg Boss OTT 3 has been generating quite a buzz for itself. Right from the controversial contestants to the new host, Anil Kapoor, the show has its fans on their toes. However, seems like not everyone is happy with the list of contestants this year. Bigg Boss alumna Devoleena Bhattacharjee recently took to her Instagram story to slam Vada Pav Girl aka Chandrika Gera Dixit. Devoleena wrote, “So those who ask me Bigg Boss mein jaane ke liye kya karna padta hai? Kahan audition deni padti hai? Ans: Waise humare time pe asa nahi tha. Waqt badal gaya Hain Jazbaat badal gayee hai (So, those who ask me, ‘What do you have to do to get into Bigg Boss? Where do you have to give the audition?’ Answer: Well, in our time, it wasn’t like this. Times have changed. Feelings have changed). She added, “Filhal ki condition ko dekh kar main confirm hoon raaste pe continuously one month chillaiye, jhagda kijiye, 1-2 thappad jadh denge toh police station jaana padega jisse apki publicity mein chaar chaand lag jayega.

He shared a video in which he was seen upset and said, “Jo mereko personal level pe jaante hai unko pata hai 2023 mere ott 3 ki baat chit shuru ho gaye the. Mereko vada pav wali se replace kar diya. Ek baar ko Kataria (Lovekesh Kataria aka Love Kataria) se karte toh samjh aata. Han chalo bhai ki fan following hai, Elvish bhai ki fan following, duniya bhar ki audience aayege, JioCinema ko audience chahiye toh samjh mein ata. Par bhai vada pav wali se replace. Baki guys koi nai. Aaj sapne pure na hue, baad mein zaroor honge. Koi nai guys.” Recently, the makers of the popular reality show dropped a major hint about the first contestant. Curious guessed that it was none other than Vada Pav girl aka Chandrika. Taking to the Instagram handle, Jio Cinema dropped photos featuring people standing in front of a stall.

    "article_content": "Curated By : Shreyanka Mazumdar News18.com Last Updated: June 22, 2024, 07:29 IST Mumbai, India Ranvir Shorey and Salman Khan have worked together in Ek Tha Tiger. Over the past two years, viewers have seen famous Bollywood stars on Bigg Boss. In 2022, director Sajid Khan was on Bigg Boss 16, and last year, actress Pooja Bhatt was a contestant on Bigg Boss OTT 2. This year, actor Ranvir Shorey will join Bigg Boss OTT 3. In an interview with Indianexpress.com, Ranvir said he would have preferred Salman Khan as the host instead of Anil Kapoor. He also noted that the environment will be tough for him due to his temperament. Ranvir explained why he joined Bigg Boss OTT 3, saying he gets offered the show every year but couldn’t join before. This year, with his son in the US for summer vacation and no major work commitments, he felt it was the right time. “Actually, I get a call from Bigg Boss every year, but due to some reasons, I was unable to participate. But this year my son is going to the US to spend his summer vacations and I had no major work. The second reason I think is I badly needed a detox from screens. This year everything clicked and fell into place. My family and friends understood my reasons for doing it at this moment and also that I’m old enough to own up to decisions and consequences. ” Ranvir talked about how he plans to manage in the Bigg Boss house and whether he has the right personality for it. He said, “I am not the coolest person, I tend to lose my calm over small issues. So this is going to be a challenge for me. But I’m not going under any pressure. Also, limited food is going to be a challenge. But I’m hoping they’ll give us sufficient food that’s needed to survive. I’m sure they’re not calling us to starve. But I am going to keep telling myself, you’re just going to be here for a month or so, so chill. My strategy is to keep myself busy. Doing household chores, doing exercises, and healing my body. ” Many people have mixed feelings about Anil Kapoor replacing Salman Khan as the host of Bigg Boss OTT this year. Ranvir also felt a bit disappointed, saying, “If Salman Sir had been hosting the show, it would have made me happier as I have worked with him in the past, and it would have been in my favour as a contestant. But Anil sir is a legend and a very charming person and brings with him a certain hugeness, so I am quite excited but also hoping that he will cut me some slack.”"

On Thalapathy Vijay’s 50th birthday, director Venkat Prabhu unveiled the first look from their upcoming film, The Greatest of All Time. Titled The GOAT Bday Shots, the 50-second video features Vijay in a double role engaged in a thrilling chase sequence. The footage shows an older Vijay riding a motorcycle in Russia with the younger Vijay seated behind, firing at pursuers. The scene intensifies as they try to escape, eventually turning to face their pursuers head-on. Venkat Prabhu wrote on X (formerly Twitter, “Happy birthday to THE GOAT @actorvijay na. Love you na.\" The movie is a sci-fi action story about time travel. Vijay plays two roles: a nerdy middle-aged man and a cool young guy. People think they might be the same person from different times. Recently, GOAT was being shot in Kerala, but the film has now wrapped up its Kerala schedule. The next filming schedule is set to take place in Dubai and Vijay has reportedly already left for Dubai to continue shooting. According to a report, the GOAT team is preparing to film an action sequence in Dubai. The upcoming shooting schedule for the movie is expected to extend until the elections, after which the entire team is scheduled to return to India. Previous shooting locations for the film include Hyderabad, Chennai, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Pondicherry. While fans eagerly anticipate GOAT, many are still disheartened by the realisation that this may be one of the last times they see their idol on screen. After years of speculation about entering politics, Vijay finally formed a political party named Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam in February of this year. However, his political entry came at a price, as the actor-turned-politician announced his retirement from films shortly thereafter. According to reports, after GOAT, Vijay will appear in one more film before bidding farewell to his acting career to focus fully on politics. In April, the makers released an official poster with the release date of the film. The new poster showed Vijay with a salt-and-pepper look, wearing glasses that give him a nerdy vibe. It also depicted a bomb blast in what looks like Europe and a passport with many visa stamps, hinting at the movie’s diverse settings. The poster also reveals the release date – September 5."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Entertainment Bureau Last Updated: June 22, 2024, 16:14 IST Mumbai, India The film was released on June 14. The Marathi language biographical film Sanghasrh Yoddha Manoj Jarange Patil, based on the life of an activist of Maratha quota rights, Manoj Jarange Patil, hit the theatres on June 14. Helmed by Shivaji Doltade and produced by Govardhan Doltade under Sonai Films Creation, the film featured Rohan Patil in the lead role. The other cast members of the film include Gayathri Jadhav, Mohan Joshi, Sandeep Pathak, Suresh Vishwakarma, Sagar Karande, Shubhangi Latkar and Shrinivas Pokale. Talking about the collection, the film has been struggling at the box office since its release. On its 2nd Friday, as per a report by Sacknilk, the film minted just Rs 2 lakh, taking the film’s total one-week collection to Rs 53 lakh, Net India. On the opening day, the film minted Rs 8 lakh, followed by Rs 9 lakh on the second day and Rs 16 lakh on the third. The film’s first weekend Net India collection was Rs 33 Lakh. Sanghasrh Yoddha Manoj Jarange Patil is reportedly made at a budget of Rs 4 crore. It was slated to hit the theatres on April 26, 2024, but was shifted to June due to the Lok Sabha elections. It received the Censor Board’s approval without any objections to its scenes. The film was majorly shot in the Jalana district of Maharashtra. Also, a few portions have been shot in Mumbai. The film is written and backed by Govardhan Doltade. Sudhir Nikam has written the screenplay and dialogue. Sonai Film Creations backed the project. Talking about Manoj Jarange Patil, he hails from the Mantori Village in the Beed district of Maharashtra. He initially joined the Maratha reservation movement with the Indian National Congress 15 years ago and participated in several marches and protests. He also sold 2.5 acres of agricultural land out of his four acres to meet his daily needs. Following the Supreme Court’s 2021 decision to invalidate the Maratha reservation quota, Jarange-Patil protested across the state, including a three-month agitation in Sasht-Pimpalgaon in Jalna district, where hundreds of people joined him. He gathered all the eyeballs during a hunger strike in September last year in Ataravali-Sarate village."

During the pre-release event, Big B opened up about his first reaction when he was offered the role of Ashwatthama. “When Nag Ashwin came and explained his idea to me, for the long time after he left I was thinking, ‘What the hell is Nagi drinking?’” Amitabh said. “To see something like this which is absolutely outrageous, some of the visuals that you have seen are unbelievable. To have somebody conceive a project which is so futuristic and possible… and during the making of the film, you realise that no matter what he thought of he actually brought all the material, all the effects, every kind of vision that he had to the screen and that’s been really amazing. For me to be just a part of it, has been an experience I’ll never forget,” the veteran actor added. Kalki 2898 AD will hit theatres on June 27, 2024."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Titas Chowdhury Edited By: Shrishti Negi News18.com Last Updated: June 18, 2024, 04:43 IST Mumbai, India Ishq Vishk Rebound is set for a theatrical release on June 21. 21 years after young adult rom-com Ishq Vishk that launched the careers of Shahid Kapoor, Amrita Rao and Shenaz Treasury comes Ishq Vishk Rebound. The spiritual sequel presents an array of fresh faces like Rohit Saraf, Jibran Khan, Pashmina Roshan and Naila Grrewal and explores modern-day relationships. Its trailer has a heavy hangover of Ishq Vishk with tracks like Ishq Vishk Pyaar Vyaar and Chot Dil Pe Lagi witnessing a modern makeover. Recently, Shahid took to his Instagram story extending his best wishes to the cast of Ishq Vishk Rebound as he wrote, “Hope this will be as special for you as it was for me 21 years back. Best of luck.” And now, in an exclusive chat with News18 Showsha, Shenaz reveals that glimpses from the new film left her ‘nostalgic’. The latest version of the song Chot Dil Pe Lagi that was originally picturised on her and Shahid and captured their endearing chemistry also impressed her. She tells us, “I’ve watched a little bit of it. It’s cute. It’s nice to see the same songs and it did make me a little nostalgic. I wish the new actors of Ishq Vishk Rebound all the best. I hope the film becomes a big hit like Ishq Vishq. The new version of Chot Dil Pe Lagi looks really cute. I’m very excited to watch the movie. I’ll go to watch it for sure.” The Ken Ghosh directorial may have emerged as a sleeper hit at the box office back in 2003, Shenaz, who was a VJ with MTV, confesses that she couldn’t milk the attention that it brought her. “Surprisingly, it didn’t change my career. I did the movie and went back to MTV. And then I fell in love with a guy and moved to Thailand and did shows for MTV Asia. And then we moved to Hong Kong. We left India four years after Ishq Vishq, which wasn’t the best decision to take in terms of career. But I was in love. You do crazy things when you’re in love,” she shares. But it is this theme of young love that she believes made Ishq Vishk special. “Young love is a beautiful thing. It’s all about going in there fresh – with no expectations and no disappointments. I just love it. I wish I could go back to young love. And Ishq Vishq was all about that,” recalls Shenaz, who’s a popular travel vlogger today. So, what’s her most vivid memory from the shoot of the film? “My fondest memory was when I would be rehearsing with Shahid even before the actual shoot began. We used to meet and rehearse together. That used to be a lot of fun. But I had the most fun when I went to the set to shoot for the song Kaun Hai Woh. That was, in fact, the first day of the shoot of Ishq Vishk. I didn’t really know what was happening around me. It was all very interesting and exciting!” she says."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Titas Chowdhury Edited By: Shrishti Negi News18.com Last Updated: June 19, 2024, 02:03 IST Mumbai, India Sharmin Segal had spoken about being bullied and fat-shamed for 14 years. Time and again, actors, particularly women, have raised their voices about how they’ve been at the receiving end of relentless body shaming. The beauty standards in the Hindi film industry are so high and set in the stone that many often succumb to them, eventually agreeing to go under the knife. During the release of her debut film Malaal in 2019, Sharmin Segal Mehta too revealed how she was bullied and fat-shamed as a child for 14 years, which went on to leave an indelible impression on her. Incidentally, she recently became the subject of incessant trolling and criticism for her portrayal of Alamzeb in Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar. While some mocked her acting skills, others left no stone unturned in attacking her for the way she looks claiming she wasn’t the perfect fit for Alamzeb. In an exclusive chat with News18 Showsha, Sharmin says that she shares a more compassionate and empathetic relationship with her body now. “I love my body but there are days when I’m not happy with the way I look. I feel bloated sometimes. If I eat French fries for dinner, I feel bloated the very next day. Coming to terms with how you look is a slow process because your body keeps changing,” she tells us. So, what has helped her reach this stage where she’s comfortable with the way she looks? “Your mind-set has to keep evolving along with it. Today, I’m a lot more comfortable within that change in my mind-set. I know that my body will keep changing. At the end of the day, we’re all women. We go through periods and pregnancy and those things have a physical impact on our bodies,” she states. While she has managed to wrap her head around this ‘mentally’, Sharmin confides there are days when she wishes she had the looks of a supermodel. “Coming to terms with those changes that are out of our control and still be comfortable with yourself and work towards being the best version of yourself that makes you happy is tough. Sometimes you may work out every day but that might not show on your body. But you need to be okay with putting in that effort knowing that it may not show. And yes, sometimes I wish I looked like Bella Hadid,” she laughs. Talking about how actors also face the additional burden of the audience judging them for their looks, she remarks, “When you’re accepting of who you’re as a person and how you look, that comes out through the authenticity of your craft. The audience judging you for how you look has an impact on your work. It’s sad that it comes in the way of your craft but that’s changing now for the better.” In fact, Sharmin is happy with the changing portrayal of women onscreen and she lauds the inclusive nature of the film industry for embracing women actors of all shapes and sizes. “Things are very different today. The standards of beauty have really changed. Thank god for that! We can now be ourselves,” she says."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Titas Chowdhury Edited By: Shrishti Negi News18.com Last Updated: June 19, 2024, 03:26 IST Mumbai, India Ishq Vishk spiritual sequel Ishq Vishk Rebound is set to release on June 21. 21 years after Ishq Vishk that defined meet-cute college romance, comes its spiritual sequel Ishq Vishk Rebound. Recently, Shenaz Treasury, who had marked her debut along with Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao in the first film, expressed how the new film headlined by Rohit Saraf, Jibran Khan, Pashmina Roshan and Naila Grrewal, washed her over with nostalgia. She also referred to the recreation of Chot Dil Pe Lagi as ‘cute’. As Ishq Vishk Rebound is all set to hit the big screens on June 21, Shenaz walks down the memory lane and exclusively talks to News18 Showsha about being a part of the franchise about young love. “I can’t believe that I did Ishq Vishq. It just happened. It became a big hit and achieved a cult status. Now everywhere I go and whoever I meet, they all talk to me about Ishq Vishq. They tell me that they’ve watched it 50-55 times whereas I’ve just watched it twice (laughs),” she says. Working on the 2003 film was a bittersweet experience for Shenaz, who’s a popular travel vlogger today. While she fondly remembers a few moments with Shahid, she didn’t really get along with Amrita on the set. “With Amrita, I don’t really have any fond memory. But I do have some funny ones. I guess we didn’t really hit it off (laughs),” she says. Prod her further and she continues, “When we went to Cape Town to shoot a song, the dance director kept telling us what to do. I was trying hard to get the step right and she went like, ‘I can do it! Let me do it!’ I remember that very clearly. I had a lot of fun shooting for that one scene with her where I walk up to her and tell her, ‘What are you doing? Why are you with my boyfriend?’ That scene was really fun! I guess that tension between us was great because it worked for the movie (laughs).” Talking about Shahid, she shares, “I’ve memories of sitting in a car with Shahid and waiting for a shot and chitchatting. He told me, ‘How can you go back to MTV? You should take this movie career seriously.’ And I remember telling him that MTV was paying me a salary and the movies don’t pay anything and it was true that they weren’t paying anything because we were just starting out.” And though Shahid wanted her to continue doing films, she went back to VJing with MTV. “He told me that I should put in more work and keep going. He was right because all of that eventually paid off for me. That conversation was interesting. I remember sitting there and debating what we should do with our careers and how he thought that that my going back to MTV was a wrong choice,” adds Shenaz, who penned a book titled All He Left Me Was A Recipe last year."

Alia Bhatt spoke about her upcoming film Love & War for the first time in an exclusive chat with News18 Showsha. The Sanjay Leela Bhansali film was announced earlier this year and broke the internet for multiple reasons. The film is titled Love & War and it not only reunites Alia with her Gangubai Kathiawadi director but also marks Ranbir’s first film with Bhansali since Saawariya. This will also mark her second film with Ranbir after Brahmastra. The film also stars Vicky Kaushal, who worked with Alia in Raazi and Ranbir in Sanju. Speaking with us, Alia said that she is excited for the film for various reasons. “There are so many layers to look forward to, that I don’t know which one to pick. First and foremost, the pleasure and honour of working with Sanjay sir, once again, under his guidance and gaze, flourish is step number one. You can go anywhere with it because of his attention to detail and his attention to you,” Alia said. But as an audience member, Alia said she intrigued to see her husband, Ranbir Kapoor in it. “I, as an audience, am more excited to see him [Bhansali] and Ranbir collaborate, again, after so many years. I am like, ‘wow, what’s that going to be like?” Talking about reuniting with Vicky Kaushal, Alia added, “Vicky and I coming together again; Ranbir and Vicky created magic with Sanju. So, it is a lot of combinations.” “At the end of the day, the intention is to keep your head down and work hard. Not let the other excitement get in the way, because the excitement about the film and the material is the most important. When you are on set, you just have to give your 180 percent,” Alia said. While we wait to see how Love & War pans out, Alia Bhatt recently turned storyteller with her book Ed Finds A Home. The book was launched recently. On the film front, Alia will next be seen in Vasan Bala’s Jigraa with Vedang Raina. The film is slated to release on October 11, 2024."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Titas Chowdhury Edited By: Shrishti Negi News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 02:32 IST London, United Kingdom (UK) Banita Sandhu plays Sita Malhotra in Bridgerton season 3. Banita Sandhu’s casting in the third season of Netflix’s Bridgerton came as a pleasant surprise for most Indians. Ever since the release of this season (on May 16), she has been sharing BTS images from the sets of the popular series. And recently, she took to Instagram to share a video of the cast grooving to Beyoncé’s Cuff It that instantly went viral. In the caption, she thanked Caleb Obediah – who plays Charles Cho – for getting everyone to move. The video features Banita along with Claudia Jessie (Eloise Bridgerton), Nicola Coughlan (Penelope Featherington), Luke Newton (Colin Bridgerton), Martins Imhangbe (Will Mondrich), Emma Naomi (Alice Mondrich) and others standing on a spiral staircase and matching steps. In an exclusive conversation with News18 Showsha, Banita, who plays Sita Malhotra in the latest season of Bridgerton, reacts to the viral reel. A post shared by Banita Sandhu (@banitasandhu) “It was actually one of my last days on set and we were shooting a big ballroom scene,” she tells us. “There was a lot of waiting around for them [the crew] to set up and stuff. It got to a point where all the cast members were in the room and we were all like, ‘Let’s get off our phones and do something fun’.” The October and Sardar Udham actor further adds, “One of our co-stars Caleb is a really good dancer. So, we were doing dance routines just for fun and to pass time. It was just three of us first and then more people kept joining in and before we knew it, we were doing the Cuff It challenge by Beyoncé on the staircase (laughs)!” The reel also grabbed attention as fans quipped how Nicola was struggling to get her steps right and lauded Claudie for her impeccable moves. Commenting on it, Banita says, “Nicola did try and we’ll have to give it to her. I was also trying and I wasn’t that great. But Claudie just stole the show. She was up there! For every rehearsal that we did, she brought such great energy on set. No wonder that comes through her dance moves!” In Bridgerton, Banita’s Miss Malhotra was primarily seen attending balls and promenading along with her mother and other spinsters. A while back, Nicola and Luke revealed that they enjoyed dance routines with many fans pointing out the complicated footwork. Quiz Banita about it and she shares, “I wouldn’t say it’s tough but it definitely takes a lot of time. The ballroom scenes that I was part of took anywhere between three to six days to shoot.” She, in fact, divulges that shooting each ballroom sequence took about a week’s time. “That’s because there would be so much happening like different snippets of conversations that needed to be shot. Continuity was also a big factor as you needed to be exactly in the same place. I loved doing the ballroom scenes as that’s when everyone would be on set. There was such a great camaraderie between the cast and the crew,” Banita remarks."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Titas Chowdhury Edited By: Shrishti Negi News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 02:44 IST Mumbai, India Anjali Menon's ‘Where are the women in Malayalam cinema?’ Instagram post sparked off a debate. 2024 has already emerged as one of the biggest years for contemporary Malayalam cinema with four films – Manjummel Boys, Aavesham, Premalu and Aadujeevitham (The Goat Life) – crossing the coveted Rs 100 crore mark. But filmmaker Anjali Menon’s post on Instagram – ‘Where are the women in Malayalam cinema?’ – last month brought back the spotlight on the absence of women from recent Malayalam films. Parvathy Thirovothu also acknowledged her concerns and in a recent interview stated that stories are primarily being written about men and that it would be inappropriate to ‘force-fit women’ into them. Ironically, this conversation gained momentum at around the same time when All That We Imagine As Light, a film directed by a woman filmmaker (Payal Kapadia) and revolves around women, won the Grand Prix at this year’s Cannes Film Festival. And interestingly, the latest to join this conversation about the dearth of women characters in Malayalam cinema is Kani Kusruti, who has been making heads turn for her performance in All That We Imagine As Light. Talking to News18 Showsha exclusively, she says, “I can’t specifically talk about Manjummel Boys, where maybe the story didn’t demand female characters. Having said that, I recognise the lack of beautifully written strong female characters and those that aren’t the subject of male gaze.” She continues, “How women think, what their sense of humour is like, how they crack jokes and what are they actually like – these depictions are lacking in most stories today. We either see very bold women smoking and drinking or poor (demure) women. Where are the women having fun? Why don’t we see them onscreen?” Kani believes that female actors need to take matters into their own hands and pen characters that they can enjoy playing onscreen. “There are so many different kinds of women. Why are our amazing writers not being able to write them? Why aren’t we able to play them? I do really ponder on these things. I’m sure that a lot of my co-actors also wonder the same. It seems like we’ll have to start writing such parts even if we aren’t good at writing! I don’t know how else we’ll reach there,” she states. Kani opines that even heroines in mainstream Malayalam films pre-2000s had better arcs to play around with. “In Malayalam cinema, especially in the 70s, the 80s and the 90s, I’ve seen amazingly written part for heroines and other diverse women characters. Yes, they were subjects of male gaze and had patriarchal values instilled in them but at least the actress had the chance to portray a diverse range of characters. That’s missing now,” she rues. Hopeful that the future will bring about some sense of equilibrium, she points out a performance by a peer that stayed back with her. “Once in a while, here and there, I see good characters being written. For example, Bhavana Studios and Syam Pushkaran have created some nice female characters. There’s a director called B Ajithkumar who made a film titled Eeda. The character played by Nimisha (Sajayan) was one of the most fantastic female characters written in a long time. But we’ve a long way to go,” Kani says."

The actor, who was last seen in “Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani” and “Heart of Stone,” will next be seen in “Jigra,” co-starring Vedang Raina. In an exclusive interview with News18.com, Alia divulged a few details about the upcoming movie, directed by Vasan Bala. “It is releasing on October 11, and what I can tell you about it is that it is releasing on October 11, 2024 (laughs). I had a wonderful time working with Vasan Bala. I have such fond memories of working with him, and we are still working on it because post-production is ongoing. He has got the perfect balance of cool and nostalgia,” the actress said. A post shared by Alia Bhatt (@aliaabhatt) Talking about working with Vasan Bala, she further said, “You’ll see so many Easter eggs in his films and in ‘Jigra’ as well. In fact, it used to be like a discovery for me every time I walked onto the set. He has this grounding, old-soul sort of quality, yet he is also so edgy and cool. As a filmmaker, the way he writes and thinks is amazing. I had a blast working with him.” The film also marks her first collaboration with newbie Vedang Raina. When asked how it was working with the Archies actor, she said, “Vedang is just sublime. He plays my brother in the film. I am not going to say much about the relationship we share in the film, but I can definitely say that we had a very seamless, easy-going work relationship.” Besides “Jigra,” Alia is also gearing up for an action-packed spy thriller with Yash Raj Films. The untitled project will see her join the emphatic spies of YRF. That is not all, she will soon begin shooting for “Love & War” with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, where she will reunite with her husband Ranbir Kapoor and “Raazi” co-actor Vicky Kaushal. The film will also see Ranbir and Bhansali come together 17 years after “Saawariya”."

Rohit Suresh Saraf is headlining the new Ishq Vishk film, Ishq Vishk Rebound. The film marks his first big screen project as a leading actor. However, Rohit is not new to the big screen. He has starred in projects such as Dear Zindagi and Vikram Vedha. He is also often remembered for his performance in The Sky Is Pink. Rohit shared the screen with Priyanka Chopra and Farhan Akhtar. In an exclusive chat with News18 Showsha recently, Rohit opened up about one of his fondest memories of Priyanka and it involved Nick Jonas. “We were shooting this one particular sequence where Farhan’s character and my character, after the sister has passed, we sit together and bawl together. It was a heartbreaking scene that we shot together. It was also very beautiful to share that kind of equation with Farhan in that moment. That’s why I love such scenes where you just get to share so much with your co-actor and it was a beautiful scene. That was draining and we were actually bawling,” Rohit told us, referring to the last scene in The Sky Is Pink. “Right after that we went to the farmhouse PeeCee was staying at and her entire family was there and there was Easter. They did like a whole feast for all of us after which all of us, the entire crew, PeeCee’s entire family, including Nick Jonas, all of us danced to Desi Girl. It was great fun,” he added. Released in 2019, The Sky is Pink marked Priyanka’s first film after she married Nick Jonas. It was also a film that she co-produced. Besides Rohit, Farhan Akhtar and Priyanka Chopra, the film also starred former actress Zaira Wasim. Meanwhile, Rohit climbed the ladder of success with the release of his series Mismatch. With Ishq Vishk Rebound, the actor’s popularity is expected to only increase. Directed by Nipun Dharmadhikari, the film also stars Pashmina Roshan, Jibraan Khan, and Naila Grrewal. The film is slated to release on June 21 in cinemas."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Dishya Sharma Edited By: Shrishti Negi News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 04:30 IST Mumbai, India Director Nipun Dharmadhikari talks about Ishq Vishk Rebound. Ishq Vishk Rebound is set to release this weekend. It marks the second film in the Ishq Vishk franchise and features four fresh faces — Pashmina Roshan, Jibraan Khan, Rohit Suresh Saraf and Naila Grrewal. The casting look interesting but director Nipun Dharmadhikari told News18 Showsha exclusively that the toughest character to cast in the film was of Samiya, which was eventually played by Pashmina Roshan. Hrithik Roshan’s cousin Pashmina is making her acting debut in the film. At the trailer launch, producer Ramesh Taurani had revealed she had auditioned for the role and had not revealed her background until her family name popped up when she was signing the contract. In an interview with us, Dharmadhikari said that though the role was tough to cast, when he found Pashmina, he knew she was a perfect fit. “Pashmina was my only choice to play Samiya, nobody else came close. In that list of shortlisted names, there was only one name when it came to Samiya,” the filmmaker said. “I think Pashmina’s character was the toughest to cast, she plays a different character. Once you see the film you will understand. Her character walks a very thin line. But I think she got it absolutely right in her audition. Pashmina herself has a very enduring quality and that worked in her favour, especially when it came to casting Samiya.” Dharmadhikari revealed he did meet a lot of people during the audition stage. “I did meet 15 to 20 people for each role, which is 40 to 50 people,” he recalled. The cast of the film has already become popular among the young generation, thus giving a hope that the film could record a good opening. Ask him if he feels a sense of box office pressure, Dharmadhikari admitted he does feel it. “I think any director would be lying (if they say they didn’t feel the pressure) especially during the first film. It is also about the number of people who come to watch the film which translates into money, yes, but it is also about how many people have liked your work and how many people have actually come to see your work. I do feel that pressure but at the same time, I know for a fact that the whole team have strived hard to make an honest and good film,” he said. Although Ishq Vishk Rebound marks Dharmadhikari’s first film in Bollywood, the director has been active in Marathi film industry for many years. After starring in the 2009 Marathi film Harishchandrachi Factory, he directed Marathi movies such as Baapjanma (2017), Dhappa (2018) and Me Vasantrao (2022). Ishq Vishk Rebound releases on June 21."

I remember we were freezing in the evening and they had to go on to a very important scene which was the Shah Rukh Khan and Hrithik Roshan bench scene,\" he recalled. “My cap kept falling and they kept rushing me. I had to say that big monologue so I remember there came a moment where she said, ‘Guys, calm down, let the kid get his time.’ And she was so nice to me like she kept doing the scene with me with the same intensity and it is just amazing. There’s a reason why these guys are superstars. They are so professional and they are so nice work with,\" Jibraan revealed.

Rumours of Kush Shah quitting Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah made headlines recently after a fan shared a picture online with the actor and revealed he bumped into the young star in New York recently. The fan claimed Kush told him that he had left TMKOC and was in New York to pursue further studies. “Out of nowhere, I found Kush Shah aka Goli in New York, while on my way to the Statue of Liberty. He told me that he has left the show and is pursuing his studies in New York,” the post read as quoted by ETimes, and left many shocked. However, the user also deleted the picture later from his Facebook handle. Kush Shah has been a part of Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah ever since its beginning. He plays the role of Mr and Mrs Hathi’s son, Goli aka Gulabkumar Hathi. TMKOC has been running on television for over 15 years now. While Kush must not be leaving the popular sitcom, several other actors have left the show in the past including Disha Vakani, Bhavya Gandhi, Gurucharan Singh, Shailesh Lodha, Neha Mehta and Jennifer Mistry. Most recently, Raj Anadkat, who used to play the role of Tappu in the sitcom, also left the show. In March 2023, in an exclusive interview with News18 Showsha, TMKOC producer Asit Kumarr Modi talked about whether actors leaving TMKOC has become a concern for the makers. Kumar revealed that it is indeed a ‘very big challenge’. He mentioned that even though he tries hard for the actors to stay back, he cannot do anything if they decide to move on. He also took an indirect dig at those who left his show midway and went on to say that people often quit when they ‘get tired of working hard’. “Some people get tired of working hard, some are associated with the show for so long and therefore want to do something different, there are personal reasons, some want to encash this popularity outside the show,” he had said."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Akriti Anand Edited By: Chirag Sehgal News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 19:37 IST Mumbai, India Bigg Boss OTT 3 will premiere on June 21. Bigg Boss is not just known for its controversies, fierce arguments, major fights or love stories, but is also widely loved for the beauty of its house. Each year, designer Omung Kumar comes up with a new theme to stun everyone with the beauty of the Bigg Boss house. This year too, he has turned the Bigg Boss OTT 3 house into a fantasy world. In an exclusive conversation with News18 Showsha, Kumar spilled the beans on this year’s Bigg Boss OTT 3 house theme and said, “This time we thought we would be coming to a fantasy land – a crazy place where everything is an illusion. There are huge books and a huge dragon that comes out of the wall and goes in. Every wall is speaking for itself. I’ve had some hundred thousand locks and keys all over the place. I’m playing with keys, keyhole, and locks as far as the theme of this season’s house is concerned. You come into this crazy fantasy world. Now you’re locked in. And everything keeps on changing for you.” Speaking about anything that has inspired him from the last season while designing the set, Kumar added, “We have seen the trend of how people watch Bigg Boss OTT, like a 24-hour session. So, you have to keep them engaged. That’s why, for me, every wall should talk. It has to be engaging for them also. Like I always say, my set also becomes a contestant. When we think and ideate the creatives, we try to make the house engaging. This time we have just changed the thing around.” Sharing further details about the Bigg Boss OTT 3 house, Omung Kumar continued by saying, “Every time we think about the contestants who are coming inside, we think like, ‘Okay, what is the new thing that we are going to give them?’ This time there are centre beds. We always think about last year’s experiences and make things different.” Bigg Boss OTT 3 will premiere on Friday, i.e June 21 on JioCinema. It will be hosted by Anil Kapoor. Among others, actor Sai Ketan Rao and Vada Pav Girl Chandrika Gera will also be participating in the show this time. YouTuber Arman Malik will also be seen in the show with both his wives, Payal and Kritika."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Titas Chowdhury Edited By: Shrishti Negi News18.com Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 03:05 IST Mumbai, India Tara Sutaria last performed in Mumbai during the reopening if Liberty Cinema and Royal Opera House. Tara Sutaria shot to fame even before she marked her acting debut with Karan Johar’s Student Of The Year 2. Trained in western classical vocal music, she has been singing since the age of seven. By the time she became a film actor, she had already performed in musical productions and proved her mettle as an opera singer in concerts in India and internationally. She also lent her voice to films and commercials. Recently, Tara took to social media to share a throwback video of her performing an opera piece with The Bombay Chamber Orchestra at the reopening of Liberty Cinema in Mumbai in 2016. In the video, she’s seen singing the second verse of Ave Maria, a Latin song, which instantly grabbed the attention of her fans and peers. A post shared by TARA (@tarasutaria) To mark the occasion of World Music Day, News18 Showsha exclusively catches up with Tara, who opens up on her love for live singing and harbouring the dream of taking to the stage again. She tells us, “I’m going to do that, one hundred percent. I made a promise to myself earlier this year as part of my New Year resolution that I’ve to get back to music because if I don’t, I would feel very, very sad.” The prep for the same has already begun and if everything goes as per plan, Mumbaikars will very soon get to witness her perform live on stage. “I’ve actually begun the process of having my own concerts again and I’m in touch with all of these amazing musicians from all over the country to have my first concert after so many years. I’m so excited about it. I’ve received wonderful feedback. It’s going to be a really big one,” she reveals. Looking back at her concert at Liberty Cinema and The Royal Opera House, Tara says, “Just before my debut, I had hosted a couple of solo concerts because I knew that I would be getting a little bit busier in the film space. One of them was at the reopening of very iconic Liberty Cinema and the other was at the reopening of Royal Opera House in South Bombay. Prior to that, I did many shows at NCP and other amazing places in the city that I really miss performing at.” The Apoorva actor adds, “I remember getting standing ovations at Liberty Cinema and The Royal Opera House for two-three minutes. It was such an emotional moment for me because I also knew that this is something I wouldn’t be doing for a little while considering how busy one gets in our industry.” In March this year, Tara piqued the curiosity of many when she shared a post of herself singing in New York and expressed her love for Broadway ballads and ‘old school tune’. Talking about it, she shares, “I went to New York to shoot for an ad campaign. Whenever my sister and I travel, we make it a point to watch a lot of musicals and plays. After one of the musicals, I went to this really famous place in New York where all of the stage performers from musicals go to sing after their shows. I hadn’t sung in a really long time but a lot of our friends told me to go up on stage and sing with the gentleman who was playing the piano.” A post shared by TARA (@tarasutaria) It was, in fact, this episode that nudged her to return to her passion once again. “I sang a song from a really famous musical, the Indian version of which I had been a part of for a couple of years when I was a teenager. I received incredible applause and people were so happy when I sang. It made me feel so valued as a singer again. And that really opened my eyes and made me realise that music is something I really need to get back to,” says Tara, who crooned Shaamat and Galliyaan Returns in Ek Villain Returns."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Titas Chowdhury Edited By: Shrishti Negi News18.com Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 04:36 IST Mumbai, India Much like the film industry, pay parity is an issue in the Indian music scene. A decade ago, Salim Merchant voiced his grudge against how India ‘only has a film industry and no music industry’. And it found resonance in many of his peers over the years. Maybe that’s why Bollywood music has emerged as a genre of its own. Of course, independent music, particularly pop rock, witnessed a major surge in the 90s. At around the same time, a bunch of rock bands like Silk Route, Viva, Euphoria and Indian Ocean began to rule the indie space. In the 2000s, Hindi film music once again began dominating the scene. Today, our singers and musicians are happily working in an industry where Bollywood music and indie music co-exist. Many of them have made their presence felt overseas too. Case in point: Diljit Dosanjh and AP Dhillon sending fans into a tizzy at Coachella. Others are simultaneously taking to the stage at a global scale. However, the one topic of conversation that cannot be evaded is gender politics and pay disparity between male and female singers in the mainstream space. As per reports, Arijit Singh is the highest paid Indian male singer. If statistics are to be believed, he gets paid Rs 18-22 lakh per song. The women barring a few are at a relatively lower end of this chain. This World Music Day, News18 Showsha exclusively catches up with some of the most popular and bankable female vocalists, who bat for equal pay and opportunities and dissect the root cause behind the void. Talking about her experience, Shalmali Kholgade tells us, “I haven’t cared to find out how much my counterparts get paid. I’ve concerned myself only with what I think I deserve. While there are some jobs I put my foot down for the money, I’ve done plenty where I haven’t cared as much for the remuneration but done it for the love of the music. Sometimes I’ve lost the job, but I’ve had no regrets. Sometimes, I’ve gotten my way. Either way, it’s been a win-win.” Shilpa Rao, on other hand, informs us that she has never had to ‘fight for monetary compensation’ but acknowledges the gap in the pay scale. Stressing on the need for equal opportunities, she says, “I feel it’s gradually improving as the industry has become more aware and progressive. There’s a growing recognition of talent and hard work regardless of gender, and many efforts are being made to ensure more female-led stories are conveyed. This will lead to greater equity and opportunities for all female artists in the music industry.” Echoing Shilpa’s sentiments, Kanika Kapoor adds, “There’s a gap but things are improving with more awareness and efforts towards equality. Female singers often still face lower pay compared to their male counterparts but it’s all evolving. It’s important to keep pushing for equal opportunities and equal pay for all artists, regardless of gender.” And has she ever had to ask for what she thinks she rightly deserves? “Yes, it’s important to advocate for fair compensation and ensure that our work is valued appropriately. These experiences have taught me the importance of knowing my worth and not being afraid to assert it,” she remarks. Jonita Gandhi might be at the top of her game today but she has no qualms in admitting how fighting against the norm has become a regular routine. “This literally happens every day (laughs). Fortunately, I’ve a great team that helps me navigate these situations and fight for what I deserve. I believe it’s worth it to set a precedent and raise your standards even if it means losing a few opportunities. It’s the only way people will understand your worth,” she states. Sharing her thoughts on why there’s a pay gap between female and male singers, Jonita explains, “There are a lot of metrics that determine paygrade. I do think there are still gaps because male music artists are still bigger than female music artists in India. In the West, that’s not the case. I hope to be part of the change that is already underway and grow the impact of female musicians in India.” Another conversation that has gained momentum in the last few years is the dearth of Bollywood songs for female singers. Amit Trivedi had once attributed it to the fact that ‘scripts today demand more male-led songs’. And though Shilpa agrees, she quickly points out how ‘a positive shift is paving the way for a more balanced and inclusive musical landscape in films’. “Usually, the stories told are male-led with male perspectives, hence the songs are also from a male perspective. But I believe that while there have been fewer female-led songs in films, this is gradually changing,” says the Besharam Rang and Chaleya singer, adding that ‘filmmakers and composers are increasingly recognising the power and appeal of female-led songs’. According to Jonita, however, this dearth is linked to the dearth of women characters in cinema. “Lesser female songs is generally a result of lesser female lead roles in films. The more female-driven stories we tell, the more female-driven music we’ll possibly hear as far as films are concerned,” says the What Jhumka and Deva Deva singer. Shalmali agrees with Jonita but also believes this dearth stems from the fact that Bollywood has very few female composers. “It’s easier for a male composer to compose in a key comfortable to him and then transpose a few notes up or down. Understanding the female range and then composing for it may be difficult for few composers. When I composed the music for June (an independent Marathi film), I realised it was easier for me to compose for women. A solo male song is also easy, but a duet is the hardest because it needs to suit both the male and female range,” the Pareshaan and Lat Lag Gayee hit-maker elaborates. Kanika, on the other hand, has a positive perspective on this aspect. While she acknowledges the lack of women-led songs in films, she lauds all those women musicians like herself who’ve become the wind beneath their own wings by taking the indie route. “A lot of women are doing their independent releases, collaboration and shows. There’s a growing recognition for independent music and its versatility that women bring to music,” she asserts. The ‘Baby Doll’ hitmaker continues, “So yes, women are taking that courageous step of working on their music. This positive trend is not only celebrating talent but also reflecting the changing dynamics within the music industry, paving the way for more female songs in film too.”"

    "article_content": "Reported By : Titas Chowdhury Edited By: Chirag Sehgal News18.com Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 16:14 IST Mumbai, India Bigg Boss OTT 3 to have its grand premiere tonight. The grand premiere of Bigg Boss OTT 3 is just a few hours away! Glimpses from the reality show have already piqued the curiosity of several fans, who are eagerly waiting to catch it tonight on Jio Cinema Premium. The first confirmed contestant of this season is Chandrika Dixit, popularly known as the vada pav girl. There are strong speculations that Ranvir Shorey, Sai Ketan Rao, Shivani Kumari, Anjum Fakih, Sana Makbul, Sana Sultan, Mika Singh and Arman Malik along with both of his wives, Payal and Kritika, will also be a part of the show. And now News18 Showsha has exclusively learnt the name of another contestant who will join the list. Giovanni DelBiondo, who shot to fame as Anil Kapoor’s doppelgänger a couple of years back, will apparently make his debut in the Indian entertainment space with Bigg Boss OTT 3. A well-placed source tells us, “Giovanni, who’s popularly known as The Lad, will be revealed as one of the contestants at the grand premiere of the show. The body builder and diet coach from Virginia in the USA recently flew down to Mumbai and he’s excited to share the stage with Kapoor. He has been harbouring the dream of becoming a Bollywood actor and he’s looking forward to this new chapter.” This will be the first time that Kapoor and DelBiondo will come together on camera. In an interview with Hindustan Times in 2022, he had revealed that he came to know about his uncanny resemblance with the veteran actor when people started tagging him in one of his earlier pictures. In the same year, DelBiondo took to social media to share a collage featuring himself and Kapoor, which grabbed the attention of Bollywood celebrities like Karan Johar and Varun Dhawan. Reports also suggest that author Shobhaa De has also been confirmed as a contestant on Bigg Boss OTT 3. With an eclectic mix of actors and social media sensations, this season promises amp up the entertainment and drama quotient that the show is known for. As for Kapoor, this is the first time that he has taken on the role of a host for the reality show. The first and the second seasons were hosted by Johar and Salman Khan. Much like every year, Omung Kumar has designed the house along with Vanita Garud. The theme of locks and keys weaves through the décor of the entire house has reminded viewers and fans of the Harry Potter films. Speaking to us exclusively, he said, “This time, we thought we would be coming to a fantasy land – a crazy place where everything is an illusion. There are huge books and a huge dragon that comes out of the wall and goes in… I’ve had some hundred thousand locks and keys all over the place. I’m playing with keys, keyhole, and locks as far as the theme of this season’s house is concerned (sic).”"

    "article_content": "Reported By : Chirag Sehgal News18.com Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 21:44 IST Mumbai, India Sai Ketan Rao and Shivangi Khedkar used to work together in Imlie. (Photo: Instagram) Television actor Sai Ketan Rao has finally entered the Bigg Boss OTT 3 house. The actor was last seen in Mehndi Hai Rachne Wali in which his chemistry with Shivangi Khedkar was widely loved by the audience. The two often used to drop adorable pictures online following which their dating rumours also made headlines. However, when News18 Showsha exclusively spoke to Sai ahead of his Bigg Boss OTT 3 entry, he dismissed their relationship rumours. “It is still rumours. Rumours hi hai,\" Sai told us. An insider told us that Shivangi might be approached for Bigg Boss OTT 3 as a wild card contestant in the coming days. The source claimed that the makers are planning to develop a love story inside the show and Sai might be seen proposing to Shivangi. However, when we quizzed the actor about the same, he told us that there was no truth to it. “If she is actually entering the house, it will be a wonderful thing. I would love to see her back on camera with me,\" he added. Sai Ketan Rao revealed that even he wasn’t sure when he was approached for Bigg Boss OTT 3. “At first, I said, ‘no’. Then I gave a second thought about it. I discussed it with my family and friends. Then I thought, let’s give it a try, let’s experiment with it. Of course, there will be different situations. It will be new for me,\" he said. However, the 29-year-old actor shared that is he “excited\" yet “nervous\" about his Bigg Boss journey now. “I am nervous yet happy because I am going to this wonderful platform. It has many followers. Bigg Boss has a huge audience. I want to target this audience of reality shows now. I want to know them. I want them to know me, my name, my talent. People know me by my character’s name. Now, I want people to know my name,\" he said. Unlike the last season, Bigg Boss OTT 3 is being hosted by Anil Kapoor. Sai opened up about Kapoor replacing Salman Khan as the host and told us, “I am happy that Anil Kapoor sir is hosting the show this time. Of course, I felt a little when I got to know Salman sir wouldn’t be there. I wanted a photo with him. I wanted to see him in person. It isn’t happening as of now. Even ANil sir is one of my favourite actors. I have watched his movies. His comic timing is also very good. He is sarcastic. He will be a fantastic host, I think. He is an interesting person.\""

    "article_content": "Reported By : Titas Chowdhury News18.com Last Updated: June 22, 2024, 12:58 IST Mumbai, India MM Kreem will once again be collaborating with SS Rajamouli after Baahubali, Eega and Magadheera. All eyes are set on SS Rajamouli’s upcoming directorial after the blockbuster and universally loved RRR starring Ram Charan and Jr NTR! Being referred to as SSMB29, this is the first time that the director and Telugu superstar Mahesh Babu has come together for a film. As per Rajamouli, it’s a globe-trotting adventure film in the space of Indiana Jones and Dan Brown novels. And once again, Oscar winning music composer MM Kreem has come on-board to compose music for this magnum opus. In an exclusive conversation with News18 Showsha, Kreem shares an exciting update on the film and reveals that the story has just been finished being written. “I haven’t started working on it yet because the story is just being locked this week. Some test shoots are going on,” he tells us. And he’s currently gearing up to begin his work on the film that’s tentatively titled Maharaja next month. “In July-August, I’ll start my work of composing music for the film,” he informs. Last year, the veteran musician won the Oscar for Best Original Song and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for Naatu Naatu from RRR and created history. One would imagine that it would lead to filmmakers lining up outside his door to help give them another chartbuster like Naatu Naatu but Kreem says that it was a ‘unique’ song and creating another Naatu Naatu won’t be possible. He says, “Nobody has told me to make a song like Naatu Naatu for their films so far. Naatu Naatu was unique to RRR. It was situational song. It wasn’t just a song but also like a story within the film. So, unless other filmmakers come up with something like that, they cannot ask me to make one more Naatu Naatu like the way they usually ask when it comes to an item song.” But has there been any change in his life or career post winning at the 95th Academy Awards? “Life hasn’t changed post Oscars win. Imagine this situation… I go to a mall and ask for a Dairy Milk chocolate and a packet of Maggi noodles. I pick them up and when I walk away, they ask me for money. And I say, ‘I’ve won an Oscar, so you can’t ask me to pay.’ So, you see, winning an Oscar doesn’t make any difference. I still have to pay for what I buy,” says the composer with a laugh, whose next is Neeraj Pandey’s musical love story Auron Mein Kahan Dum Tha starring Ajay Devgn and Tabu. Kreem, who has also worked with Rajamouli on the Baahubali series, Eega and Magadheera, among others, further points out that he hasn’t let it come in the way of his personal and professional relationships. “Just so you know, this episode happened in my mind. All I’m trying to say is that with or without Oscar, you’ll have to pay if you buy something from a shop. Nothing has really changed, not even my working process and relationships,” he states."

(Photo: X) Chandrika Gera Dixit, widely recognised as the “Vada Pav Girl”, has made it to the Bigg Boss OTT 3 house. Known for her Vada Pav stall in Delhi’s Sainik Vihar, Gera entered the controversial reality show on Friday night. However, before her entry, News18 Showsha spoke exclusively to Chandrika and she revealed that she thought it was a ‘fraud’ when she was approached for Anil Kapoor-hosted show. “I took a lot of time to accept the Bigg Boss OTT 3 offer. I wanted to check if it wasn’t a fraud. I had to figure out how the business would be managed in my absence and how my children would be taken care of. I thought about everything else before accepting the offer,” Gera told us. She further revealed that she hadn’t planned anything for Bigg Boss because she believes in living in the present. However, she sent a stern warning to her co-contestants saying she would behave with them, the way they would treat her. “I do not plan things in advance. I believe in living in the present. I do not plan things. When I enter the show, I will analyse everything and then figure out what to do. It is not like, a person who is loving me will be slapped or screamed at. Such people will always be hugged,” she said. Chandrika Gera Dixit further called out those who call her “arrogant” and argued, “If presenting your opinion is being arrogant, then, yes, I am arrogant. I like to take a stand for myself. If somebody is telling me something, I would like to tell him my views also. He should listen to that too. If calling out the wrong is considered arrogant then I am arrogant.” “It will be fun. I want people to know who Chandrika is. If somebody will talk to me nicely, I will be the same with them. If somebody tries to say something about my business or my child, I will deal with them accordingly. Pyaar ka jawab pyaar se, nafrat ka jawan nafrat se,” she concluded. Bigg Boss OTT 3 streams on JioCinema at 9 pm everyday."

Following speculations of Sonakshi Sinha and Zaheer Iqbal’s wedding reception, News18 Showsha had exclusively reported that it would be a star-studded affair. Celebrities like Aayush Sharma, Huma Qureshi, Varun Sharma, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Fardeen Khan, Taha Shah Badussha, Aditi Rao Hydari, Sharmin Segal Mehta and others are expected to grace their big day at Bastian in Mumbai’s Dadar. Reportedly, a registered marriage is taking place today with the couple already having hosted an indoor party for friends and family on June 20. A mehendi ceremony took place on June 21. And now, we’ve exclusively learned the names of more Bollywood stars who will be a part of the party at the high-end restaurant that’s slated to take place tonight. A reliable source tells us, “Sonakshi shares a good camaraderie with most of her peers in the industry. Needless to say, the reception will see some of the most popular names including two popular Bollywood couples – Riteish Deshmukh (who’s Sonakshi’s co-star in the upcoming film Kakuda), Genelia Deshmukh, Jackky Bhagnani, and Rakul Preet Singh.” The source further adds, “Additionally, screenwriter and author Mushtaq Sheikh and Panchayat fame actor Asif Khan are also confirmed guests at the party. Salman Khan who has been Sonakshi and Zaheer’s mentor may also make it. However, there’s no clarity on the same yet.” And now, wait for the clincher! Another little birdie tells us that Diljit Dosanjh who’s making heads turn globally may also make his presence felt at Bastian. This source says, “Diljit is currently in Mumbai. He has been in the city since the last week for meetings and other commitments. The singer-actor and Sonakshi had shared screen space in the 2018 comedy film Welcome To New York and struck a rapport. In 2017, they also collaborated on a song titled Move Your Lakk for the film Noor. With him being in the bay, there are strong chances that he too might make it.” On a related note, Sonakshi and Zaheer’s union has been making news of an alleged conflict between her and her family. However, all of that has been put to rest now as Shatrughan Sinha told Times Now recently, “No one from my family said anything about a wedding. Too much attention is being given to something that is a private family matter. Shaadiyan sab ke ghar hoti hain. Pre-wedding conflicts are also common. We are all okay now. Whatever stress there was has been sorted out.”"

Sonakshi was seen wearing a red saree instead of the white saree she wore for the wedding ceremony. As more videos of Sonakshi’s wedding celebration are surfacing online, the actress was spotted wearing sindoor for the first time since her wedding earlier today. See the photo here: A post shared by yogen shah (@yogenshah_s) A post shared by Manav Manglani (@manav.manglani) Sonakshi Sinha and Zaheer Iqbal are finally married and glimpses from their special day are surfacing on social media. Sonakshi also took to her Instagram handle to drop her first wedding photos. In the caption, she wrote, “On this very day, seven years back (23.06.2017) in each others eyes, we saw love in its purest form and decided to hold on to it. Today that love has guided us through all the challenges and triumphs… leading up to this moment… where with the blessings of both our families and both our gods… we are now man and wife. Here’s to love, hope and all things beautiful with each other, from now until forever ❤️ Sonakshi ♾️ Zaheer 23.06.2024.” Sonakshi looked beautiful in an off-white sari and minimal jewellery. She added white roses to her hair bun. Zaheer looked dapper in a white kurta. In a recent interview, Zaheer’s father, Iqbal Ratansi, shed light on their marriage when he told Free Press Journal, “It will have neither Hindu nor Muslim rituals. It will be a civil marriage.” Zaheer’s father further dismissed reports claiming Sonakshi might convert to Islam after her wedding. “She is not converting and that is for sure. Theirs is a union of hearts and religion has no role to play whatsoever,” he said and then added, “I believe in humanity. God is called Bhagwan by Hindus and Allah by Muslims. But at the end of the day, we are all human beings. My blessings are with Zaheer and Sonakshi.” Zaheer and Sonakshi are now all set to hold a wedding party in Mumbai’s Bastian, and several Bollywood stars are expected to attend. It will reportedly be a star-studded affair. Previously, Honey Singh and Poonam Dhillon confirmed that they have also been invited. A source close to the couple told News18 Showsha earlier that Salman Khan has also been sent an invitation. Sonakshi has also invited her Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar co-stars including Fardeen Khan, Taha Shah Badussha, Aditi Rao Hydari and Sharmin Segal Mehta among others."

After seven years of dating, Sonakshi Sinha and Zaheer Iqbal have finally tied the knot! They said “I do” in an intimate ceremony surrounded by close friends and family. Salman Khan, Sonakshi’s first co-star, attended her wedding reception in style. The Bollywood superstar made a grand entry to the bash at midnight amidst high security. In a video, shared by Voompla on Instagram, Salman was seen avoiding paps as he straightaway went inside an elevator with his security after entering the venue. He looked dashing in a black tuxedo. The actor refused to do the red carpet despite multiple requests from the paps and made a quick exit from the reception without posing for them. A post shared by Voompla (@voompla) A post shared by Voompla (@voompla) A post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani) Salman Khan and Sonakshi Sinha share a special connection that began with the blockbuster film Dabangg, where Sonakshi made her Bollywood debut opposite Salman.

    "article_content": "Reported By : Himani Chandna News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 09:32 IST New Delhi, India Repeatedly reading opinions and counter opinions on the given situation only helps to increase the anger and frustration making one feel like a helpless victim. (Getty Images) Following the postponement of NEET-PG 2024 as a precautionary measure, students who were set to take the exam the next day have been expressing concerns over the sudden decision. The postponement came amid protests over paper leaks and other alleged irregularities in the conduct of NEET undergraduate exam on May 5. To put the story in perspective, NEET-PG usually takes place from December to January. It was delayed and scheduled for March 3 this year. Then it was postponed to July 7 and then advanced to June 23. And now, it stands postponed indefinitely. “Fresh date of this examination will be notified at the earliest,” the ministry said in an official notice. More than 2 lakh doctors were about to take the NEET-PG exam in the next eight hours and the abrupt decision to postpone it has been heavily criticised by the candidates, many of whom had to travel to other cities to appear for the exam – after taking leaves, spending money on travel, and booking accommodation in advance. Social media is inundated with angry posts from NEET aspirants. Dr Suhas Ananthram, an aspirant, posted on X: “I have traveled to another state, staying here for three days spending’s thousand of rupees and this happens? What the hell?” The anger is understandable. However, it’s not the end of the road. The message to the candidates affected by alleged irregularities in NEET-UG and those impacted by the NEET-PG exam postponement is to stay resilient. News18 spoke to multiple mental and physical health experts who advised taking control over emotions causing anxiety, irritability and frustration. Any such uncertainty and disruption can undoubtedly impact the mental and emotional well-being of these aspiring professionals. Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, who was the first rank holder in Kerala state medical entrance in 1986, told me that the recent events make him “cringe”. However, he shared multiple pieces of advice for the candidates while adding that if the prevailing uncertainty is making these aspirants anxious, remember that “uncertainty is a part of being alive on the planet”. He advised to seek professional help instead of self-diagnosing or turning to other substances for temporary relief. “Doctors are just as human as anyone else and can face the same physical and mental health issues. If you constantly feel a loss of interest or motivation, aren’t sleeping well, lack your usual energy, seek professional help instead of self-diagnosing,” said Jayadevan, former president of the Kochi wing of the Indian Medical Association. He also warned that using alcohol or substances for temporary relief is dangerous. Similarly, mental health counsellors also suggest reaching out for support by talking to friends, family, or a mental health professional to share your thoughts and feelings. A psychotherapist, who works as a mental health counsellor at a public hospital, told me while requesting anonymity that some of the affected students have reached out to her to share their “concern over the bleak future”. She advised that it’s essential to maintain a structured daily schedule and self-care routines to preserve a sense of normalcy. “Take care of your physical and mental health by eating well, getting enough sleep, exercising, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.” Mental health professionals acknowledge that entrance exams have always been stressful. However, the ongoing state of affairs would impact the candidates even more severely. For instance, Dr Jyoti Kapoor, a senior consultant psychiatrist and psychotherapist told News18 that the ongoing affairs could be quite frustrating for students. Kapoor, who is also founder-director at Manasthali, Mental Health & Wellness Services, in Gurgaon advised that “it’s important to accept that challenges like these are part and parcel of life and especially as medical practitioners, we face such issues as part of our profession itself, therefore taking care of one’s health is of prime importance.” She also warned students to stay away from consuming too much news. “Beware of overuse of social media and doom-scrolling. It’s better to just have enough necessary information and focus on one’s goals.” Repeatedly reading opinions and counter opinions on the given situation only helps to increase the anger and frustration making one feel like a helpless victim. This impacts the focus and causes an overwhelming surge of negative feelings and emotions. Entrance tests are not going to decide the quality of your life; you are going to do that. At the end of the day, success depends on an individual’s satisfaction and happiness which depends on multiple factors only one of which is the choice of speciality. In short, take control over your nerves and stay informed about any updates regarding the exam, but avoid excessive news consumption which can increase anxiety and agony. It is a challenging time. However, with patience and perseverance, one can overcome it. According to Hyderabad-based neurologist Dr Sudhir Kumar, the NEET-UG fiasco has affected students as young as 16-18 years, many of who have hit the streets in protest. “They should conserve their energies to fight bigger battles and emerge a better doctor in the future,” said Kumar, who works at Apollo Hospital."

(Image: PTI) A two-member team of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) reached Patna on Sunday to probe the NEET-UG 2024 paper leak. This came after the CBI began its probe into the paper leak case and filed an FIR. The CBI team first went to the Shastri Nagar police station. The first FIR in the paper leak case was registered on May 4 at the Shastri Nagar police station. After visiting the Shastri Nagar police station, the CBI team reached the EOU of Bihar Police. This came after the Bihar government issued a notification to transfer the NEET-UG case to the CBI, facilitating the central agency’s intervention. Bihar Police’s EOU arrested five suspects from Jharkhand, linked to the paper leak, bringing the total arrests to 18. The CBI is investigating the case under IPC sections like criminal conspiracy and cheating, focusing on the wider nexus behind the exam irregularities. The Bihar police on Sunday said that the question papers were received by the accused at Learn Play School that was used as a “safe house” by the accused. The economic offences unit said this is the work of an organised interstate racket operating out of Bihar. According to police, the accused, Chintu, who was arrested from Devghat was also present at the playschool when the question papers were received. He got the solved question papers on the mobile phone, police said. Police said Chintu received the solved question paper on his mobile phone on the morning of May 5, the day of the examination, and took printouts of it via a WiFi printer. The students were made to memorise the question paper, they added. The Bihar police said it was well-planned as a drop-off point was made 2 km from the playschool and the students were brought to the playschool in taxi cabs. The question paper received by the accused came from Oasis Play School in Hazaribagh, police said. There is evidence of tampering in the packaging of the question paper, they added. Police have recorded the statements of those working in the State Bank of India, Hazaribagh, and also Blue Dart courier services."

(Image: NHSRCL) The National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) achieved a significant milestone by launching a 130-metre-long steel bridge over the Delhi-Mumbai National Expressway near Vadodara, Gujarat on Sunday, June 23. This bridge is a critical component of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train project, reflecting the country’s progress in high-speed rail infrastructure under the “Make in India” initiative. The entire bridge launching process was completed within 24 hours, despite intermittent breaks to allow road traffic to pass. The bridge, weighing 3000 metric tons, stands 18 metre high and 14.9 metre wide. It was fabricated in Wardha, Maharashtra, and transported to the installation site via trailers. The bridge’s length is notable, potentially making it the longest steel bridge over a national highway in India. The fabrication of this massive structure required approximately 124,246 Tor-Shear Type High Strength (TTHS) bolts. It features a C5 system painting and metallic spherical bearings, ensuring a 100-year lifespan. Assembling the bridge on site involved elevating it 15 metre from the ground using temporary trestles. An automatic mechanism, comprising two semi-automatic jacks with a capacity of 250 tons each, utilised Mac-alloy bars to pull the bridge into place. This project exemplifies meticulous execution, maintaining the highest standards of safety and engineering excellence. It leverages Japanese expertise while utilising India’s technical and material resources. This steel bridge is a prime example of the “Make in India” initiative in action, showcasing the country’s growing capabilities in infrastructure development. This installation marks the third of 28 steel bridges planned for the corridor. The first was launched across National Highway 53 in Surat, and the second over the Vadodara-Ahmedabad main line of Indian Railways near Nadiad, Gujarat. Steel bridges are particularly suitable for crossing highways, expressways, and railway lines, offering advantages over pre-stressed concrete bridges, which are typically used for spans of 40 to 45 metre, including river crossings. India has extensive experience in fabricating steel bridges for heavy haul and semi high-speed trains operating between 100 and 160 km/h. This expertise is now being applied to the Bullet Train corridor, which will boast an operational speed of 320 km/h. The successful launch of this steel bridge underscores India’s capability to undertake complex infrastructure projects, paving the way for the country’s high-speed rail future."

(Representative Image) Women government employees can take 180 days of maternity leave in case they have children through surrogacy after amendments were announced to a 50-year-old rule by the Centre. It has also allowed the “commissioning mother” (the intending mother of the child born through surrogacy) with child care leave besides paternity leave of 15 days to the “commissioning father”, according to the changes made in the Central Civil Services (Leave) Rules, 1972. “In case of surrogacy, the surrogate, as well as the commissioning mother with less than two surviving children, may be granted maternity leave of 180 days, in case either or both of them are government servants,” read the amended rules notified by the Personnel Ministry. Till now, there were no rules to grant maternity leaves to women government employees in case a child was born through surrogacy. “In case of a child begotten through surrogacy, the commissioning father who is a male government servant with less than two surviving children may be granted paternity leave of 15 days within 6 months from the date of delivery of the child,” the new rules said. In the case of surrogacy, the commissioning mother with less than two surviving children, may be granted child care leave, reads the Central Civil Services (Leave) (Amendment) Rules, 2024, notified on June 18. Existing rules allow “a female government servant and single male government servant” child care leave for a maximum period of 730 days during entire service “for taking care of two eldest surviving children, whether for rearing or for looking after any of their needs, such as education, sickness and the like”. The “surrogate mother” shall mean the woman who bears the child on behalf of the commissioning mother and the expression “commissioning father” would mean the intending father of the child born through surrogacy, the Personnel Ministry clarified in the amended rules."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Sanstuti Nath News18.com Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 11:18 IST New Delhi, India A fresh plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the CBI and the ED to investigate the alleged irregularities in the NEET-UG (Image: PTI) Amid allegations over the integrity of certain competitive examinations, the Centre has postponed of National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test-Postgraduate 2024 (NEET-PG 2024), which was scheduled to be held on June 23, Sunday. Meanwhile, as many as 1,563 NEET-UG 2024 candidates, who were given grace marks for loss of time, are set to appear for the retest across centres today. Facing flak over alleged discrepancies in competitive exams, the Centre on Saturday shunted out National Testing Agency (NTA) Director General Subodh Singh and handed over the probe into irregularities in the medical entrance exam NEET-UG to the CBI. The Education Ministry also set up a seven-member panel headed by former ISRO chief K Radhakrishnan to review the agency’s functioning and recommend exam reforms. The Education Ministry has postponed the NEET-PG entrance, the fourth entrance exam to be impacted in recent days, calling it a “precautionary measure” in the wake of recent allegations on the integrity of certain competitive exams. The fresh date of the examination will be notified at the earliest, the Union Health Ministry said. “Taking into consideration, the recent incidents of allegations regarding the integrity of certain competitive examinations, the Ministry of Health has decided to undertake a thorough assessment of the robustness of processes of NEET-PG Entrance Examination, conducted by the National Board of Examination for medical students,” the ministry said in a statement. The ministry said that the decision has been taken in the “best interests of the students and to maintain the sanctity of the examination process”. “We stand for transparent, tamper-free and zero error examination. A panel has been formed on exam reforms, strict action has been taken against officials and the case has been handed over to CBI,” Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said. “Students’ interest will be safeguarded at any cost,” he said after a flurry of decisions amid litigation and protests in different parts of the country on the issue of alleged irregularities in entrance exams. The opposition hit out at the government, with the Congress alleging that the education system has been “ruined” under the Modi government. According to officials, NTA DG Subodh Kumar Singh has been put on “compulsory wait” in the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) till further orders. India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO) Chairman and Managing Director Pradeep Singh Kharola has been assigned additional charge of the NTA till the appointment of a regular incumbent. “Certain cases of alleged irregularities, cheating, impersonation and malpractices have been reported in NEET-UG which was conducted on May 5. “For transparency on the conduct of the examination process, it was decided after a review that the matter be handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for comprehensive investigation,” the Ministry of Education said announcing the late-night decision. Pradhan also asserted that anybody involved or responsible for any irregularity in NEET-UG will not be spared. Bihar Police on Friday night detained six more people from Jharkhand’s Deoghar district in connection with the alleged leak of NEET paper in the state, an official said. Its Economic Offences Unit last month arrested 13 people, including prime suspect Sikandar Yadavendu, in connection with the alleged paper leak. The EOU is also exploring the “possibility of conducting narco analysis and brain mapping tests” of the accused, sources said. They also indicated that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) might investigate the money laundering aspect. A fresh plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the CBI and the ED to investigate the alleged irregularities in the NEET-UG. The petition, filed by 10 students who had appeared for the exam, has also sought a direction to Bihar Police to expedite the investigation in the case and file a report before the apex court. The top court had earlier sought responses from the Centre, the NTA and others on a slew of petitions, including those seeking scrapping of the NEET-UG 2024 exam and a court-monitored probe. The apex court had also stayed further proceedings on similar pleas pending before different high courts. The Education Ministry notified a seven-member panel headed by former ISRO chief K Radhakrishnan to ensure transparent, smooth and fair conduct of examinations through NTA. The Centre has also operationalised a stringent law that aims to curb malpractices and irregularities in competitive examinations with provisions entailing a maximum jail term of 10 years and a fine of up to Rs 1 crore for offenders. Nearly four months after President Droupadi Murmu gave her assent to The Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024, the Personnel Ministry on Friday night notified the law. The examination was held on May 5 across 4,750 centres and around 24 lakh candidates appeared. The results were expected to be declared on June 14 but were announced on June 4. As many as 67 students scored a perfect 720, unprecedented in the NTA’s history, with six from a centre in Haryana’s Faridabad figuring in the list, raising suspicions about irregularities. There was also a controversy over grace marks awarded to students to make up for the loss of time at six centres. The Centre later told the apex court that the grace marks were being scrapped and these 1,563 students would be given an option of a retest. The NTA will on Sunday conduct the retest for these students. The NEET-UG examination is conducted by the NTA for admissions to MBBS, BDS, AYUSH and other related courses in government and private institutions across the country."

Extensive security operations in the region have revealed the Maoists’ cash flow linked to the use and circulation of fake currency in local markets. Police have found currency printers, ink, and notes of several denominations.

He said that the operation is still going on in the area. The official said that the dead bodies of the two terrorists could not be recovered on Saturday as they were lying close to the LoC. The security forces had launched an operation in the Gohallan area of the Uri sector on Saturday after noticing suspicious movement of two men near the LoC. The army has named it Operation Bajrang."

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk News18.com Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 19:43 IST New Delhi, India Arvind Kejriwal and special judge Niyay Bindu. (PTI File/X) Acting on the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) plea, the Delhi High Court on Friday stayed the bail granted by the trial court to Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal in the alleged money laundering case in the liquor policy scam. The now-paused order was passed by Rouse Avenue Court’s Special Judge Niyay Bindu on Thursday. Kejriwal and the AAP have been accused of receiving kickbacks of Rs 100 crore from the South Group, a cartel of politicians, businessmen and others to rig the Delhi liquor policy in favour of licencees. The money was allegedly used in the 2022 Goa assembly poll campaign. ALSO READ | Arvind Kejriwal Hearing LIVE: Delhi HC Reserves Order, Pauses Bail Granted By Trial Court The ED had arrested Kejriwal on March 21, shortly after Delhi High Court refused to grant him protection from arrest on his petition challenging summonses issued to him. On May 10, the Supreme Court had granted interim bail to Kejriwal till June 1 to campaign in Lok Sabha elections, saying he will have to surrender and go back to jail on June 2. He is in jail ever since. In the order granting relief to Kejriwal, which was made available on Friday, the vacation judge held that prima facie, his guilt was yet to be established. “It may be possible that some persons known to the applicant are having involvement in an offence….but the ED has failed to give any direct evidence against the applicant in respect of the proceeds of crime,” the judge said. She also questioned the ED’s silence on Kejriwal’s assertion that he was arrested in the money laundering case related to the alleged excise scam without having been named in the Central Bureau of Investigation’s First Information Report (FIR) or the ECIR registered by the anti-money laundering agency. Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) is ED’s version of an FIR. “This is also noticeable that ED is silent about the facts as to how the proceeds of crime have been utilized in Assembly Elections in Goa by AAP as, admittedly, after about two years, the bigger portion of the alleged amount remains to be traced out,” the judge said. Delhi High Court reserves #ArvindKejriwal 's bail orderNothing unusual in this, such things do happen. Remarks made against ED are damning: Ravi Srivastava, Political Analyst #AAP #DelhiLiqourScam #NationAt5 | @poonam_burde pic.twitter.com/5hs7AJyAgJ — News18 (@CNNnews18) June 21, 2024 The judge said the ED has failed to clarify how much time it will require to trace the complete money trail. “Meaning thereby that until and unless this exercise of tracing out the remaining amount gets completed by the ED, accused is supposed to remain behind bars that too without proper evidence against him. This is also not an acceptable submission of the ED,” the judge said. The maxim of law that every person must be presumed innocent until proven guilty seems to be not applicable in the given case in respect of the present accused, she said. The judge quoted Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of the US, to say, “It is better that 100 guilty persons should escape than an innocent person should suffer…This principle imposes a duty upon the court not only to prevent guilty individuals from escaping justice but also to ensure that no innocent should be punished. There have been thousands of cases where the accused underwent a long lasting trial and agony resulting from the same till the date they were acquitted by the court for being innocent. Unfortunately, the mental and physical agony of such person cannot be compensated in any manner whatsoever. If an accused undergoes the atrocities of the system till his innocence is discovered, he would never be able to conceive that justice has actually been done to him.” The judge said there are certain undisputed facts, as specified on behalf of the applicant, that in the month of July 2022, the material now with the ED was already available with it, but he was called only in August 2023, which shows the mala fide on the part of the central agency. “The probe agency has failed to answer this objection of the applicant,” the judge said. ALSO READ | ‘ED Doing Paper-Encounter’, Arvind Kejriwal Tells Delhi HC As Probe Agency Calls CM’s Bail Order ‘Perverse’ She also dismissed the ED’s argument that “investigation is an art and sometimes one accused is given lollipop of bail and pardon and induced with some assurance to make them tell the story behind the offence”. “If it is so, then any person can be implicated and kept behind bars by artistically procuring the material against him after artistically avoiding/ withdrawing exculpatory material from the record. This very scenario constrains the court to draw an inference against the investigating agency that it is not acting without bias,” the judge said. The judge noted that the Additional Solicitor General (ASG), appearing for the ED, talked about inducement to extract the truth against other accused involved in the matter. “But the effect of this submission goes to the conception that the complete truth cannot be revealed through the persons who have resiled from their previous statements. Rather, the complete truth shall be established on the basis of the incriminating material, if available on record which the investigating agency is under an obligation to procure in a legal manner by following the procedural aspects as well,” the judge said. अरविंद केजरीवाल जी की जमानत का पुख़्ता आधार है।मैं समझता हूँ कि High Court इस बात का संज्ञान ज़रूर लेगा कि Trial Court के आदेश में क्या-क्या बात लिखी हैं और अरविंद केजरीवाल जी को किस आधार पर जमानत मिली है। @SanjayAzadSln pic.twitter.com/ucV0fg44kS — AAP (@AamAadmiParty) June 21, 2024 The judge said the allegations against Kejriwal surfaced during subsequent statements of certain co-accused. She said it is also an admitted fact that he has not been summoned by the court after his arrest and is “lying in judicial custody at the instance of the ED on the pretext of the investigation being still on”. “On the prima facie basis, the guilt of the accused is yet to be established. In respect of the condition that he shall not involve in the offence after his release on bail, it is already undertaken so by the applicant in his application. Moreover, if bail is granted, the same shall be conditional which shall put the applicant under an obligation in this regard,” the judge said. She said it is also noticeable that in the cases under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), bail becomes an impossible task to obtain as on one pretext or the other, the investigating agency gives its own reasons, which puts the accused in a situation almost akin to a convict without any hope to be released from the gloomy atmosphere of jail. The judge had on Thursday ordered Kejriwal’s release on bail on a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh. It, however, imposed certain conditions on the AAP leader before granting him the relief, including that he will not try to hamper the investigation or influence the witnesses. The judge had also directed Kejriwal to appear before the court whenever required and to cooperate with the investigation. With PTI Inputs"

The case was registered on Saturday after the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) lodged a complaint against the influencer, following which she was booked under Section 295-A (deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any class) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

The SGPC, the apex gurdwara body suspended its three employees for not diligently performing their duties.

Please accept my sincere apologies,” she added."

    "article_content": "News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 13:50 IST New Delhi, India The high court on Friday paused Kejriwal's release after the trial court granted him bail on June 20. (PTI file) The Supreme Court on Monday fixed June 26 for hearing Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s plea against the Delhi High Court order putting an interim stay on his bail in the money laundering case linked to the alleged excise scam. The top court said, “If we pass an order now, we will be prejudging the issue.” A vacation bench of Justices Manoj Misra and SVN Bhatti said it would like to wait for the pronouncement of the high court order on the issue. Senior Advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for Kejriwal, sought vacating of the interim stay on the bail order. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S V Raju, appearing for the ED, opposed the plea of Kejriwal, and said the high court is about to pronounce the verdict on its stay application. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on March 21, could have walked out of Tihar jail on Friday last had the high court not granted the interim stay relief to the federal anti-money laundering agency. The high court had listed the plea for hearing on July 10. The court had said it was reserving the order for two-three days as it wanted to go through the entire case records. It also issued a notice to Kejriwal seeking his response to the ED’s plea challenging the trial court’s June 20 order by which he was granted bail. ASG Raju, appearing for the ED in the high court, had contended that the trial court’s order was “perverse”, “one-sided” and “wrong-sided” and that the findings were based on irrelevant facts. The relevant facts, he claimed, were not considered by the special judge. Seeking a stay on the trial court’s order, Raju had contended that the ED was not given adequate opportunity to argue its case. The ED’s application for stay was vehemently opposed by senior advocates Abhishek Singhvi and Vikram Chaudhari, representing Kejriwal. They had submitted that Article 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution does not exist for the ED for which the liberty of a person is figured low in priority. In its bail order, the trial court had held that prima facie, Kejriwal’s guilt was yet to be established and that the ED had failed to furnish direct evidence linking him to the proceeds of crime in the money laundering case. The excise policy was scrapped in 2022 after the Delhi lieutenant governor ordered a CBI probe into alleged irregularities and corruption involving its formulation and execution."

    "article_content": "Published By : Siddarth Sriram AFP Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 11:14 IST Germany FILE - Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader, File) Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann is anxious about players getting serious injuries on Sunday in Frankfurt on the slippery turf that was laid several months ago after NFL games in the stadium. Nagelsmann raised the risk of ACL injuries when Germany plays Switzerland needing to avoid defeat to confirm finishing top of Group A at the European Championship. The Waldstadion field in rainy Frankfurt cut up badly in two previous games at Euro 2024 — Belgium’s 1-0 loss to Slovakia then a 1-1 draw between England and Denmark, who played under a closed roof. “I’m not worried about the footballing aspect, more about the danger of injury to the players,” Nagelsmann said on Saturday in translated comments. “Players such as (Jude) Bellingham we saw had problems and they risked serious injury. If you slip you really risk getting injured,” the Germany coach said of the England star who had a subdued game on Thursday. Nagelsmann said he also noticed England midfielder Declan Rice also slipping “and there were some very risky situations.” It is not a new concern for Nagelsmann about a turf field that replaced a hybrid surface brought in for two NFL games seven months ago. In Frankfurt, the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Miami Dolphins one week before the Indianapolis Colts beat the New England Patriots. Turf was then restored for Eintracht Frankfurt games ahead of the winter, and the stadium also hosted the German national team in March, for a 2-1 win in a friendly against the Netherlands. That evening, Nagelsmann called the surface a “catastrophe,” and on Saturday said it “has not improved a lot. It’s a bit of a tricky situation.” Switzerland coach Murat Yakin made a joke of the subject when asked, because his players also had turf issues at their tournament training base in Stuttgart. A formal complaint to UEFA led to a new field being laid this week. “You’ve noticed we have trained for a week on a terrible training pitch,” Yakin said on Saturday, “and that could be beneficial for us.” The Frankfurt stadium is not yet halfway through its five-game Euro 2024 duty. It hosts Slovakia vs. Romania in a decisive group-stage game on Wednesday, and a round-of-16 game on July 1 likely involving Portugal. UEFA has a supply of turf fields in reserve, typically in the Netherlands, and has installed replacement fields in mid-tournament at Lille, France in 2016 and Basel, Switzerland in 2008.

Final positions in the six groups are still up for grabs which determine potential opponents in the knockout stage. There are four places available in the last 16 for the best third-place finishers, which could lead to a situation of one or more teams going through with two points while another could miss out despite getting four points but finishing fourth in their group. If teams are level on points, they will be split on head-to-head record, goal difference, then goals scored, then disciplinary points, then their qualifying ranking. – Germany are through and assured of a top two finish in the group. They can secure top spot if they do not lose to Switzerland. – Switzerland can qualify for the last 16 if they do not lose to Germany or Scotland fail to beat Hungary. They can win the group if they beat Germany. – Scotland will make it through with a win against Hungary and a Switzerland defeat by Germany, providing they overturn the goal difference disparity. – Hungary must beat Scotland to have a chance of reaching the last 16 on one of the best third place finishers. – Spain have reached the last 16 and will finish as group winners thanks to their win over second-placed Italy. – Italy must avoid defeat by Croatia to finish as runners-up in the group. They will be out if they lose and Albania beat Spain. – Albania can finish as runners-up if they beat Spain and Croatia beat Italy. They will be out if they lose and Croatia win. – Croatia can also finish as group runners-up if they beat Italy and Albania do not win against Spain. Croatia will be out if they draw and Albania do not lose. – England will be through if they do not lose to Slovenia or if Denmark fail to beat Serbia. England can top the group with a win or even a draw if Denmark do not win. England cannot finish lower than third. – If Denmark beat Serbia they will be through. If the Danes and Slovenia both draw, they will finish second and third via goal difference etc. Denmark will be out if they lose and Slovenia do not. – Slovenia can make the last 16 by beating England. They will top the group if they win and Denmark do not. If they win or draw and the result is matched by the Danes, they will be split on goal difference etc. – Serbia can also qualify by beating Denmark and if Slovenia do not win against England. Serbia will be out if they lose or if they draw and Slovenia do not lose. – The Netherlands will finish in the top two if they do not lose to Austria.

If France and the Dutch have the same result, they will be split on goal difference etc. – A win for Austria over the Dutch will give them a top two finish in the group. Austria can top the group if they win and France do not. – Poland are already eliminated and cannot reach the last 16. – For the first time in European Championship history, all four teams (Romania, Belgium, Slovakia and Ukraine) are level on three points after two games. All of them can finish in any position and each team can progress or be eliminated. – Portugal have secured their place in the last 16 with top spot in the group. – Turkey need to avoid losing against the Czech Republic to finish as group runners-up. – Czech Republic can finish second and qualify by beating Turkey. A draw may be enough but they will go out if they lose. – Georgia can progress as runners-up by beating Portugal and if Czech Republic also win against Turkey – they will also need to overturn the goal difference.

A post shared by TNT Sports (@tntsports) By the end of the match, it was hard to know what Cristiano Ronaldo was frustrated more about – failing to score for the second straight game at the European Championship or having to fend off repeated attempts for selfies by his adoring fans. In what proved to be a wild and potentially dangerous match for the five-time world player of the year, Ronaldo had no goals, one assist and no less than four selfie-seeking field invaders for company in Portugal’s chaotic 3-0 win over Turkey that secured his team a spot in Euro 2024’s round of 16. Ronaldo, one of the world’s most popular and well-known sport stars, was the centre of attention as always at Westfalenstadion. Just not how he might have expected. “That’s the price you pay for being so recognized in the world of football,” said Bernardo Silva, Ronaldo’s Portugal teammate. Making a record 27th appearance at the Euros, Ronaldo did get his first goal involvement of this tournament when he set up the third by Bruno Fernandes in the 55th minute with an unselfish pass across the face of the six-yard box after being played clean through. Perhaps he just wanted another record. This was his eighth assist at a European Championship, more than anyone else. ALSO READ | Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo Creates History With Assist Against Turkey in EURO 2024 “It was a pure moment of Portuguese football,” Portugal coach Roberto Martinez said in praise of Ronaldo, his captain. “It should be shown in every academy in Portugal and world football, because it showed that the team is the most important thing.” Then things got a bit silly — and potentially unsafe — for the former Real Madrid, Manchester United and Juventus striker. Ronaldo was fine posing for a photograph with a young boy who evaded stewards to get on the field in the 69th minute and whipped out his cell phone. That fan sprinted off before finally being grabbed and escorted away by security. ALSO WATCH | Young Cristiano Ronaldo Fan Dribbles Past Security at EURO 2024 After Invading Pitch to Snap Picture However, Ronaldo certainly wasn’t amused when two other fans with phones at the ready tried the same trick in the final few minutes of a game that flew out of control. He threw his arms up in disgust the first time and appeared to actively try to avoid the next one as he defended a corner. It wasn’t clear if those fans got their wish before being taken away. After the final whistle, there were more security breaches as a fan wearing a red Portugal jersey attempted to get close to Ronaldo while holding a phone. He was soon tackled to the ground. Then two more supporters were prevented from confronting Ronaldo as Portugal’s players walked off the field, having just come from saluting their law-abiding fans in the stands.

    "article_content": "Published By : Vivek Ganapathy Associated Press Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 16:53 IST Germany Luka Modric, Gianluigi Donnarumma. Defending champion Italy needs to avoid defeat against neighbouring Croatia in their final group game to ensure progress at the European Championship. Croatia can progress with a win, or by avoiding defeat as long as Albania does not beat group-winner Spain in the other Group B game at the same time. Kick-off is at 9 p.m. local time on Monday. Italy has three points after beating Albania 2-1 in its opening game before losing 1-0 to Spain, which is already assured of winning the group. Croatia lost to Spain 3-0 in its opening game, then drew with Albania 2-2 in their second game, leaving both Croatia and Albania with one point. Albania has the better goal difference. Though a draw will be enough for Italy’s progression, Luciano Spalletti’s team will be keen to impress after being thoroughly outclassed by Spain in its previous game. Italy only lost by a goal, but the Italian players spent most of the game chasing Spanish shadows and were saved embarrassment by captain and goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. Zlatko Dalic’s Croatia team is once again led by Real Madrid star Luka Modric, who is yet to score in his fifth tournament appearance. Italy lost in its previous and only game in Leipzig, a 1-0 defeat to East Germany in a friendly in April 1982. Many of the Croatian players have played in Italy, while Italy coach Luciano Spalletti is familiar with Marcelo Brozovic and Ivan Perisic from their time together at Inter Milan between 2017 and 2019. The now 35-year-old Perisic scored 55 goals in 254 games across stints with Inter, winning the Serie A title in 2021 and Coppa Italia the next season. Italy left-back Federico Dimarco is expected to miss the game with a right calf injury sustained in the loss against Spain. Dimarco featured in both of Italy’s games so far. Croatia will be without midfielder Nikola Vlacic, who is no longer with the squad because of an injury, while veteran defender Domagoj Vida missed Saturday’s training session with an ankle injury. Head to Head! Italy has a poor record against Croatia, winning only one of their previous nine meetings. Croatia won three, while there were five draws. The last three games all finished 1-1. Italy’s only win came in the first meeting between the countries, a friendly in Genoa in 1942 that yielded four goals for the home team. “I know the Italy coach. They will be well organized. It will be a tough match, but I believe we will rise to the challenge and come out victorious,” Croatia midfielder Mario Pasalic said ahead of the clash. “Croatia are strong. They have experience. In addition to Brozovic, they have many quality players and we will have to be careful. But we will have to play our game with our own strengths, and I’m sure we will cause them problems,” said Italian Matteo Darmian. Stay updated with the latest from Euro 2024 .

    "article_content": "Curated By : Vivek Ganapathy News18.com Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 19:40 IST Germany Arthur Theate, Romelu Lukaku. Belgium posted a 2-0 triumph over Romania in their Group E fixture at the RheinEnergieStadion on Sunday to get off the mark at the Euro 2024 with strikes from Youri Tielemans and Kevin De Bruyne giving the Red Devils their first points of the tournament. Belgian striker Romelu Lukaka had yet another goal chalked off for offside during the game, the third time in the ongoing continental showpiece that the 31-year-old has had his strike disallowed following the two goals he had ruled out for straying beyond the last defender. Defender Arthur Theate, however, wasn’t too worried about the striker’s disallowed strikes and felt it was only a matter of time before the forward nets for his side. “It’s probably not easy because it’s his third goal that’s disallowed, but I think it’s unlucky when you see the offside,” Theate told reporters. “It’s very, very hard to accept because it’s maybe one centimetre (offside), but I think he’s in a good mindset,” he revealed. He touched upon Lukaku’s importance in the squad and touted him to find the back of the net. “He’s very important for us, he creates a lot of chances, a lot of spaces, so if he carries on and keeps going like this, I’m sure he will score a lot of goals,” the 24-year-old added. Belgium opened their campaign with a shock 0-1 defeat to Slovakia to make things tricky for themselves. And for the first time in the history of the European tournament, all four teams in the group- Belgium, Slovakia, Romania and Ukraine- head into the final round of fixtures level at three points each. Belgium take on Ukraine in their remaining Group E clash, while Slovakia will face Romania on the same day. Theate acknowledged the position his side find themselves in but also suggested confidence ahead of their final group game as they look to emulate their most recent performance in order to claim a victory and secure passage into the Round of 16. “It’s not easy. We knew this when we lost the first game against Slovakia, we’re going to have to not lose anymore,” said Theate. “We won yesterday so it’s a great thing. Now we have to do the same thing on Wednesday. We just have to look at ourselves and do our job and then everything will be fine,” the stopper-back signed off.

    "article_content": "Published By : Vivek Ganapathy Associated Press Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 23:58 IST Germany Albania's Mirlind Daku, centre, controls the ball ahead Croatia's Martin Baturina during a Group B match between Croatia and Albania at the Euro 2024 soccer tournament in Hamburg, Germany, Wednesday, June 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Sunday Alamba) Albania player Mirlind Daku was banned on Sunday for two games after leading fans in nationalist chants at the European Championship, that UEFA said brought football into disrepute. Daku took a megaphone after Albania’s 2-2 draw with Croatia on Wednesday in Hamburg and joined in chanting slogans against Serbia and North Macedonia. The incidents and fallout from the game in Hamburg have been the most serious involving Balkan politics at a Euros with the most-ever teams from the region playing — and offering a stage for some fans to air its issues. It also has highlighted rifts in football between Albania and Serbia at a time when their football federations have tried to heal them by teaming up, despite opposition from many fans, in a bid to co-host the Under-21 Euros in 2027. On Sunday, UEFA said its disciplinary judges found Daku guilty of “failing to comply with the general principles of conduct, for violating the basic rules of decent conduct, for using sports events for manifestations of a non-sporting nature and for bringing the sport of football into disrepute.” UEFA also ordered the Albanian football federation to pay fines totalling 47,250 euros for incidents at the game where its fans chanted an anti-Serb slogan, reportedly “Kill the Serbs.” The Serbian football federation said it would quit the tournament if UEFA did not punish the incidents. On the field, Albania plays a decisive group-stage game on Monday against Spain. If Albania advances, Daku also would sit out the round of 16 game. Daku later apologized for his actions in a social media posting, as UEFA appointed an in-house investigator to study his “alleged inappropriate behaviour.” The 26-year-old forward began playing for Albania last year having used his right under FIFA rules to change his eligibility from Kosovo, the ethnic-Albanian former province of Serbia that declared independence 16 years ago. “For the time being, we are focused on tomorrow’s match. He knows he made a mistake, he apologized and everything ended there,” Albania captain Berat Djimsiti said of his teammate through a translator. He added: “I am not here to speak about the politics. This is a thing that UEFA has to take care of. In this moment, the main reason why we are here is to play a big game tomorrow.” UEFA had also announced charges against its member federations of both Albania and Croatia over “potential racist and/or discriminatory conduct” by fans on Wednesday. However, only Albania was fined for “transmitting provocative messages not fit for a sports event.” The Croatia federation was fined just 27,500 euros for fans lighting and throwing fireworks at the stadium. UEFA confirmed later Sunday that the racism aspect of the investigation continues. The Albanian football Federation, or FSHF, called on the fans to be “accountable and avoid incidents and riots.” “The FSHF invites fans and football lovers to support to the end the Albanian national team in this magical and historic path in Euro 2024 by showing citizenry and accountability through correct behaviour and by respecting the rules and the opponents,” said a statement. Albania has impressed at Euro 2024 in an opening 2-1 loss against Italy and then the 2-2 draw with Croatia. With three national teams at Euro 2024 from the former Yugoslavia — Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia — plus Kosovo’s neighbour Albania, fans have shown that their shared history in the brutal Balkans war of the 1990s and diplomatic issues since cannot easily be forgotten. Nationalist chants raised the hostility levels at Euro 2024 where provocative banners, such as flags with maps, were expected to bring politics into the 10 stadiums in Germany. Serbia and Albania each were fined by UEFA after their opening games for fans “transmitting a provocative message.” It cost them 10,000 euros each for a first offence. The Serbian fans’ banner about Kosovo had also led to a FIFA prosecution involving players at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Serbia considers Kosovo the cradle of its statehood and Christian Orthodox religion and is among several European countries that do not recognize its independence. In Germany last week, a television journalist from Kosovo had his credential cancelled by UEFA after making the two-handed Albanian eagle gesture while broadcasting pitch-side in front of Serbia fans. The Balkan entries at Euro 2024 could have been five had Bosnia-Herzegovina come through a qualifying playoff bracket in March won by Ukraine. UEFA’s president Aleksander Čeferin, a lawyer from Slovenia who grew up in the former Yugoslavia, had said while attending Serbia’s decisive qualifying game in November that he would “certainly like” as many teams from the region to qualify as possible. UEFA has a decision to make this year that could be very symbolic about the sport’s ability to unite, at a time when it blocks in its competition draw ceremonies any pairings of teams from Kosovo against Serbian or Bosnian opponents for security reasons. The Albania-Serbia candidacy to co-host the Under-21 Euros in 2027 is competing against Belgium and Turkey. UEFA’s executive committee — which includes a vice president from Albania, Armand Duka — is scheduled to vote on the 2027 host in December. Stay updated with the latest from Euro 2024 .

    "article_content": "Published By : Siddarth Sriram AFP Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 05:31 IST Germany Niclas Fullkrug for Germany at EURO 2024 (AFP) A stoppage-time header from Niclas Fuellkrug rescued a 1-1 draw for Germany against Switzerland on Sunday in Frankfurt, ensuring the Euro hosts finish top of Group A. The Swiss took the lead when Dan Ndoye scored from close range after 28 minutes to stun the home side. Germany took a series of risks late in the hope of an equaliser and veteran striker Fuellkrug delivered, heading home in the second minute of stoppage time. The result means Switzerland, rather than Germany, face a tougher last 16 assignment, setting up a potential meeting with holders Italy or 2018 World Cup finalists Croatia. The Germans look set to face second place in England’s Group C, which is currently Denmark. “I think the equaliser was deserved, as was the group win. We threw a lot forward at the end,” said Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann. “The cross was perfect. That was a nice moment for us as a team, that could be decisive. That changes the situation,” Fuellkrug told ARD. Heading into the match the hosts were optimistic they had turned the corner after almost a decade of disappointment at major tournaments, with two World Cup group stage exits bookending a Euros last 16 elimination. Led by an experienced midfield featuring captain Ilkay Gundogan and Toni Kroos, Germany beat both Scotland and Hungary in their first two matche. Germany were however caught off guard by Switzerland’s energy and failed to carve out many clear-cut chances. Despite Fuellkrug’s late rescue effort, Nagelsmann will have plenty to ponder after the stodgy performance. ‘Unjustified’ yellow card Nagelsmann decided to play the same starting XI for the third straight game despite already having made sure of a last 16 place. It was a decision he may regret when defender Jonathan Tah saw yellow, his second in the group stage, meaning he will miss Germany’s first knockout game. “The yellow card for Tah was unjustified, which is annoying. But we have enough quality to compensate for that,” Nagelsmann said. Pushed on by an optimistic and partisan home ground, Germany started brightly, carving out some half-chances after launching long balls over Switzerland’s midfield press. Robert Andrich looked to have given Germany the lead after 16 minutes when Yann Sommer made a meal of his long-range strike, which bounced past the goalkeeper and into the net. The goal was however overturned with VAR finding Jamal Musiala had committed a foul in the lead-up. The Swiss had been on the back foot early but took the lead on the 28-minute mark, taking advantage of some sloppy play from Musiala and Joshua Kimmich. Musiala lost the ball in his own half, sending Switzerland on the break. Kimmich won but then let go of possession, allowing Remo Freuler to find Ndoye who stuck out a leg and booted the ball into the net. It was the first time the hosts had trailed this tournament and the goal seemed to rattle Germany, who were increasingly hesitant in closing out the first half. Germany went on the attack in the second half as Nagelsmann made several offensive changes but the hosts had few clear chances against a Swiss side doggedly protecting their lead. Man City defender Manuel Akanji stretched out to block Kimmich at point-black range with 20 minutes remaining. Nagelsmann brought Fuellkrug from the bench with 14 minutes remaining and the Borussia Dortmund striker stepped up to the plate, heading in a cross from David Raum to send Germany back to the top of the group.

    "article_content": "Published By : Siddarth Sriram AFP Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 05:31 IST Germany Hungary's Barnabas Varga's horror collision during Hungary vs Scotland at EURO 2024 (AFP) Kevin Csoboth scored in the 10th minute of added time after a frightening injury to Barnabas Varga as Hungary snatched a 1-0 win over Scotland to stay in the hunt for a place in the last 16 of Euro 2024. A sickening incident led to Hungary striker Varga being stretchered off in front of his visibly shocked team-mates in the second half, but Csoboth’s late winner kept them alive in the tournament. The Hungarian Football Federation said shortly after Sunday’s match that Varga was in a “stable condition” in a hospital in Stuttgart. The episode brought back harrowing memories of Christian Eriksen’s collapse at Euro 2020, when Denmark players shielded him from the cameras and those in the stadium after he suffered a cardiac arrest. Csoboth dedicated the goal to Varga by holding up his stricken team-mate’s shirt during his celebration. “Of course we were fighting for him in the remaining 15-20 minutes. We wanted to win for him and we dedicate the win to him,” said Hungary attacker Roland Sallai. It was a bitter end to Scotland’s bid to reach the knockout phase of a major tournament for the first time as they were caught out pressing for a goal of their own right at the death. “It was always a one-goal game,” said Scotland coach Steve Clarke. “We didn’t manage to get the goal, we opened up at the end to try and get it.” Germany finished top of Group A after a 1-1 draw with Switzerland, who will go through as runners-up. Hungary must rely on other results if they are to advance as one of the best third-placed sides. Scotland came last with just a point as their wait for a first European Championship win since 1996 goes on. Clarke made one enforced change for Scotland as Scott McKenna replaced Kieran Tierney, who was stretchered off with a hamstring injury in the 1-1 draw with Switzerland. English-born Callum Styles got the nod in Hungary’s midfield, coming in after shaking off an injury, with Endre Botka also making his first appearance of the tournament on the right side of a back three. John McGinn revealed the team skipped their pre-match nap as thousands of Scotland supporters gathered outside the hotel, belting out songs in anticipation of what they hoped was a historic night. Hungary arrived at the Euros with increased expectations after a 14-match unbeaten run between November 2022 and March of this year. They also beat England twice in the last UEFA Nations League, as well as Germany away. But back-to-back defeats had punctured confidence and left Marco Rossi’s side needing to beat Scotland to keep alive their hopes of reaching the knockout rounds. Cagey opening Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn shovelled away a dipping drive from Bendeguz Bolla that bounced awkwardly in front of him, with Styles and then Willi Orban booked for cleaning out McGinn in a first half full of endeavour but limited in genuine chances. Che Adams’ dangerous clearance though led to a Hungary free-kick 25 yards out, which Dominik Szoboszlai clipped towards the far post with Orban’s header skimming the top of the crossbar. Szoboszlai, who shrugged off injury concerns after missing Hungary’s final team training session, hammered over a strike from distance, and it wasn’t until the 53rd minute that Scotland registered a shot. Scotland defended doggedly as Jack Hendry blocked Sallai’s attempt when he shifted in from the left before Marton Dardai headed over from a cross. A horrifying moment left Varga prone on his back in the Scotland area as he tried to head a free-kick goalwards while Gunn came flying out, with Anthony Ralston also crashing to the ground. It resulted in a long stoppage as medics set Varga in the recovery position before a sheet was draped around him as he was carried off on a stretcher. Scotland saw a penalty shout controversially turned down after Stuart Armstrong went down under a challenge from Orban, before the fourth official indicated 10 minutes of stoppage time. That sparked a desperate quest from both teams to find the winning goal. Gunn saved well from Andras Schafer and Szoboszlai, before Csoboth hit the post. Scotland defender Grant Hanley had a chance parried away by Peter Gulacsi, with Hungary racing up the other end and Csoboth steering home Sallai’s cutback to break Scottish hearts.

His appointment granted him the rank of cabinet minister and allowed him to work directly under Naveen Patnaik. He had earlier served as the private secretary to Naveen Patnaik. The Odisha government’s 5T governance charter was formerly spearheaded by VK Pandian as its secretary. A 2000-batch IAS officer, he commenced his public service as a sub-collector in Dharmagarh and later took on the roles of district collector in Mayurbhanj and Ganjam. Naveen Patnaik’s contributions have led to the Odisha government’s flagship programme, ‘Mo Sarkar.’"

Czech’s Adam Hlozek sent the ball flying inside the goalpost at 21:58 mins but it got ruled out as a handball. They lost the chance of taking the lead. Georges Mikautadze scored the first through a penalty shot in the added time of the first half. With it, he became the first player to score in the debutant EURO nation’s first two matches. But Patrik Schick pounced on the rebound at 58:02 mins, leveling the score at 1-1. Chytil had a great opportunity at 76:14 to take the match home but missed it. In the next Group F match between Turkey and Portugal, Bernardo Silva scored his first major international tournament goal in the 21st min as Portugal continued their EURO campaign success. Minutes later, at 28′, Turkey’s Samet Akaydin scores an own goal trying to pass back to the keeper, giving Ronaldo’s side a double lead. Then Ronaldo headed towards the goal, after receiving a threaded pass. He then crossed it to Bruno Fernandes who scored the third and last goal of the match in the 56th min."

    "article_content": "Published By : News Desk AFP Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 20:08 IST Palestine Medics identified the Palestinian as Mujahid Raed Abbadi, 24. (Image/X) Israeli troops tied a wounded Palestinian to a military vehicle during a raid in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, the army said Sunday, admitting that soldiers had violated operational procedures. Footage of the incident, which occurred on Saturday, has gone viral and shows a man strapped horizontally to the bonnet of a military jeep as it passes through a narrow alley. Medics identified the Palestinian as Mujahid Raed Abbadi, 24, who told AFP he lives in the Jenin refugee camp. The military said a Palestinian man was wounded during a “counterterrorism operation” to arrest wanted suspects in the area of Wadi Burqin, between the town of Burqin and Jenin. During an exchange of fire between troops and militants in Burqin’s Jabriyat neighbourhood, a Palestinian was wounded and apprehended, the military said in a statement. The statement referred to him as a “suspect”, but did not specify any accusations against Abbadi, who medics told AFP was being treated at Jenin’s Ibn Sina hospital, and not in Israeli custody. The military said: “In violation of orders and standard operating procedures, the suspect was taken by the forces while tied on top of a vehicle.” He was later transferred to the Palestinian Red Crescent for treatment, it said. “The conduct of the forces in the video of the incident does not conform to the values of the IDF (military),” the statement said. “The incident will be investigated and dealt with accordingly.” Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on the rights situation in the Palestinian territories, suggested the troops were using Abbadi to shield themselves from gunfire. “#HumanShielding in action”, Albanese wrote on social media platform X, sharing footage of the incident. At the hospital, Abbadi said he was hit and wounded as he stepped out of his uncle’s house in Jabriyat. “I tried to withdraw and get inside the house, but they started shooting”, hitting him in the hand, Abbadi told AFP in his hospital bed. ‘Stomped my head’ He said he fell to the ground in an area behind the military jeep and was hit once more, with a bullet penetrating his leg. According to Abbadi, rescuers or medics were unable to reach him for more than two hours as he lay on the ground. “I started crawling” trying to escape as fighting continued around him, he said, before the Israeli troops noticed him. “When they (the soldiers) arrived they stomped on my head and hit my face, my injured leg and hand,” Abbadi recalled. “They were laughing and playing while they hit me.” The soldiers lifted him and threw him on the ground before tying him to the bonnet of the jeep, he said. Bahaa Abu Hammad, the doctor treating Abbadi at Ibn Sina hospital, told AFP that “he has burns on his back from neck to lower back” from being tied to the military jeep in the scorching summer heat. Jenin has long been a stronghold for Palestinian militant groups, and the Israeli army routinely carries out raids in the city and an adjacent refugee camp. Violence in the West Bank, which had already surged before the Israel-Hamas war broke out on October 7, has only escalated since. At least 553 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by Israeli troops or settlers since the Gaza war broke out, according to Palestinian officials. Attacks by Palestinians have killed at least 14 Israelis in the West Bank over the same period, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. The Gaza Strip has been gripped by more than eight months of war since Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Militants took 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead. Israel’s military offensive on Gaza has since killed at least 37,598 people, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry."

He had been practising as a criminal defence lawyer in Brampton before entering politics. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh supported Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the 2021 Canadian Federal Election to form the government. As per the agreement between the Trudeau-led Liberal Party and Singh-led NDP, Trudeau’s Liberals pledged support to the left-leaning NDP on various issues. On June 23, 1985, a bomb exploded on Air India Flight 182, operating as ‘Kanishka’ while en route from Montreal to London. The blast killed all 329 people on board, most of them Canadians of Indian descent. The tragedy occurred 45 minutes before the aircraft was scheduled to land at London’s Heathrow Airport. The bombing was attributed to Sikh extremists seeking retribution for “Operation Bluestar”, a military operation by the Indian government aimed at flushing out militants from the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Punjab, in 1984. Members of the Sikh terrorist outfit Babbar Khalsa had targeted the flight."

The attacks took place in Dagestan’s largest city of Makhachkala and in the coastal city of Derbent. Russia’s Investigative Committee said it had opened criminal probes over “acts of terror”. Dagestan is a largely Muslim region of Russia bordering Georgia and Azerbaijan. “This evening in the cities of Derbent and Makhachkala armed attacks were carried out on two Orthodox churches, a synagogue and a police check-point,” said the National Antiterrorism Committee in a statement to RIA Novosti news agency. “As a result of the terrorist attacks, according to preliminary information, a priest from the Russian Orthodox Church and police officers were killed.” In all, six police officers had been killed and another 12 wounded in the attacks, the spokeswoman for Dagestan’s interior ministry, Gayana Gariyeva, told RIA Novosti. A 66-year-old priest was killed in Derbent, the press secretary of Dagestan’s interior ministry, Gariyeva told the agency. “The synagogue in Derbent is on fire,” the chairman of the public council of Russia’s Federation of Jewish Communities, Boruch Gorin wrote on Telegram. “It has not been possible to extinguish the fire. Two are killed: a policeman and a security guard”. He added: “The synagogue in Makhachkala has also been set on fire and burnt down. During the attack on the Orthodox church in Derbent, the priest’s throat was cut.” The leader of Dagestan, Sergei Melikov, wrote on Telegram: “This evening in Derbent and Makhachkala unknown (attackers) made attempts to destabilise the situation in society. “They were confronted by Dagestani police officers.”"

(@TylerACherry) The newly appointed White House communications official on Sunday apologised for contentious social media posts from his past, saying earlier posts do not reflect his current views. Tyler Cherry, former White House Interior Communications Director known for controversial remarks, has been promoted to Associate Communications Director in the Biden administration. Cherry’s apology came after his past comments on the Republican Party, US law enforcement agencies, and Gaza went viral. Past social media posts from when I was younger do not reflect my current views. Period. I support this Administration’s agenda – and will continue my communications work focused on our climate and environmental policies.— Tyler Cherry (@TylerACherry) June 23, 2024 “Past social media posts from when I was younger do not reflect my current views. Period. I support this Administration’s agenda – and will continue my communications work focused on our climate and environmental policies,” Cherry said in a post on Sunday. The newly appointed official earlier worked at the Interior Department for Secretary Deb Haaland. In a 2015 post shared by social media users on X, Cherry compared American law enforcement to ‘slave patrols’. “Praying for #Baltimore, but praying even harder for an end to a capitalistic police state motivated by explicit and implicit racial biases,” he wrote in a 2015 post on the killing of a Black man in Baltimore police custody. “Apt time to recall that the modern-day police system is a direct evolution of slave patrols and lynch mobs,” he said in a subsequent post. While some users described Cherry as a ‘far-left extremist,’ others asked, ‘Could you elaborate on what views are different and which of these past posts do not reflect your current views?’ It is important to note that the controversial posts from Cherry’s past are no longer visible on his current X account. Any posts on his account before April 2022 seem to have been deleted, preventing independent verification of circulating screenshots. The handle @TylerACherry seen in the screenshots corresponds to Cherry’s current X account name."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Abhishek Jha Edited By: Pragati Ratti News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 10:57 IST New Delhi, India Addressing the gathering, High Commissioner Verma said, “No government in the world should overlook the threat of terrorism emanating from its territories for political gains. After 39 years, justice remains elusive for the 329 victims of Air India Fligh-182 (Kanishka) bombing. Observing a memorial service to honour the victims of the heinous act of terrorism, in Ottawa, Indian High Commissioner in Canada Sanjay Verma said, “We still await for full and desired justice to the families of the victims of the bombing. No government in the world should overlook the threat of terrorism emanating from its territories for political gains.” The disastrous event of June 23, 1985, took 329 lives including 86 children when a bomb blew open a hole in the left aft fuselage of the Air India Flight 182, which was en route from Montreal to London. The aircraft, which bore the name ‘Kanishka’, was blown apart, falling approximately 31,000 feet below into the Atlantic Ocean off the south-west coast of Ireland. All 329 people on board were killed, including 268 Canadian citizens, 24 Indian citizens, and 37 citizens of the United Kingdom. The majority of the victims were of Indian descent. The bombing was orchestrated by Sikh extremists based in Canada. Speaking of the incident, Verma said that the act of terrorism was not just an attack on the passengers and crew of Flight 182 but also an assault on the values of tolerance, multiculturalism, and international cooperation. “The victims were not only Canadians, Indians, or British citizens; they were global citizens — each with dreams, aspirations, and loved ones left behind to grieve an unimaginable loss,” he said. The Air India Bombing remains one of the deadliest incidents of terrorism. Ironically, the perpetrators of the deadly terrorist act largely went unpunished as the investigators in the case never found out who all were behind this crime. Inderjit Singh Reyat, a Canadian Sikh, was the only person convicted in the bombing. He pleaded guilty in 2003 to manslaughter for assembling the bombs and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The investigation into the 1985 bombing was led by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), with assistance from international agencies such as the FBI and Irish police. Days before the 39th anniversary of the bombing, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) issued a statement saying that, “investigative efforts remain active and ongoing” in the Kanishka bombing case. “We must never forget those innocent lives lost to this tragedy and other acts of terrorism,” said the statement from Dave Teboul, Pacific Region Commander, Federal Policing RCMP. The Khalistani elements, which have crimes like the Kanishka bombing in their name, have again become active in the social and political landscape of Canada. This has seen a significant surge in the last few years as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has joined hands with new political partners who provide necessary numbers in the parliament for the Trudeau government to remain afloat. One of his alliance partners, New Democratic Party (NDP) and its leader Jagmeet Singh Dhaliwal, have been notorious for backing Khalistani elements in Canada. Understandably, the Trudeau government’s oversight on the acts of vandalism, threat and intimidation to Indian community members and even Indian diplomats in Canada seems more like a political compulsion. Nevertheless, the cost that the Canadian Prime Minister is paying to remain in power by making an alliance with extremist elements may totally boomerang for Canadian society in the long run."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Ankur Sharma News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 13:26 IST New Delhi, India The Israel government said it will help make CCTVs hostile for terror outfits. Private cameras installed at residences and private spaces by civilians became the biggest tool for Hamas, denting the preparation of defence forces and giving Israel the biggest lesson from the digital world. Smart houses became a tool for Hamas to generate information which was used by terror outfits. According to the Israeli government, before October 7 last year, Hamas not only got access to CCTV cameras installed all over the city by civilians, but also managed to control billboards with messages. The government has said that all cyberattacks had active involvement from Iran and Hezbollah. Gaby Portnoy, Director General of Israel National Cyber Directorate (INCD), said the government had inputs about such activities, but Hamas surprised them with the gravity of the cyber attack. “We had enough information about October 7, but they succeeded in surprising us,” Portnoy told News18 in Tel Aviv. Portnoy has served in a series of senior positions, including the Head of Operations in the Intelligence Corps, commander of Unit 9900, and Head of Planning TKINA and Budgets in the Intelligence Corps before joining as DG INCD. Before executing the October 7 massacre, where over 360 people were killed during a music festival, Hamas, the terror organisation, managed get access to CCTVs installed at various residences and shops. Smart houses equipped with technology faced a cyber attack. Officials involved in protecting cyber infrastructure of Israel said that Hamas connected the information gathered through these smart houses and CCTV footages to generate inputs before the attack. Hamas also got access to billboards and started pushing messages which were pulled down by Israel cyber security agency INCD. “Hamas attacked smart houses and billboards. Hamas collected private information through CCTVs. Till date, Israel has faced 1,992 potential cyber attacks,” Portnoy told News18. The DG of top cyber security agency also said that all cyber attack groups acting on behalf of Iran and Hezbollah held relentless assaults against Israel. The DG cautioned against the potential repercussions of AI-empowered influence campaigns, stressing the risks to digital trust and functional continuity in an era where loss of trust can be deeply damaging for governments and digital services. Just after the October attack, the analysis showed how Hamas had so much information. Immediately, the Israel Government, in a first, controlled the cameras and pulled them down to avoid further usage to track movements of Israeli defence forces or to collect any other information. After the October attack, Israel introduced a new law and cleared it as well, which gave the Israeli Army and security services the access to private security cameras without the knowledge of the owner. The Israel government said it will help make CCTVs hostile for terror outfits. Consequently, the IDF and the Shin Bet will be able to get access to private security cameras without requiring any permission from court."

(AFP) Ahead of the November presidential polls, all eyes are on former US President Donald Trump as speculation grows over his potential choice for vice president in a highly anticipated rematch against incumbent Joe Biden. Vice-presidential candidates are selected to complement the presidential nominee demographically, ideologically, and geographically. Trump chose Mike Pence in 2016 as his running mate, but the dynamics for the 2024 election cycle may shift with Trump considering former presidential candidate and Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. If you want to seal the border, Vote Trump.If you want to restore law and order in this country, Vote Trump. If you want to defeat the deep state, Vote Trump. If you want to fight inflation, Vote Trump. If you want to revive national pride in this country, Vote Trump.… pic.twitter.com/rgMlUfwgi7 — Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) June 18, 2024 Ramaswamy, who withdrew from the presidential race, has actively campaigned for Trump. Meanwhile, the former US President’s admiration for Ramaswamy has also been evident in recent remarks. Initially dismissive of Ramaswamy’s potential as a vice-presidential pick earlier this year, Trump’s tone shifted during a rally in Wisconsin. The presumptive Republican nominee praised Ramaswamy as a “smart guy” capable of effectively managing his administration. While stopping short of confirming Ramaswamy as his VP choice, Trump hinted at his inclusion in some capacity, stating, “If I gave it to Vivek to do, he’d pull it off.” Ramaswamy reciprocated Trump’s sentiments, likening him to “the George Washington of our day.” The endorsement has fueled widespread speculation and public discourse, with social media platforms buzzing over a recent video purportedly showing Trump’s private jet departing Cleveland amid secretive VP discussions. This could very well be fake news but the claim is that Trump was in Ohio a few days ago to ask Vivek Ramaswamy to be his VP. I would be really happy if this turns out to be his pick. pic.twitter.com/OsfmRXBkfq — Clint Russell (@LibertyLockPod) June 23, 2024 One vocal supporter wrote on X, “If he’s VP I am all in on Trump, unabashedly. If in wrong, I’ll eat that crow when everything goes to shiit. But having his influence in the ear of Trump along with a libertarian in a good dept (DOE is what Angela was saying) is a absolute BANGER of a start. That would give me.” Another said, “Vivek is the only real choice. The establishment wants anyone else but him. He hasn’t been corrupted by Washington and can’t be bought.” Yet another said, “I’m sure they considered that the jet would be watched and could have reached out to him without anyone knowing. If this trip was to meet with Vivek, I’m excited about the future.” Amid the speculation, a spokesperson for Ramaswamy acknowledged the media buzz but underscored his focus on ensuring Trump’s re-election to advance the “America First” agenda."

It added that the visit marks the ”continuation of high-level contact between the two countries”. “Last year, we have also witnessed important milestones in our bilateral relations like the implementation of a local currency trade settlement agreement, the launch of UAE’s domestic credit/debit card based on India’s RuPay card stack, the setting up of a campus of IIT Delhi in Abu Dhabi, fintech collaboration, and commencement of work on IMEEC, among others,” it said. Ahead of his day-long visit to Abu Dhabi, the MEA said that the visit would provide an opportunity to review the entire spectrum of comprehensive strategic partnership between India and the UAE as well as regional and global developments. “During the visit, the External Affairs Minister will have a meeting with his UAE counterpart on wide-ranging issues of the partnership,” the MEA said in a statement. About a 3.5-million-strong and vibrant Indian community forms the largest expatriate group in the UAE. Both countries signed a landmark comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA) in February 2022 to boost economic engagement."

All terrorist activities should be met with exemplary legal and social actions before they start harming the larger humanity,” the Indian High Commissioner said during his address, in an apparent rebuke of the Canadian government’s stance on pro-Khalistan activities in the country.

In an address to the parliament, Chandra Arya cautioned about the enduring presence of Khalistani ideology within Canada, citing recent incidents that have sparked concerns among Hindu Canadians. During his speech, he condemned the ‘cowardly act of terror’ orchestrated by Canadian-based Khalistani extremists, labeling it the deadliest mass killing in the country’s history. Family members and friends of the victims, Canadian government officials, including Royal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner, Ireland envoy and more than 150 members of the Indo-Canadian community attended the solemn occasion, the High Commission said. “India shares the sorrow and pain of the victims’ near & dear ones. India stands at the forefront of countering the menace of terrorism and works closely with all nations to tackle this global threat,” it said. The Montreal-New Delhi Air India ‘Kanishka’ Flight 182 exploded 45 minutes before it was supposed to land at London’s Heathrow Airport on June 23, 1985, killing all 329 people on board, most of them Canadians of Indian descent. The bombing was blamed on Sikh militants in retaliation to ‘Operation Bluestar’ to flush out militants from the Golden Temple in 1984. The Indian mission in Toronto also marked the day. “Consul General Siddhartha Nath laid a wreath at the Air India 182 memorial, Humber Park, Etobicoke in solemn remembrance of the 329 victims of the terrorist bombing of AI 182 on this day, 39 years ago,” the Consulate General of India in Toronto posted on X along with a photograph. In another post on X, the mission said the Consul General also attended the memorial service held at Queen’s Park Toronto for the victims and met with the bereaved families. “In his remarks he highlighted the importance of unified global efforts to combat terrorism and standing firm against its glorification,” it said, sharing a series of photographs. Today marks the 39th anniversary of one of the worst acts of terrorism in history.Pay my homage to the memory of the 329 victims of AI 182 ‘Kanishka’ who were killed this day in 1985.

Jaishankar (@DrSJaishankar) June 23, 2024 On Sunday, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in a post on X paid his homage to the memory of the 329 victims of AI 182 ‘Kanishka’ who were killed on this day in 1985. “Today marks the 39th anniversary of one of the worst acts of terrorism in history,” he said. “My thoughts are with their families. The anniversary is a reminder why terrorism should never be tolerated,” Jaishankar wrote. On Friday, the Canadian police said the investigations into the bombing of the Air India Flight 182 remain “active and ongoing”, terming it the “longest” and one of the “most complex domestic terrorism” probes. In a statement, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Assistant Commissioner David Teboul called the bombing the “greatest terror-related loss of life involving and affecting Canadians” in the country’s history as he offered “deepest sympathies, understanding and support to the families of the victims”."

(Image: AFP) In a latest development to the alleged human trafficking charges row against Britain’s wealthiest family, the Hindujas, four of the family members on Sunday claimed that they had never been imprisoned, found guilty, sentenced, or even detained. The members of the Hinduja family, Prakash Hinduja, 78, and his spouse Kamal Hinduja, 75 along with their son Ajay, 56, and his spouse Namrata, 50, were charged with “usury” for allegedly exploiting their immigrant employees by paying them a meagre salary According to claims made by a representative of the Hindujas, the family members have not been put in jail and that the accusations of human trafficking against them have been removed. In the statement, the spokesperson said, “The four Swiss-national members of the Hinduja Family, Kamal and Prakash Hinduja, Namrata and Ajay Hinduja, have not been subjected to any imprisonment, conviction, sentence or detention.” “Per Swiss law procedures, the lower court’s judgment is rendered ineffective and inoperative as the presumption of innocence is paramount until and unless a final judgment by the highest adjudicating authority is enforced. The most serious of the charges, human trafficking, against them were completely dismissed by the court yesterday,” the statement further read. “It may be noted that the case has no complainants left anymore and they had declared in the court that they were led into signing statements that they didn’t even understand. They had neither intended to nor initiated such proceedings. All of them further testified that the four Hinduja family members treated them with ‘respect, dignity and like family’. The four family members have full faith in the Swiss judicial process and remain confident that the truth will prevail,” it added. Earlier, the Britain’s wealthiest family, the Hindujas said they are “appalled” by a Swiss court’s ruling of jail terms for some members and have filed an appeal in a higher court challenging the verdict finding them guilty of exploiting vulnerable domestic workers from India employed at their villa in Geneva."

(AFP Photo) Saudi Arabia said Sunday that more than 1,300 pilgrims died during the Hajj pilgrimage, which occurred amid intense heat, with most of the deceased lacking official permits. The deceased came from over 10 countries, including the United States, Indonesia and India, with some governments still updating their toll. The tragic figure includes 98 Indian nationals who died of “natural causes” during the pilgrimage. “This year, 175,000 Indians have already visited Hajj. So far, we have lost 98 of our citizens. These deaths occurred due to natural illness, chronic illness, and old age. On the day of Arafat, six Indians died, and four died in accidents,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said during a press conference last week. The cause of death in most cases was heat-related. Temperatures in Mecca this year climbed as high as 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit), according to Saudi Arabia’s national meteorological centre. Riyadh had not publicly commented on the deaths or provided its own toll until Sunday. On Friday, however, a senior Saudi official defended Riyadh’s response, saying: “The state did not fail, but there was a misjudgement on the part of people who did not appreciate the risks.” The Saudi health minister, Fahd Al-Jalajel, on Sunday described management of the hajj this year as “successful”, SPA reported. He said the health system “provided more than 465,000 specialised treatment services, including 141,000 services to those who didn’t obtain official authorisation to perform hajj,” according to SPA, which summarised an interview he gave to the state-affiliated Al-Ekhbariya channel. Jalajel did not specify how many deaths Saudi officials attributed to heat. “The health system addressed numerous cases of heat stress this year, with some individuals still under care,” SPA reported. “Among the deceased were several elderly and chronically ill individuals.” The hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam that all Muslims with the means must complete at least once in their lives. Saudi officials have said 1.8 million pilgrims took part this year, a similar number to last year, and that 1.6 million came from abroad. For the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer. The timing of the hajj moves forward about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions. Hajj permits are allocated to countries on a quota system and distributed to individuals by lottery. Even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs spur many to attempt the hajj without a permit, though they risk arrest and deportation if caught. Saudi authorities said before the hajj that they had cleared hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca. But the Saudi official on Friday said around 400,000 unregistered pilgrims took part, and that “almost all of them (were) from one nationality”, an apparent reference to Egypt. (With agency inputs)"

A view shows (Right) plumes of smoke rising, in Derbent. Six gunmen opened fire at a synagogue, an Orthodox church and a police post in attacks across two cities in Russia’s Dagestan on Sunday, killing an Orthodox priest and at least 15 police officers. The attacks across the cities of Makhachkala and Derbent in the country’s Russia’s Northern Caucasus came three months after 145 people were killed in an attack claimed by the Islamic State on a concert hall near Moscow. “This is a day of tragedy day for Dagestan and the whole country,” Sergei Melikov, governor of the Dagestan region, said in a video published early on Monday on the Telegram messaging app. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks in the volatile North Caucasus region. “We understand who is behind the organisation of the terrorist attacks and what goal they pursued,” Melikov said. Russia’s state media cited law enforcement as saying that among the attackers had been two sons of the head of central Dagestan’s Sergokala district, who it said had been detained by investigators. Melikov said that among the dead, in addition to the police officers, were several civilians, including an Orthodox priest who worked in Derbent.

Russian state news agencies cited the National Anti-Terrorist Committee as saying that five of the gunmen had been killed. June 24-26 have been declared days of mourning in Dagestan, Melikov said, with flags lowered to half-staff and all entertainment events cancelled. The Muslim-majority region, once plagued by an Islamist insurgency spilling over from neighboring Chechnya in the 2000s, saw Russian security forces aggressively combating extremists. Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) declared in 2017 that it had defeated the insurgency there. The agencies reported exchanges of gunfire in the centre of Makhachkala. They cited the interior ministry as saying that exits from the Caspian Sea port of around 600,000 had been closed, and that conspirators who were still at large may yet attempt to flee the city. Some 125 kilometres south of Makhachkala, gunmen attacked a synagogue and a church in Derbent, home to an ancient Jewish community and a UNESCO World Heritage site. Authorities were quoted as saying that both the synagogue and church were ablaze, and that two attackers had been killed. In Israel, the Foreign Ministry said the synagogue in Derbent had been burned to the ground and shots had been fired at a second synagogue in Makhachkala. The statement said it was believed there were no worshippers in the synagogue at the time. (With agency inputs)"

The blast killed all 329 people on board, most of them Canadians of Indian descent.

It is unfortunate that such actions are allowed to be routine on many occasions in Canada,” the statement read, in an apparent reference to the Canadian government’s inaction amid growing Khalistan activities in the country. Amid increasing anti-India activity in the country, a Canadian journalist slammed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and highlighted the “moral failures” of his government. “I don’t think Trudeau really needs a reason to do the wrong thing. It is sort of a moral compulsion at this point. He was praised by Hamas, Churches are being burned down and he supported that. It is a confluence of his catastrophic moral failures,” Daniel Bordman told the news agency ANI. #WATCH | Canadian journalist Daniel Bordman says, ” I don’t think Trudeau really needs a reason to do the wrong thing.

He noted growing Canadian apprehension about these issues, viewing Khalistani elements as exacerbating societal tensions. “Initially, a lot of people are afraid, now a lot of Sikhs are very brave and, you know, when you start criticizing Khalistan, you know, the first.” “People who will, like, offer you a platform sometimes or come to help you out. A lot of them are Sikhs themselves who see this as, like, their duty. But we have a lot of crazy Gurdwaras in our country that has been infiltrated by the Khalistanis,” he said while adding that “Canadians are starting to get tired of this.”"

(Image: AP Photo) A Muslim mob in northwestern Pakistan on Thursday broke into a police station, snatched a man who was held there and then lynched him over allegations that he had desecrated Islam’s holy book, the Quran. The attackers also torched the station in Madyan, a town in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and burned police vehicles parked there, according to local police official Rahim Ullah. The slain man, Mohammad Ismail, was a tourist who was staying at a hotel in the town when some locals turned on him and accused him of blasphemy. Ullah said police officers took the man to the station for his protection but the mob swelled and pursued them. The mob then attacked the station, snatched Ismail, beat him to death and then burned his body and left it on the road. Additional police forces have arrived in Madyan to bring the situation under control, Ullah said. Police on Friday registered a case against hundreds of people who attacked a police station and killed the man. Khan said Ismail was being questioned by police when the mob attacked the police station and clashed with officers. Police have not yet arrested any of the attackers, Khan said. Attacks on people accused of blasphemy are common in this conservative Islamic nation where charges of blasphemy can carry the death sentence. International and national rights groups say blasphemy accusations have often been used to intimidate religious minorities and settle personal scores. Last month, a mob in Pakistan’s eastern Punjab province attacked a Christian man, Nazir Masih, 72, after accusing him of desecrating pages of Quran. He later died at a hospital."

(Image: Reuters/AFP) Britain’s wealthiest family, the Hindujas, have said they are “appalled” by a Swiss court’s ruling of jail terms for some members and have filed an appeal in a higher court challenging the verdict finding them guilty of exploiting vulnerable domestic workers from India employed at their villa in Geneva. A spokesperson for the affected family members, Kamal and Prakash Hinduja and their son Ajay and his wife Namrata – who are all Swiss nationals, pointed out on Saturday that neither of them have been subjected to any “imprisonment, conviction, sentence or detention.” “Per Swiss law procedures, the lower court’s judgement is rendered ineffective and inoperative as the presumption of innocence is paramount until and unless a final judgment by the highest adjudicating authority is enforced,” the family’s spokesperson said. “It may be noted that the case has no complainants left anymore and they had declared in the court that they were led into signing statements that they didn’t even understand. They had neither intended to nor initiated such proceedings. All of them further testified that the four Hinduja Family Members treated them with ‘respect, dignity and like family’,” the spokesperson added. Earlier on Friday, in a statement issued on behalf of the family by their lawyers from Switzerland stressed their clients had been acquitted of all human trafficking charges. They also dismissed media reports that any members of the family faced detention after court reports from Geneva said the four were sentenced to between four and four-and-a-half years in prison. “Our clients have been acquitted of all human trafficking charges. We are appalled and disappointed by the rest of the decision made in this court of first instance, and we have, of course, filed an appeal to the higher court, thereby making this part of the judgement not effective,” reads the statement signed by lawyers Yael Hayat and Robert Assael and Roman Jordan. “Under Swiss law, the presumption of innocence is paramount till a final judgement by the highest adjudicating authority is enforced. Contrary to some media reports, there is no effective detention for any members of the family,” they said. The lawyers also pointed out that “it should also be recalled that the plaintiffs in this case had withdrawn their respective complaints after declaring to the court that they had never intended to be involved in such proceedings.” “The family has full faith in the judicial process and remains confident that the truth will prevail,” they conclude. The statements follow a hearing in the Swiss city of Geneva after prosecutors opened the case for alleged illegal activity, including exploitation, human trafficking and violation of Switzerland’s labour laws. The family members were accused of seizing the workers’ passports, barring them from leaving the villa and forcing them to work very long hours for a pittance in Switzerland, among other things. Some workers allegedly spoke only Hindi and were paid their wages in rupees in banks back in India that they could not access. During the trial, prosecutors alleged the family spent more on their dog than on their servants. The family’s legal team had countered the allegations and told the court the staff were treated respectfully and provided with accommodation. According to The Sunday Times Rich List’ released last month, the UK-based Hinduja family once again emerged as the country’s richest, with wealth estimated at around GBP 37.196 billion. They saw this tally increase over the previous year in the wake of the opening of the brand-new luxury OWO Raffles Hotel in the heart of London. The UK-based family’s group of companies, headed by chairman G P Hinduja, operates in 48 countries and across several sectors – automotive, oil and specialty chemicals, banking and finance, IT, cyber security, healthcare, trading, infrastructure project development, media and entertainment, power, and real estate."

(AP file photo) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday a row with the United States over weapons delays relating to the Gaza war would be resolved soon, amid simmering tensions between the allies. “About four months ago, there was a dramatic drop in the supply of armaments arriving from the US to Israel. We got all sorts of explanations, but… the basic situation didn’t change,” he told a cabinet meeting. “In light of what I have heard in the last day, I hope and believe that this issue will be resolved in the near future,” he added. He said top Israeli officials lobbied their US counterparts at “the highest levels… at all levels” for speedier weapons deliveries. “After months of no change in this situation, I decided to give it a public expression,” he said. Netanyahu irked Washington with a video statement earlier this week accusing it of “withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel”. US officials have said they were not aware of what Netanyahu was referring to. Netanyahu’s latest comments came as Defence Minister Yoav Gallant flew to Washington for talks about the Gaza war. On Thursday, the prime minister said Israel needed American ammunition to fight a “war for its existence” as it battles Hamas militants in Gaza and trades fire with Lebanese Hezbollah on its northern border. Washington is Israel’s main military backer, but the White House has voiced frustration over the rising civilian death toll in Gaza, where Israel has been fighting Hamas militants for more than eight months."

(Reuters File Photo) Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to skip the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Kazakhstan next month, according to sources familiar with the matter. Modi has decided not to travel to Kazakhstan’s capital, Astana, for the summit-level talks scheduled on July 3-4. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar instead is set to represent India at the SCO meeting, which will witness the attendance of leaders from China, Russia, and Pakistan. The Prime Minister’s decision not to attend the SCO summit in the central Asian country next month is attributed to the upcoming Parliament session, scheduled from June 24 to July 3. During this session, key events such as the Speaker’s election and the President’s address to both Houses are planned. PM Modi’s presence is anticipated for the debate on the motion of thanks to the President in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, scheduled between July 2 and 4. Originally formed in 2001 by Russia and China, the SCO is a regional organization focused on security and economic cooperation across Eurasia. Its full members include Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India, and Pakistan, with Iran and Belarus set to join this year. The meeting hosted by Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev is expected to include Russia’s Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping. On Friday, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal was asked about India’s participation in the SCO. In response, he said that the details of the visit were not yet finalised. Last year’s summit meeting was hosted virtually by PM Modi. The SCO meeting marked India’s first such summit as the host."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Rohit News18.com Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 12:02 IST New Delhi, India An officer watches as Irish sailors and rescue workers carry ashore the body of one of the 329 victims of the Air India jumbo jet which crashed in the Atlantic Ocean near Cork, Ireland June 24, 1985. (Reuters) External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Sunday paid tribute to the victims of the Air India Flight 182 ‘Kanishka’ bombing, in which 329 people lost their lives almost four decades ago. The Montreal-New Delhi Air India ‘Kanishka’ Flight 182 exploded before it was slated to land at London’s Heathrow Airport on June 23, 1985. The blast killed all 329 people on board, most of them Canadians of Indian descent. In a post on X, Jaishankar said, “The anniversary is a reminder why terrorism should never be tolerated.” On June 23, 1985, Air India Flight 182, operating as ‘Kanishka’, was blown up by a bomb mid-air while en route from Montreal to London. The explosion claimed the lives of all 329 passengers and crew aboard, making it one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Canada’s history. The tragedy occurred 45 minutes before the aircraft was scheduled to land at London’s Heathrow Airport. A bomb, concealed in a suitcase checked into cargo during a stopover in Vancouver, exploded above the Atlantic Ocean in Irish airspace. The explosion happened as Air India Flight 182 was cruising at an altitude of 31,000 feet. According to BBC, only 131 bodies were retrieved from the sea. About an hour before Air India flight 182 was downed, a bomb detonated inside Tokyo’s Narita airport terminal. The explosive had been placed in a bag and checked onto a Canadian Pacific Airlines flight from Vancouver, destined for Air India Flight 301 bound for Bangkok. The blast occurred during the transfer to the aircraft at Narita, resulting in the deaths of two Japanese baggage handlers. Investigations linked both bombings collectively termed the “Kanishka case.” The bombing was attributed to Sikh extremists seeking retribution for “Operation Bluestar”, a military operation by the Indian government aimed at flushing out militants from the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Punjab, in 1984. Members of the Sikh terrorist outfit Babbar Khalsa had targeted the flight. In the aftermath of the bombing, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) launched an extensive investigation, which has been described as one of the longest and most complex domestic terrorism probes in Canada’s history. Investigations into the bombing of the Air India Flight 182 remain “active and ongoing”, the Canadian police said this week, ahead of the deadly bombing’s 39th-anniversary memorial. In a statement on Friday, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul called the bombing the “greatest terror-related loss of life involving and affecting Canadians” in the country’s history as he offered “deepest sympathies, understanding and support to the families of the victims”. “The Air India investigation is the longest and certainly one of the most complex domestic terrorism investigations that RCMP has undertaken in our history,” Teboul said. “Our investigative efforts remain active and ongoing,” he said. Asserting that the impacts of the bombing “have not diminished with time” he said that the trauma it caused has impacted generations. Months after the Air India explosion, Talwinder Singh Parmar, leader of the Babbar Khalsa, and Inderjit Singh Reyat, an electrician, were arrested by the RCMP. Parmar, previously sought by India for extradition in the early 1980s, was released due to a “lack of evidence”. Investigators later concluded Parmar orchestrated the attack, confirmed when he was killed by Indian police in 1992. In 2000, Ripudaman Singh Malik, a prominent Vancouver businessman, and Ajaib Singh Bagri, a British Columbia mill worker, faced charges including mass murder and conspiracy. However, a lengthy trial concluded in 2005 with their acquittal, citing errors in facts and witness credibility issues. The verdict left victims’ families devastated. Reyat, meanwhile, stood as the sole convicted individual linked to the aviation terror attack. Initially jailed in the UK in 1991 for his role in the Tokyo bombing, he later pleaded guilty to manslaughter in connection with Flight 182 in 2003, resulting in an additional Canadian prison sentence. His subsequent conviction for perjury during Malik and Bagri’s trial led to further incarceration. Each year, on the anniversary of the bombing, memorials are held across Canada to honor the memories of those who perished aboard Flight 182. Cities like Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, and Ottawa host ceremonies to remember the victims and offer solace to their families and friends. This year, the Consulate General of India has planned a memorial service to mark the anniversary of the bombing. “India stands at the forefront of countering the menace of terrorism and works closely with all nations to tackle this global threat,” the Consulate General of India in Vancouver posted on X on Tuesday. “23 June 2024 marks the 39th Anniversary of the cowardly terrorist bombing of Air India flight 182 (Kanishka), in which 329 innocent victims, including 86 children, lost their lives in one of the most heinous terror-related air disasters in the history of civil aviation,” it said. The memorial is scheduled on June 23 at the Air India Memorial at Stanley Park’s Ceperley Playground area in Vancouver."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Oliver Fredrick Edited By: Apoorva Misra News18.com Last Updated: May 10, 2024, 16:11 IST Kanpur, India The Kanpur parliamentary constituency, comprising Govind Nagar, Sisamau, Arya Nagar, Kidwai Nagar, and Kanpur Cantt assembly seats, holds significant political importance in Uttar Pradesh. (News18) This May 13, when Kanpur votes in the Lok Sabha Election 2024, the locals will look forward to elect not just an MP but a “true leader” who can bring back the lost glory of India’s erstwhile hub of industrial revolution, often referred to as ‘Manchester of East’. As News18 travelled to Kanpur to feel the pulse of voters, most pointed out that development, inflation and unemployment were major issues, even as others hailed the construction of Ayodhya’s Ram Temple, the improved law-and-order situation in Uttar Pradesh and the PM Modi-CM Yogi factor. “Sabne Kanpur ko apne haal pe chhod diya (Kanpur is surviving on its own). Sarkarein aayi aur gayi, par Kanpur ko bachane ka kaam kissi ne nahi kiya. Kanpur aaj bhi isi factory ki tarah akela, badhaal hai (Governments came and went but none changed the grim picture),” said Badri Prasad, a local who sells tea near Kanpur’s iconic Lal Imli, one of the oldest Colonial-era woollen mills. Prasad said during the British era, his father and grandfather worked in the mill which was the epicentre of the first war of Independence. However, failing to cope up with the fast-moving world and lack of political interest, the mill finally met its end, leaving in the lurch over 5,000 labourers. Prasad said apart from Lal Imli, more than a dozen mills, including Elgin, Jute, and Muir, shut down in the past 50 years, hitting the livelihood of workers. Now, the local says mills are history but the poor development of the city remains a key poll issue. “In present times, industrial development may not be a poll issue but the poor development of the erstwhile Manchester of East is indeed an issue. Barring metro and other cosmetic changes made under the Smart City programme, Kanpur has not witnessed any major infrastructural development in the past two decades. This is the only reason why people of Kanpur don’t want an MP but a leader who can boost the infrastructural development and bring back our lost glory,” he added. Just a kilometre away from Lal Imli stands PPN College, one of the most well-known educational institutions of Kanpur. For students here, the issue of unemployment is supreme and they say their vote will go to the party that creates job opportunities for the youth. “I think the only issue that matters for youth is employment,” said Sudhanshu Shukla, a student. Another student said Kanpur is the second-largest district of UP but when it comes to development, it is nowhere close to capital Lucknow, which is just 100 kilometres away. “Traffic jams are a major issue. We have to leave our home early in order to reach our college on time. But no efforts have been made so far to streamline the city’s traffic,” another student said. People also pointed to inflation as a major issue. Madhu Garg, a housewife, cited the prices of vegetables, mustard oil and other edibles to explain that purchasing edible commodities was burning a hole in the pockets of the aam aadmi. “Be it cosmetics, commodities of daily need, household goods or even vegetables, the prices are touching the sky. The government should put a break on inflation,” she said. While inflation was a key issue among locals, most were all praise for UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s zero-tolerance approach towards crime and criminals. Sudha Mishra, a homemaker from the Civil Lines area, said: “I think UP’s law-and-order situation has been streamlined. Now we can move out fearlessly even late at night. The Yogi government did a wonderful job.” Traders too hailed safety in the state. “We are safe under this government. The crimes against traders are fewer as compared to the previous governments,” said Mohanlal Chandani, a trader who hails from Aryanagar locality of Kanpur. The construction of the Ram Temple too touched a chord with voters who hailed the BJP government for the historic move and said “no previous government had enough courage” to take the step. The Kanpur parliamentary constituency, comprising Govind Nagar, Sisamau, Arya Nagar, Kidwai Nagar, and Kanpur Cantt assembly seats, holds significant political importance in Uttar Pradesh. With a population of 2,226,317 as per the 2011 census, the constituency has 11.72 per cent Scheduled Castes and 0.12 per cent Scheduled Tribe populations, alongside influential Brahmin, Vaishya, Muslim, and Punjabi voters. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Satyadev Pachauri of the BJP secured a resounding victory with 468,937 votes, surpassing Sriprakash Jaiswal of the INC by a substantial margin of 155,934 votes. In the 2014 elections, Dr Murli Manohar Joshi of BJP emerged victorious with 474,712 votes, defeating Jaiswal, who received 251,766 votes. The total registered voter count in Kanpur was 835,125 in 2014. These electoral outcomes underscore the BJP’s stronghold in the Kanpur Lok Sabha constituency. In the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the challenge before Congress would be to stop BJP from scoring a hat-trick in Kanpur. Dr Ramesh Verma, a political analyst who hails from Kanpur, said the road to Delhi passes via the district. “The past electoral outcomes reflect the BJP’s strong presence and consistent performance in the Kanpur constituency in recent years. Factors such as the candidate’s popularity, party strategies, and local dynamics likely influenced voter preferences and contributed to the BJP’s electoral success in the region,” he said. Verma added that in Kanpur, the fight is between Congress and BJP. However, he said it is too early to judge the undercurrents as the Modi-Yogi factor and Congress’s job assurance and ‘Karza Mafi’ are leaving a deep impact on voters. In the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, BJP has fielded Ramesh Awasthi from Kanpur Lok Sabha constituency, while the Grand Old Party has expressed confidence in Alok Mishra. It will be intriguing to see how the voters respond to these candidates in the highly anticipated electoral battle scheduled for May 13.

The teen, whose rash driving allegedly killed two deaths last October, was taken into custody and sent to a juvenile home on Wednesday, a day after the accident in Kanpur’s Barra.

He was sent to a juvenile home and proceedings resumed against him in the six-month-old case. His father has been booked for both accidents. Police said the teen was driving a car on Tuesday and hit four people, who sustained injuries. While the injured were administered first-aid treatment, the 15-year-old was slapped with IPC sections 279 and 338 (reckless driving). Kanpur city commissioner Akhil Kumar criticised the teenager’s family for letting him drive again despite being involved in a fatal accident last year. In October 2023, the teenager killed two people, Sagar Nishad and Ashish Ram Charan, after crashing his speeding car into them on the Ganga Barrage. Additional commissioner of police (law & order) Harish Chandra said the teenager was previously charged under Section 304A (causing death of a person by an act of negligence not amounting to culpable homicide) of the Indian Penal Code. But this provision has been replaced with Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), he added. On Sunday, a 17-year-old boy crashed his speeding Porsche into a motorbike causing the death of two 24-year-old techies on the spot. According to police, the teen was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident. The father of the accused was arrested in the case along with the owner and managers of the bar that served alcohol to the underage teen driver.

(Representational Image: X/ Mister J) Samajwadi Party MLA Irfan Solanki, his younger brother and three others were sentenced to seven years of rigorous imprisonment on Friday in connection with setting fire to a woman’s house in a bid to grab her land. The sentencing has opened the doors for Solanki’s disqualification from the Uttar Pradesh Assembly. According to the Representation of the People Act, any public representative imprisoned for two or more years will be disqualified from the Assembly from the date of conviction. Not only this, after completion of the jail term, the person will not be eligible for membership of the House for the next six years. Police had booked Irfan Solanki, his brother Rizwan Solanki and about four dozen others for rioting and arson 19 months ago. The session MP-MLA court presided by judge Satyendra Nath Tripathi convicted the MLA, his brother, as well as Shauqat Ali, Mohammad Sharif and Izrail on Monday while the quantum of sentence was pronounced on Friday. District Government Counsel Dileep Awasthi told PTI that the court also imposed a fine of Rs 30,500 on each of the convicts, failing which they would have to serve jail term for three more months. Irfan Solanki is a four-time MLA, who first got elected in 2007 from Arya Nagar. He also won Sisamau Assembly Constituency in the 2012, 2017 and 2022 elections. His father Mushtaq Solanki was also a two-time MLA from the Arya Nagar Assembly constituency in Kanpur. In October 2022, Samajwadi Party MLA from Rampur Azam Khan was disqualified from the membership of the Legislative Assembly after being sentenced by a court in a hate speech case. In February 2023, his MLA son Abdullah Azam was disqualified from the Assembly after being convicted in a case of obstructing government work and holding a sit-in demonstration. BJP MLA from Muzaffarnagar’s Khatauli Vikram Singh Saini was disqualified from October 2022 after being sentenced to two years in jail in a case related to the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a BJP MLA from Bangarmau in Unnao, was disqualified from the UP Assembly in 2020 after being convicted in a rape case. Sengar had already been expelled by the BJP. In 2009, Samajwadi Party MP from Faizabad Mitrasen Yadav was disqualified as a member of Parliament after a court sentenced him to seven years in prison in a fraud case. BJP MLA from Gosaiganj in Ayodhya district Indra Pratap Tiwari was also disqualified in the last session after he was convicted and sentenced by a court in a fake marksheet case.

The Bihar chief minister, who has of late been making news for goof-ups, made the faux pas at an election rally on the outskirts of Patna. “It is my wish that Narendra Modi becomes a chief minister again (phir se mukhya mantri banein),” said Kumar, causing those sharing the dais, including local BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad, to squirm in their chairs. Kumar’s confidant Sanjay Kumar Jha, a Rajya Sabha MP and JD (U) national general secretary, was seen getting up and pointing out to his boss that the word was ‘pradhan mantri’ or prime minister. “Of course, he is the prime minister,” snapped the septuagenarian, clearly unmindful of his slip of tongue. In his speech, the JD (U) chief also reiterated that he has realigned with BJP for good and recalled two short-lived alliances with RJD, saying both lasted for “about a month or a month-and-a-half (ek dedh mahine ke liye)”. A section of the crowds stood sniggering, recalling similar goof ups from the leader in the recent past when he ended up hoping for “more than four thousand (char hazar se zyada) seats for the NDA”. Several media outfits shared the video clip of Kumar’s latest goof-up, some recalling the once famous rivalry between the Bihar CM and his the then Gujarat counterpart, and, wondering whether it was a Freudian slip.

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk News18.com Last Updated: May 30, 2024, 18:22 IST Patna, India Former Bihar Deputy CM and RJD MLA Tejashwi Yadav. (Image: PTI) RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on Thursday claimed that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and ally BJP are “not getting along well” and hinted at “something major” happening after June 4, which marks the results day of the 2024 Lok Sabha election. “Ever since I predicted that chacha (uncle) will take a big decision after Lok Sabha polls, he has not been going out to campaign”, noted Yadav, referring to a prediction he had made earlier. Yadav, who lost the Deputy CM’s post following Kumar’s sudden return to the NDA in January this year, made these remarks during a media interaction. “I have also learnt that it is the Governor who is holding meetings with officials and issuing instructions. On the election front, the BJP and the JD(U) are concentrating on their respective states, with no synergy”, the RJD leader alleged. Interestingly, since Kumar exited the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ led by the RJD, Yadav has refrained from directly criticising the JD(U) president. During the elections, Yadav has consistently sought to fish on the NDA’s internal discord. After Kumar’s health issues prevented him from visiting Varanasi where PM Modi was filing his nomination papers, Yadav claimed that the JD(U) leader wished for BJP’s defeat, asserting “his blessings are with me” despite the alliance ending. The young RJD leader, campaigning in a wheelchair due to an injured spine, proudly declared, “By the time campaign for the final phase comes to a close, I would have addressed 251 election meetings.” “INDIA bloc is heading for a spectacular victory. The alliance may win 300 plus seats. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be defeated by his three beloveds (teen Mehbooba) – poverty, price rise and unemployment,” he stated.

    "article_content": "Reported By : Oliver Fredrick News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 19:18 IST Lucknow, India According to the police, the man was attacked after he was seen coming out of the home of a cloth trader and running towards the main gate on the night of June 18. (Representational image: PTI) A 35-year-old- man was allegedly lynched in Uttar Pradesh’s Aligarh district this week over the suspicion of theft. 22 injuries on different parts of the body, a fractured skull, three broken ribs, and a ruptured lung led to his death. On the complaint of the man’s brother, the police have lodged an FIR over the alleged lynching and have arrested six people so far. The deceased has been identified as Mohammed Farid alias Aurangzeb. Despite being a communally sensitive locality with a mixed population, Aligarh’s Mamu-Bhanja area, which falls under Gandhi Park police station, was drenched in post-Eid festivities until late on Tuesday evening. Then rumours of a theft at the house of cloth merchant Mukesh Chand Mittal spread like wildfire. The family members and locals allegedly held 35-year-old Aurangzeb over suspicions and beat him mercilessly. “Over the suspicion of theft, people thrashed my brother mercilessly with sticks and iron rods. They dragged him all over. They treated my brother like an animal,” said Mohammed Zaki, younger brother of Aurangzeb. It was only after the intervention of the police that the man could be freed and he was sent to hospital where he died. Zaki accused the family members of the cloth merchant and the locals of lynching. He said that the incident was a reminder of the 2015 Dadri lynching case in UP when a mob of villagers attacked the home of 52-year-old Mohammed Akhlaq, killing him, for suspicion of slaughtering a cow. “An FIR under IPC section 302 (murder) was registered at the Gandhi Park police station late on Tuesday night in this connection. So far we have arrested six persons named in the FIR and are trying to identify others involved in the incident through available video footage,” said Mrigank Shekhar Pathak, superintendent of police, Aligarh city. According to the police, the man was attacked after he was seen coming out of the home of the cloth trader and running towards the main gate on the night of June 18. As Mittal’s son Rohit, who had stepped out to see off a visiting friend, confronted the stranger and raised an alarm, Aurangzeb fell off the stairs and was soon overpowered by members of the family and others who assembled there, the police said. Some videos, possibly Aurangzeb’s last, where people can be seen questioning him and assaulting him, also went viral on social media on Wednesday. “We are scanning the social media videos. Identification is being done to identify the culprits involved in the act of lynching,” said the Aligarh SP. A panel of two doctors conducted Aurangzeb’s post-mortem. According to the report, there were a total of 22 injuries on different parts of his body including his head, chest, and other body areas. Of all, the most serious injuries, possibly incurred while being beaten with sticks and rods, were on his chest area. It was found that there was a fracture in the skull and three of his ribs were broken, which further ruptured the lungs, possibly leading to internal bleeding that could have led to Aurangzeb’s death. Aurangzeb was the second eldest brother among eight siblings (five sisters and three brothers), said younger brother Zaki. He said his eldest brother Gulzar is married and is settled in Faridabad along with his family, while two sisters are dead, and three are married. “Aurangzeb Bhai used to take care of me and my mother who is paralysed. My father died almost two decades back,” Zaki said. Zafar Akhtar, former area corporator also said that Aurangzeb was lynched. “The UP government is known for taking stern action against criminals. We expect unbiased action in the matter,” Akhtar said. However, the viral videos, which were said to be from hours before Aurangzeb’s death, further sparked communal tensions in the area, after which people from both communities came out on the roads. While one group demanded justice in the matter, the people of the other group strongly opposed the police action. Some people also allegedly pelted the police with stones when officials reached the spot in a bid to ease the situation. “Over the suspicion of theft, a 35-year-old man was assaulted by the public and later died. It further sparked communal tension in the area after which the ‘sector scheme’ was implemented. The entire city was divided into 11 sectors. We have deployed three companies of the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), one company of the Rapid Action Force (RAF), and personnel from three police stations in the area,” said Sanjeev Suman, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Aligarh. The incident also turned political when people from the Samajwadi Party (SP) staged a demonstration, demanding action on the matter. “An innocent man has been lynched by members of a different community and others who painted him as a thief, while the fact is that he had mistakenly entered the house. The incident highlights the plight of the minority communities in the state. We have called for a sit-in and will intensify our protest if all those named in the FIR are not arrested soon,” said Ajju Ishaq, an SP leader. At the same time, dozens of Bajrang Dal volunteers too thronged the area and claimed that the deceased had entered the house to steal."

DSP Kripa Shankar Kannaujiya was caught in a hotel with a female constable three years ago. Kannaujiya has been now posted as a constable in the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) Gorakhpur battalion. On July 6, 2021, the then Circle Officer (CO) in Unnao, Kannaujiya, requested leave from the then Unnao Superintendent of Police (SP) for family reasons. Instead of going home, he reportedly checked into a hotel near Kanpur with a female constable and switched off his private and official phones. When his wife found his number unreachable, she called for help from Unnao SP, who discovered the CO’s mobile network was last active in a hotel in Kanpur. A police team reached the hotel and found the duo. It was reported that Unnao police took video evidence related to the CO. Later, then Inspector General of Police (IGP), Lucknow Range, recommended stern action against him. (With IANS Inputs)"

Delivering judgment in the case of Suwalal Son Of Gopi By Caste Raigar vs State , the bench of Justice Anup Kumar Dhand stated that taking off a girl’s underwear and becoming completely naked oneself, does not fall under Section 376 and Section 511 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and will not attract the offence of ‘attempt to commit rape’. Emphasising what constitutes an “attempt”, the single-judge bench said the accused must have gone beyond the stage of preparation. The court ruled that the act would attract the offence of ‘outraging the modesty of a woman’ punishable under Section 354 of the IPC. “In my opinion, from these facts, no case for an offence under Section 376/511 I.P.C. can be held to be proved. In other words, the accused appellant cannot be held to be guilty of attempt to commit rape. The prosecution has been able to prove the case of assault or use of illegal force on the prosecutrix with an intention to outrage her modesty or with knowledge that her modesty was likely to be outraged. Thus, it is a clear case of Section 354 I.P.C. as the act of the present accused has not proceeded beyond the stage of preparation,” the judge said. The court was hearing the case where the complainant approached the police in Todaraisingh, in Tonk district saying that on March 9, 1991, his grand-daughter, aged about 6 years, was drinking water at the Pyau (Water Booth), where the accused Suvalal came around 8:00 pm and forcefully took her into nearby Dharamshala with an intention to commit rape on her. When the girl raised a hue and cry, the villagers arrived and rescued her, otherwise, the accused might have committed rape on her, the complainant said. Accused Suvalal was just 25 years old when he committed the crime. While delivering the verdict, Justice Dhand referred to cases like Damodar Behera vs Odisha and Sittu vs Rajasthan State , where the accused forcibly stripped a girl naked and, despite her resistance, tried to have physical relations with her. In these cases, the act was considered attempted rape. As per the court, three stages need to be fulfilled for any act to be punishable under the offence of “attempted rape”. “The first stage exists when the culprit first entertains the idea or intention to commit an offence. In the second stage, he makes preparations to commit it. The third stage is reached when the culprit takes deliberate overt steps to commit the offence,” it said. For an offence of an attempt to commit rape, the prosecution must establish that it has gone beyond the stage of preparation, it added. As per the case details, the 6-year-old prosecutrix alleged that the accused undressed them both and fled the scene when she called for help. However, there was no allegation that the accused attempted penetration. The District Court Of Tonk convicted Suvalal of attempting rape. He remained in jail for two and a half months during the trial. The court modified Sections 376/511 under which the trial court had convicted him and changed it to Section 354."

(File Photo) In hard-hitting remarks on the outcome of the Lok sabha polls, RSS leader Indresh Kumar on Thursday slammed the ruling BJP for “arrogance” and the opposition INDIA bloc for being “anti-Ram”. Speaking at the ‘Ramrath Ayodhya Yatra Darshan Poojan Samaroh’ at Kanota near Jaipur, the RSS national executive member did not mention the rivals by name but suggested that the poll outcome reflected their attitudes. “The party which did the bhakti (of lord Ram) but became arrogant was stopped at 241 but it was made the biggest party,” he said, in an apparent reference to Narendra Modi-led BJP which got 240 seats in the Lok Sabha seats. “And those who had no faith in Ram, they together were stopped at 234,” he said, apparently referring to the INDIA bloc. “See the ‘Vidhan’ of Ram Rajya in democracy; those who did ‘Bhakti (worshipped) of Ram but gradually turned arrogant, that party emerged as the biggest party, but the vote and power that should have been given was stopped by God due to their arrogance,” he said. “Those who opposed Ram, none of them was given power. Even all of them together were made number two. God’s justice is true and enjoyable,” he said. “Those who worship Ram should be humble and those who oppose Ram, the Lord himself dealt with them,” he said. He said Lord Ram does not discriminate and does not punish. “Ram does not make anyone lament. Ram gives justice to everyone. He gives and will keep on giving. Lord Ram was always just and will remain so,” he said. Kumar also said Lord Ram protected people and did good to Ravana too. The remark came days after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said that a true ‘sevak’ does not have arrogance and serves the people by maintaining ‘dignity’."

However, there is no official confirmation from the Congress leadership on whether his resignation has been accepted. Speculations have already surfaced over who would succeed him. Confirming his resignation, Mr Chowdhury said, “Since Mallikarjun Kharge became the Congress’s national president, there was no state president. Now when the full-time President is appointed you will all come to know that.” Incidentally, he made this announcement just a day after the Congress’s Rajya Sabha member and former Union Finance Minister, P Chidambaram, dropped in at the state secretariat Nabanna and had a 35-minute meeting with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Adhir Chowdhury, a five-time party Lok Sabha MP from Murshidabad’s Baharampur constituency, was defeated by the Trinamool Congress’s celebrity candidate and former Indian cricketer Yusuf Pathan. News about Mr Chowdhury’s differences with the party’s high command has been doing the rounds for quite some time over the issue of the party’s relationship with the Trinamool. Adhir Chowdhury has always been vocal about his views on having an electoral understanding with the CPI(M)-led Left Front. His differences with Mallikarjun Kharge also surfaced during the Lok Sabha polls.

(BCCI Photo) The former Indian opening batter, Gautam Gambhir suggested that the International Cricket Council (ICC) revisit the two new-ball rules in the white-ball format as he suggested that the mandate is ‘unfair’ to the finger spinners. Speaking at the ‘Rise to Leadership’ talk show by the Indian Chamber of Commerce, Gambhir revealed his thoughts regarding the rule. “One thing I would change is the use of two new balls, especially in white-ball cricket,” Gambhir said. Several experts were not in favour of this rule as they felt that it put the finger spinners at a disadvantage along with the quicker bowlers due to the ball retaining its shine, thus reducing the chances of reverse swing. “It is very unfair for finger spinners, who are not playing enough white-ball cricket because there is nothing for them. It is not right. “The ICC’s job is to ensure that everyone, whether a finger spinner, fast bowler, wrist spinner, or batter, has an equal opportunity to showcase their talents,” said Gambhir, who is also the mentor of the Kolkata Knight Riders.

A reputed batter during his time, Gambhir requested that the ICC review this rule and suggested that the apex international cricket board being the reason for finger spinners being out of fashion. “Taking that opportunity away from certain players is very unfair. Today, you hardly see any finger spinners playing white-ball cricket. Why? The blame lies not with them, but with the ICC”. “There is no reverse swing anymore because of the two new balls, and there is nothing for finger spinners or left-arm spinners.

Of 121 municipalities in the state, the BJP was ahead on 69 and it had the upper hand in 44 municipal wards of the 144 in Kolkata. Taking note of this, TMC chairperson and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has called a review meeting with leaders of all municipalities on June 24. Civic elections are to be held in the state next year and the recent poll outcome in urban areas is a matter of concern for Trinamool. Though Mamata Banerjee’s Lakshmir Bhandar scheme, providing stipends to women, proved popular in rural areas, it was overshadowed by negative factors for the TMC in urban parts. Party insiders say that Mamata Banerjee and national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee picked up on this as soon as the results were out and the TMC chairperson has already started reviewing it. Sources said that Mamata on Thursday met Kolkata mayor and state municipal affairs minister Firhad Hakim and raised various issues regarding urban areas. The CM also gave strict instructions to implement certain measures, they added. The TMC chief will meet heads of all municipalities on Monday and “fireworks are expected there”, said a party leader. According to experts and party insiders, councillors’ and local-level leaders’ high-handedness and faction fighting should be reduced. Some councillors have a bad image and there are complaints that they are not available in times of need, they said, adding that some allegedly also take bribes for various works. Campaigning on the state government’s welfare schemes has also not been done properly in various municipalities, said TMC sources. People in urban areas are generally not likely to take advantage of such schemes, they said. Some party leaders also say that people who have not performed well should not be given election tickets next time."

The early dismissals of Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar in the chase of 275 had silenced the crowd at the Wankhede Stadium before Gambhir decided to do the heavy lifting. He found some support from young Virat Kohli before skipper MS Dhoni joined him in what turned out to be a historic partnership. The duo stitched a 109-run stand with Gambhir on the verge of a memorable century. But he was cleaned up by Tillakaratne Dishan in the 42nd over of the chase with India requiring 51 runs more. IND vs BAN Live Score, T20 World Cup Super 8 Although Dhoni, who got the company of Yuvraj Singh, finished the task with an iconic six, Gambhir still regrets not remaining till the end and winning the World Cup for India on home soil. “I wish I had finished that game,” Gambhir said, referring to the 2011 World Cup final. “It was my job to finish the game, rather than leaving it for someone to finish the game. If I had to turn back the clock, I would go back there and score the last run, irrespective of how many runs I scored,” he added. Gambhir in line to succeed Rahul Dravid as India coach Front-runner for the role of head coach of the Indian cricket team, Gautam Gambhir did not give too many hints regarding a potential change in role but he opened up regarding the philosophies he abides by as a coach. Speaking at the Indian Chamber of Commerce event in Kolkata, the former Indian opener revealed that his mantra was based on a team-first philosophy. This led him to mentor the Kolkata Knight Riders to the title of the 2024 edition of the Indian Premier League. When asked regarding the India head coaching job, Gambhir did not give much away. “I don’t see that far ahead. You are grilling me, asking me all tough questions,” he said. “It is difficult to answer right now. All I can say is that I’m happy being here, just finished a brilliant journey (and) let’s enjoy that. I’m in a very happy space right now,” Gambhir said at a ‘Rise To Leadership’ seminar here.

Kataria was arrested following a joint raid at his residence in Gurugram’s Sector-109. During the raids, several suspicious documents and a huge stash of cash were reportedly recovered. A case has been registered against Kataria under section 370 (offence of trafficking) of the IPC at the Bajghera Police Station in Gurugram, police said. The police action came after two youths from Uttar Pradesh filed complaints that Karatia trafficked them to Laos and forced them into cyber fraud operations. The complainants, Arun Kumar, a resident of Fatehpur and Manish Tomar, a resident of Hapur, said that they were unemployed and came in touch with Kataria via Instagram. According to the complainants, they saw an advertisement about the abroad-based job on Bobby’s YouTube channel MBK, following which they approached the YouTuber via WhatsApp. Bobby called them to meet his office in Sector 109 on the pretext of getting them a job in a foreign country. The complainant then met Kataria in his office on 1 February 2024 and paid Rs 2,000 for registration. After this, on the request of Bobby Kataria, on February 13, Rs 50,000 was transferred to his official account which was registered in the name of MBK Global Visa Private Limited. Thereafter, on Bobby’s instruction on March 14, another amount of Rs 1 lakh was transferred to the account of a person named Ankit Shaukeen. Kataria sent the tickets to Vientiane (Laos) through Shaukeen’s WhatsApp. On March 28, as per the instructions of Bobby Kataria, Kumar got Rs 50,000 converted into USD at the airport and boarded the flight to Vientiane. Similarly, lakhs of rupees were taken from his friend Manish Tomar on the pretext of sending him to Singapore, but he was also made to board a flight to Vientiane. When both of them landed at Vientiane airport, they met a young man named Abhi, who described himself as a friend of Bobby Kataria and a Pakistani agent. He dropped them off at the Hotel Mican Son in Vientiane, where they found a young man named Ankit Shaukeen and Nitish Sharma alias Rocky. They took the victims to an anonymous Chinese company. There both the friends were severely beaten and their passports were snatched. At the same time, they were forced to commit cyber fraud against US citizens. Both of them were threatened that if the work was not done as per their instructions then they would not be able to return to India and they would be killed there. “About 150 Indians including women were brought into that company through human trafficking by brokers like Bobby Kataria on the pretext of jobs. Somehow, we escaped from there and reached the Indian Embassy and came back to India and filed a police complaint against Kataria,” the complainant told the police. Karatia is not new to controversies. In 2022, an FIR was registered against him for allegedly posting obscene remarks about a woman on social media and threatening her.

Another security personnel tries to rescue his colleague and hits a resident with a stick. The group snatches the stick from him and thrashes him instead. As the clash intensified, one QRT personnel ran away to escape the chaotic scene amid danger to life while the other one got out of the society in his vehicle.

Amul on Monday requested a woman customer in Noida to return the ice cream tub, in which she claimed to have found a centipede, for further investigation and asserted that it offers superior quality dairy products in both India and global markets. A woman in Noida has claimed she has found a centipede inside an ice cream tub she ordered through an instant delivery app, said food safety officials, who have launched a probe into the matter. In a post on X on June 15, the woman, who identified herself as Deepa Devi, shared a picture showing the insect inside the ice cream tub. Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), which markets dairy products under the Amul brand, regretted the inconvenience caused to the woman customers in Noida. Noida’s food safety department has launched a probe into this matter. In a statement, Amul said it immediately responded to the complaint on social media. “We deeply regret the inconvenience caused to her because of this incident,” the statement said. Amul said its team was trying to contact the customer continuously and was allowed to meet after 9:30 pm on the same day (June 15). “During our meeting with the customer, we had requested the customer to provide the said ice cream tub for investigation, unfortunately, the customer refused to hand over the same. “Unless the complaint pack is retrieved from the customer it would be difficult for us to investigate the matter and hence comment specifically on the issue which involves pack and supply chain integrity as well,” Amul said. During the interaction, the customer was informed and assured about Amul’s state-of-the-art ISO-certified plants which are automated and pass through numerous stringent quality checks before offering any product for sale to the esteemed customers. Amul also invited the customer to visit its plant to assure her about the quality processes being followed. Amul assured customers about the superior quality of Amul Ice Cream. Amul highlighted that it is among India’s most trusted brands, owned by 36 lakh farmers. It markets 22 billion packs of Amul products annually across 50+ countries with the highest quality and food safety standards from 100+ dairies across India. “We would like to assure you that we take the utmost care to ensure our products are safe, healthy and nutritious to serve our customers daily,” Amul said. The cooperative organisation requested the customer to return the ice cream tub for a thorough investigation. “Once we receive the complaint pack from the customer, we shall investigate the matter from all angles and again get back to our customers with the findings,” Amul said."

(File photo) Over 10 people died in the last three days and at least 12 are on life support due to extreme heatwave in the Delhi-NCR region. Union Health Minister JP Nadda on Wednesday sent an advisory to all the hospitals to give priority treatment for all who have been admitted due to the heat wave. The Union minister reviewed the heatwave situation and preparedness of the central government hospitals and directed the officials to ensure that all hospitals are prepared to provide the best healthcare to the affected. He also directed for special heatwave units to be started in the central government hospitals, the Union Health Ministry said in a statement. According to an NDTV report, five people died over the last two days and at least 12 were put on life support at Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. Dr Ajay Shukla, medical superintendent of the state-run hospital, informed that 22 people had been admitted after they suffered a heatstroke. “Five patients died and 12 or 13 patients are on ventilator support,”Dr Shukla was quoted by NDTV as saying. The doctor further warned that the mortality rate in heatstroke cases is quite high, about 60-70%. “If the patient is brought late to the hospital, one organ after the other starts failing. There is a lack of awareness. A lot of these patients are migrant labourers. Also, the symptoms (of heatstroke) can be easily missed or mistaken for something else. It’s only when patients faint that their relatives feel that hospitalisation is needed,” he said. Dr Shukla also emphasised the need to spread awareness about heatstroke. “We need to educate people. Instead of rushing to the hospital, if you suspect that a person is suffering from heatstroke, you must start cooling there and then. Use water, ice, while trying to get them to the hospital. We have also equipped ambulances so that they can start cooling immediately after they reach the patients,” he said. On the other hand, seven people were found dead in different parts of Noida in the last 24 hours without any visible signs of injury amid a heat wave, a PTI report said. Police on Tuesday noted that the cause of death is yet to be ascertained. On chances of heat waves causing these deaths, a police spokesperson said they are “actively investigating” these cases and have initiated necessary legal proceedings."

(PTI file photo) The Gautam Buddh Nagar health department received 18 more bodies for postmortem on June 21 amid heatwave conditions, taking the number of autopsies carried out in four days to 93, officials said on Saturday. The department has also started DNA sampling of unidentified bodies, they said. “On June 21, we received 18 more bodies for postmortem. Out of these, six bodies are unidentified,” Chief Medical Officer Dr Suneel Kumar Sharma said. “Now, we have started one more thing. We are taking DNA samples of unidentified bodies and will hand them over to police whenever required,” Sharma said. With this, these bodies can be disposed timely and the pile up at the mortuary can be reduced, he added. From June 18 to 20, the department received at least 75 bodies for autopsy but could not directly linked those to heatwave, Sharma told reporters on Friday. Earlier, he said the number of bodies usually received at mortuary for postmortem in the district was around seven or eight daily, but this number has swelled up over 20 of late. He also described the rise in daily numbers as “unexpected”. On the heatwave impact, the CMO said there is no doubt the weather is extreme and it’s “not usual heat”. “This heat is something else, the content of humidity in the weather has also risen of late. This is painful heat and chances of death increase in it.” “The impact of heat is not equal on everybody. Those who are completely healthy can bear it. If you live in rural areas and spend time under trees, maybe then also you can bear the heat,” he said. “But here in cases of construction workers, security personnel, even traffic police and volunteers, they need to use a cap on their head, consume ORS and not stay in the open for long. Such measures can help save lives,” the doctor added. Sharma said private hospitals like Kailash, Felix, Fortis have extended their support to government hospital by allowing their mortuary freezers for keeping the bodies."

(File Photo) Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Friday acknowledged that discontent among onion growers over issues related to the kitchen staple, including low prices, contributed in dismal performance of the ruling Mahayuti’s in the recent Lok Sabha elections. He said the Shiv Sena-BJP-NCP alliance had to “pay the price” for discontent among farmers in the onion growing belt of the state, including Nashik, where the ruling coalition fared poorly in the polls. Pawar’s statement came three days after Chief Minister Eknath Shinde admitted farm distress cost the Mahayuti alliance dearly and added, “Onions made us cry in Nashik, soybean and cotton in Marathwada and Vidarbha (in polls).” Talking to reporters in Pune, Pawar said they were constantly speaking about the need for support price for onion, and said the interest of both farmers and consumers should be protected. He maintained the Mahayuti faced a beating in all Lok Sabha seats in the onion growing belt barring Jalgaon and Raver. A ban on onion export by the Centre in December last year to control retail prices led to protests by farmers, especially in the Nashik belt. The ban was eventually lifted in early May. The Shiv Sena and its ally BJP lost Nashik and Dindori Lok Sabha seats, respectively. The alliance could only win one seat in Marathwada and just two in Vidarbha."

Assembly polls in Maharashtra are due in October. (PTI Photo) Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Friday asserted his focus was on development and the upcoming assembly polls as he sought to sidestep questions related to an article in an RSS-linked publication that was critical of the BJP’s alliance with the NCP. Asked about the article published in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-affiliated magazine ‘Organiser’ after the Lok Sabha poll results, the NCP president, who joined the Shiv Sena-BJP government one year ago, said he does not want to speak on the issue. “A lot of leaders are expressing their views and opinions after the polls. In a democracy, it is their right to express their opinions and I do not want to react to them. I have focussed myself on development, how we can provide additional help and complete more development works. My attempt will be on how we, as Mahayuti, can face the state assembly polls with new energy,” he told reporters in Pune when asked about the article. The ruling Mahayuti consists of the Shiv Sena, the BJP and the Ajit Pawar-led NCP. Assembly polls in Maharashtra are due in October. The article in the magazine, penned by an RSS ideologue, analysed the Lok Sabha poll results and called them a ‘reality check’ for ”overconfident” BJP workers. It also had a reference to Maharashtra, where the BJP fared poorly as its seat tally came to down to nine from 23 in 2019. “Maharashtra is a prime example of unnecessary politicking and avoidable manipulations. NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar joined BJP though BJP and split SS (Shiv Sena) had a comfortable majority. Sharad Pawar would have faded away in two-three years as NCP would have lost energy with infighting between cousins,” it said. “Why was this ill-advised step taken? BJP supporters were hurt because they had fought against this Congress ideology for years and were persecuted. In a single stroke, BJP reduced its brand value. After years of struggle to become numero uno in Maharashtra, it became just another political party without any difference,” the article noted."

(Image: PTI) A Pune court on Friday sent realtor Vishal S. Agarwal and his wife Shivani V. Agarwal to 14 days’ judicial remand in the case about the destruction of evidence of the Porsche accident on May 19. The Agarwals are the parents of a 17-year-old boy accused of the drunken hit-and-run accident with his Porsche that killed two techies – Ashwini Koshtha and Anish Awadhiya, both aged 24 and hailing from Madhya Pradesh – at Kalyani Nagar junction that morning. The couple were produced before the court after their police custody ended, along with another co-accused Ashpak Makandar, who was the middleman for the alleged blood swap deal. The prosecutor sought judicial remand for the Agarwals which was granted and another three days’ police custody for Makandar, but the court rejected this and he too was sent to 14 days judicial remand. The Agarwals and Makandar had allegedly changed the blood samples of the minor boy to prove that he was not under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident, which had triggered a nationwide furore. Makandar had allegedly acted as a conduit in the deal between the Agarwals and doctors of the government-run Sassoon General Hospital where the blood samples were collected on May 19. The police have alleged that the boy’s blood sample was allegedly swapped with his mother (Shivani Agarwal) ostensibly to derail the investigation. The prosecution argued that Makandar had met the Agarwals in this connection and they wanted to probe this aspect deeper plus find out the money trail of Rs 5 lakh in which Rs 4 lakh have been recovered. However, the defence lawyers said that no fresh grounds had been established by the police nor much progress had been made in the investigations and opposed the plea for further remand. The minor boy is presently under detention at a juvenile correctional facility till June 25, after the Juvenile Justice Board declined to release him on June 12."

Months after the Pune police recovered mephedrone worth over Rs 3,600 crore, considered one of the biggest drug busts in the country, the investigation into the case was transferred to the Narcotics Control Bureau on Saturday, an official said. “It is a part of the process. We received consent from the central and state governments. After necessary permission from the court, Pune police have handed over the investigation to the NCB,” said a senior crime branch official. NCB is the apex coordinating body concerning drugs that also functions as an enforcement agency through its zones and sub-zones. NCB officials work closely with the Customs, state police and other law enforcement units. According to the Pune police, they seized February 1,836 kg of mephedrone, commonly known as ‘Meow Meow’, worth Rs 3,672 crore from Maharashtra, Delhi and other parts of the country and uncovered an international narcotics trade link. The drug was produced in various cities. Those involved in the racket had roped in a Delhi-based courier company and shipped some consignments of the drug to London, concealed in ready-to-eat food packets, police had said earlier, police had said earlier. A large quantity of the contraband had been stored in a godown-like structure in Kupwad town of Sangli district in Western Maharashtra. Mephedrone is a synthetic stimulant often associated with the “rave party culture” for its euphoric effects and is mostly abused by youngsters. Nine persons have been arrested over the drug bust so far. It has been alleged that the mastermind of the mephedrone syndicate is one Sundip Dhunay, a British national of Indian origin. A red corner notice through Interpol has been issued against him, said officials."

(Image: PTI/File) A committee formed to probe the conduct of two JJB members in connection with the bail given to the minor accused in the Pune Porsche crash case has found “procedural lapses”, “misconduct” and “non compliance of norms”, a top source from WCD said on Saturday. On May 19, two IT professionals were killed in Kalyani Nagar here after their motorcycle was hit by a speeding Porsche car allegedly driven by a minor in an inebriated condition. The case caused a national uproar after the Juvenile Justice Board member L N Danwade gave bail to the accused on very lenient terms, including writing a 300-word essay on road safety. “The five-member committee submitted its 125-page report on Friday to the Women and Child Development department commissioner. The WCD department, after receipt of the report, has issued show cause notices to two JJB members who were appointed by the department,” a source from WCD told PTI on the condition of anonymity. “The report has found glaring lapses and mistakes while issuing the bail order by a single member of the JJB on May 19. Though the order granting bail was issued by one member, the other member gave consent the next day instead of reviewing the order. Misconduct and non compliance of norms has also been found on the part of the two members and they have been apprised about it,” he said. He said that the committee, in its report, found that there was a haste in issuing the order and violation of certain norms. “The police had mentioned section 304 ( culpable homicide not amounting to murder) but it was overlooked while the order was issued by the board member,” the official said. As part of its probe, the committee appointed by the WCD department had recorded the statement of the two JJB members, he added. The JJB comprises two members appointed by the WCD department and one member from the judiciary. The committee’s mandate was to probe the two members appointed by the state government, the official pointed out. WCD commissioner Dr Prashant Narnavare confirmed that the report had been submitted by the probe committee and said show cause notices had been issued to both JJB members. The two members have been asked to furnish their replies in the next four to five days, he said. Incidentally, Pune police commissioner Amitesh Kumar had earlier said section 304 was invoked in the case on the first day itself and was mentioned along with other relevant sections in the remand report placed before the JJB. Police had also sought that the accused be tried as an adult since he was 17 years and eight months old but the JJB took a different stand and kept its plea (pertaining to the accused) as “seen and filed”."

(PTI File) A sessions court here on Friday reserved its order on the pleas filed by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders Arvind Kejriwal and Sanjay Singh, challenging the summons issued to them by a local magistrate in a criminal defamation case over comments about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s educational qualification. After hearing arguments from all the parties, Judge J M Brahmbhatt reserved the order for September 14. The court started hearing the matter on September 6, days after the Gujarat High Court asked the principal judge of the sessions court to assign a judge and said that it should be decided within ten days. Gujarat University has filed a complaint of `criminal defamation’ before a metropolitan magistrate here against Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal and AAP’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh over their “sarcastic and derogatory” statements in connection with Modi’s degrees. During the hearing on September 6 and 8, the AAP leaders’ lawyers argued that the summoning order of the trial court was wrong and Gujarat University could not file a defamation case in this matter. No case was made out against the two leaders, they argued. The magistrate’s court, while summoning the two leaders, had observed that prima facie a case under section 500 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code was made out. Gujarat University’s registrar Piyush Patel filed the complaint over Kejriwal and Singh’s comments after the Gujarat High Court set aside an order of the Chief Information Commissioner to provide information about Modi’s degrees to them under the Right To Information Act. The AAP leaders made defamatory statements intentionally in press conferences and on Twitter (now X) targeting the university, the complaint alleged. Their comments were defamatory, and sarcastic and hurt the prestige of the university, it claimed."

Patel, who works as a team leader at a software developer firm in Gandhinagar, told police that on June 23 met a woman named Aditi Patel on a matrimonial website, according to a report by Times of India . The woman reportedly claimed she lived in Maninagar and had an import and export business in the UK. During their conversation, the woman advised Patel to invest in a cryptocurrency named Banocoin for good returns. She also gave him the number of the firm’s customer care executive. Following this, the victim said he had a chat with a representative on the number and got himself registered on their website. As per the FIR filed by police, Patel invested Rs 1.34 crore in 18 transactions between July 20 and August 31, as per the TOI report. After the initial investment of Rs 1 lakh on July 20, he received a profit of 78 USDT (US dollar tether), which is a cryptocurrency. He later withdrew 50 USDT from his account without any trouble. This motivated him to keep investing. However, all hell broke loose for Patel when he again tried to withdraw Rs 2.59 lakh from his account on September 3 and was told his account had been frozen. Patel promptly called the customer care number provided by Aditi, where a representative told him to invest an additional Rs 35 lakh in order to de-freeze his account. After this, Patel tried contacting Aditi, but she did not respond. By this time, the man realised he had been scammed by cyber swindlers and approached the police. With the technology bloom, digital currency scams are becoming a common practice these days, where people get robbed of their hard-earned money with just a few clicks. In order to avoid such scams, people are advised to be careful before trusting strangers and perform a thorough background check before making any investment."

Celebs and their love life has always been in the limelight. Many times we hear news about two co-actors dating each other, which at times turns out to be just rumours. For many celebs, film or a show’s sets play the cupid for uniting them with the love of their life. Sounds cute and romantic? Well, hold your horses. There also have been many instances where two actors loved each other but their relationship couldn’t blossom into marriage. Similar was the case with Telugu actor Saikiran and actress Laya, who were rumoured to be in a relationship for a long time. Reports suggested that the two were even planning to get married but unfortunately, it couldn’t happen and the duo parted ways. In 2001, Saikiran and Laya acted in the film Preminchu. The film was a hit and the audience was left in awe of their on-screen pairing. It was rumoured that the duo fell in love during the film’s shooting and were about to get married soon but life had other plans for them. Last year, Saikiran opened up about his marriage plans with Laya. He shared that their families also wanted them to get settled together, but both families also had their beliefs in horoscopes. Their marriage plans were put aside as their horoscopes didn’t match and eventually, the couple had to part ways. Later, Saikiran married a software specialist named Vyshnavi in 2010. He currently lives in Hyderabad. Laya, on the other hand, tied the knot with Dr Sri Ganesh Gotry in 2006 and settled in the US. The couple are doting parents to a son and a daughter. Saikiran first came into the limelight for his performance in the 2000 film Nuvvekavali which gathered him a lot of appreciation. Later he appeared in several other big Telugu films like Rave Na Chelia, Darling Darling, Manasunte Chalu, Aadante Ado Typeu and Pelli Paro. Apart from the regional films, Saikiran has also appeared in several Telugu TV serials like Sudi Gundalu, Koilamma, Abhilasha, Maunaragam, Inti Guttu and others. He currently plays the role of Mahendra in the TV serial Guppedantha Manasu. Laya, on the other hand, is all set to make her Tollywood comeback after a long hiatus of 20 years with south superstar Nithin’s upcoming film Thammudu."

The world-renowned Tirumala is thronged with devotees every single day. The seven hills resound with the remembrance of Lord Vishnu’s name. Lakhs of devotees from different states come to Tirumala’s Sri Venkateswara Swami Temple and the place is crowded with people regularly. In this context, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has recently released good news for the devotees. Regular devotees have been coming to Tirumala in large numbers for the past few months. This has made it difficult for the devotees to see Srivari Seva and take rooms. Hence, TTD is releasing darshan tickets and room quotas for devotees. The quota of Rs 300 special entrance darshan tickets for September was released earlier today at 10 am. Similarly, the room quota for September will be released today at 3 pm.

We have often seen incidents where a parrot is reciting a poem or singing a song. Now, a chicken in Laxmipur village of Karimnagar district, Telangana is garnering headlines due to his obedient nature and extraordinary skills. The chicken is of the Kadaknath breed. A person named Mallareddy from Lakshmipur village has a chicken farm. In the chicken farm, a Kadaknath chicken is following the instructions of its owner. If asked to go back it goes back and if the owner demands him to come forward, it lunges in front. The people are shocked by this act. The video of the chicken reportedly following the instructions of the owner is going viral. The chicken owner, Mallareddy said that he has a chicken farm where 200 Kadaknaths are being reared. One of them holds an affinity for him, he added. It rests on the shoulders and legs of the owners. It follows the instructions of the owners. The chicken understands the words of his master. His chicken farm is often surrounded by people as they are amazed at the bond between the chicken and the owner. The video of the chicken is going viral in which it is moving in a farm-like place. It is reportedly walking on the instructions given to it by its owner. In the video, the chicken is seen moving forward and backwards before uniting with other chickens near the bike stand. Take a look at the video: The owner said that chickens on his farm listen to him. The chickens of this farm are called Babbbba by the owner. They reach home after hearing the cooing from their master’s voice. It is useful for the owner in spotting the hidden chicken or if they are required to assemble it for feeding. The owner originally shared the video with TV9."

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk Local18 Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 13:56 IST Bengaluru, India The police arrested the thieves after they were alerted. In Karnataka’s Kundapura district, there is now a buzz regarding its Sign-In Security, which has left thieves weary. This has offered great relief to homeowners, banks, and jewellery store owners, who can now sleep soundly without fearing theft and knowing that their assets are secured. This new security system has been installed in many shops, establishments and temples in the area. This has made catching thieves red-handed much easier. To the delight of the residents of Kundapura, last week, two theft attempts were thwarted. A thief attempting to break into society was also arrested on the spot because of the new security system. When he tried to break in, the police were alerted by the Sign-In Security system. They arrived at the right time and arrested him. As bizarre as it may sound, last week, two individuals attempted to steal cattle and got caught because of the security system. As the thieves attempted to steal the cattle from Kamalashile temple’s cowshed, they got caught red-handed, all because of the discreet alert by Sign-in Security. The police arrested the thieves after they were alerted. So, what is this sign-in security that has been discreetly alerting the police and preventing thefts? The Sign-In Security is a private organisation based in Hangarkatta Port. It offers 24-hour live monitoring through CCTV. Many jewellery stores, banks, temples, financial institutes, cooperative societies, and commercial and trade shops in the Kundapura area have adopted the system. The Sign-In Security team keeps round-the-clock surveillance over all their clients. Any suspicious activity or potential theft is immediately reported to the police to alert them and help them nab the thieves red-handed. This has made it a lot easier to prevent theft and arrest culprits and in exchange lets the clients sleep peacefully knowing that their property or assets are safe. Now, more and more residents are trusting the Sign-In Security and taking their help to prevent potential thefts."

Farmers of Bokkahalli village, located in Nanjangud taluka of Mysuru district in Karnataka, have a good paddy crop this time. According to reports, the farmers here have carried out agricultural activities depending on the same water from the pre-monsoon rains that fell this time. For more than 50 acres, paddy cultivation has been done without relying on any river source. Now, the paddy has yielded, and the farmers are happy. In Bokkahalli village, the farmers have naturally gotten a good paddy crop due to the torrential rains that fell in May in Rampura Nala. As the paddy crop requires a lot of water, water is obtained from canals. But this time the crop was grown with rainwater. According to the farmers, if it rains well, they don’t need any river-source water for cultivation. This year, they have already preserved the paddy crop. They have grown paddy in an area of more than 50 acres using rainwater. A farmer added that this year they have grown crops at less cost and made more profit. As per the India Meteorological Department, India’s monsoon has delivered a fifth less rain than normal so far this season. Since June 1, India has received 20 per cent less rainfall than normal including all regions except for a few southern states and due to hot waves in certain northern states. Summer rains, critical to economic growth in Asia’s third-largest economy, usually begin in the south around June 1 before spreading nationwide by July 8, allowing farmers to plant crops such as rice, cotton, soybeans and sugarcane. According to the data, the rain shortfall in soybean, cotton, sugarcane, and pulses-growing central India has risen to 29 per cent, while the paddy-growing southern region received 17 per cent more rainfall than normal due to the early onset of the monsoon."

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk News18.com Last Updated: June 22, 2024, 18:53 IST New Delhi, India The National Testing Agency (NTA) is gearing up to conduct a retest on Sunday for the medical entrance exam for 1,563 candidates who were earlier awarded grace marks to make up for the loss of time at six centres. (File image: PTI) The Centre on Saturday announced the formation of a high-level committee of experts to ensure the transparent, smooth, and fair conduct of examinations in the country amid the raging NEET controversy and nationwide protests by students seeking a probe into the exam. Authorities from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have held several key individuals allegedly connected to the “paper leak”. Here is a timeline of the events connected to this controversy that has created ripples across India’s education system: May 5: The National Testing Agency conducted the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) on May 5 for 24 lakh students at 4,750 centres across 571 cities. There were allegations of paper leaks across centres during the exam but these were dismissed by the NTA and union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan. The NTA and the government said that the question papers for Hindi and English medium were mixed at six centres, but this was rectified and students were given extra time to complete the NEET exam. June 4: NTA declared the NEET UG 2024 results on the day of the counting of votes for the Lok Sabha elections 2024. Soon after, students and parents took to the streets to protest the unusual results and the awarding of grace marks to around 1,500 students. The protesters demanded a retest and re-evaluation of all marks after it was found that 67 students had topped the exam. June 13: The matter reached the Supreme Court with multiple petitions seeking cancellation of the exams. In the first hearing, the SC sought the NTA’s response but refused to stay the NEET UG counselling process. The court was informed that the Centre had decided to revoke the grace marks awarded to 1,563 students. The government said that if the affected students wished to appear for a re-exam, it would be held on June 23. The results for those students will be declared before June 30 and the counselling will take place from July 6, it added. June 18: The Supreme Court issued a notice to the NTA, seeking a response to the pleas in connection with the alleged paper leaks and malpractices. “If there is 0.001% negligence on the part of anyone, it should be thoroughly dealt with. Children have prepared for the exams. We cannot forget their labour,” the top court said. June 19: The union education ministry cancelled the University Grants Commission–National Eligibility Test (NET) after concerns were raised about the exam’s integrity. The UGC-NET 2024 was conducted on June 18 across 317 cities. The government also ordered a CBI probe into the UGC-NET exam. June 20: The Centre said it was forming a high-level committee to provide recommendations for enhancing the structure, processes, data management, and security protocols of the NTA. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a First Information Report (FIR) into the UGC-NET paper leak case against unidentified persons on a reference from the union education ministry, officials said. Anurag Yadav, a 22-year-old NEET UG 2024 aspirant, was arrested by Bihar police after confessing that the leaked question paper he received matched the actual exam question paper. The arrest came as part of a larger investigation, which also saw four men from Bihar detained for allegedly accessing the exam paper a day before the test. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi amid the controversy, saying that the PM was more concerned about the Speaker’s election. A group of NEET aspirants along with their parents on Thursday met Rahul at his residence, to seek his support in demanding re-examination of the MBBS qualifying paper. Also, Bihar’s deputy chief minister Vijay Kumar Sinha claimed the arrested prime accused in the NEET “paper leak” is linked to officials associated with RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav. June 21: The Centre on Friday notified a stringent law, which was passed in February, to prevent paper leaks and cheating. Under the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024, any person or persons found guilty of leaking a paper or tampering with answer sheets will receive a minimum jail term of three years. This can be extended to five years with a fine of up to Rs 10 lakh. All offences under the Act will be cognisable and non-bailable. The Supreme Court once again declined to stay the process of NEET-UG 2024 counselling. The apex court has issued a notice to the National Testing Agency (NTA). The top court tagged the fresh pleas along with pending petitions and posted them for hearing on July 8. Delhi Congress workers on Friday held a demonstration near the BJP headquarters over the alleged irregularities in NEET 2024. The demonstration was led by Delhi Congress president Devender Yadav. June 22: The ministry of education on Saturday announced a high-level committee of experts to ensure transparent smooth and fair conduct of examinations amid the NEET and UGC-NET row. The panel of experts will make recommendations on reforms in the mechanism of the examination process, improvement in data security protocols, and structure and functioning of the National Testing Agency. The panel will be headed by Dr K Radhakrishnan, former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chairperson and the chairman of the board of governors, IIT Kanpur. A key accused behind the NEET-UG 2024 exam paper leak, Ravi Atri, has been arrested by the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (STF). Atri, from Neemka village in Greater Noida, is known for his alleged involvement in previous exam paper leaks across various states. His modus operandi allegedly involved uploading solved question papers on social media platforms through a network known as the ‘solver gang’. Bihar police detained six people from Jharkhand’s Deoghar district in connection with alleged irregularities surrounding the NEET medical entrance exam.

(File image: PTI) The union government removed Subodh Kumar Singh, director-general of the National Testing Agency (NTA), in an order issued late on Saturday evening, replacing him with retired IAS officer Pradeep Singh Kharola. According to the order issued by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, 1985-batch Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer Kharola, chairman and managing director of India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO), has been assigned the charge of DG NTA “till further appointment of a regular incumbent or until further orders…” The order also stated that it has placed the services of Singh, a 1997-batch IAS officer, on “compulsory wait in the Department of Personnel and Training”. The move comes amid allegations of irregularities in the NTA following the conduct of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET-UG) this year, cancellation of the University Grants Commission National Eligibility Test (UGC-NET) due to a paper leak on the darknet, and postponement of the CSIR-UGC-NET. Hours before the Centre’s order on Saturday, the ministry of education (MoE) announced the forming of a seven-member high-level panel to ensure “transparent, smooth and fair conduct of examinations” through the National Testing Agency (NTA). The panel will be led by Dr K Radhakrishnan, formerly chief of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and now chairman of the Board of Governors (BoG) of IIT-Kanpur. According to the ministry, the panel will recommend reforms in the mechanism of the examination process, improvement in data security protocols, and structure and functioning of the NTA. Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan wrote on social media site X: “Transparent, tamper-free and zero-error examinations is a commitment. Setting up of the high-level committee of experts is the first of a series of step to improve efficiency of the examination process, put an end to all possible malpractices, strengthen data security protocols and overhaul and reform the NTA. Student interests and their bright future will always be our govt’s top priority.” Pradhan on Thursday announced that the ministry will be forming a high-level panel to review the functioning of the NTA, saying that its working needs improvement. “The reforms in mechanism of examination process will involve analysis of end-to-end examination process and suggest measures to improve efficiency of the system and to forestall any possible breach,” the ministry said. It will also include conducting a thorough review of the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and protocols of the NTA and suggest measures to strengthen these procedures/protocols along with monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance at every level. According to the ministry, the panel will evaluate the existing data security processes and protocols of NTA and recommend measures for its improvement. “It will also examine existing security protocols related to paper-setting and other processes for different examinations and make recommendations to enhance robustness of system,” it said. The committee will also make recommendations on the organisational structure and functioning of the NTA for implementation of recommendations and clearly defining the roles and responsibilities of functionaries at every level. “The expert panel will assess the current Grievance Redressal Mechanism of the NTA, identify areas of improvement and make recommendations for enhancing its efficiency,” the ministry said. The panel shall submit its report to the minister within two months from the date of issue of this order. Meanwhile, it can co-opt any subject matter expert to assist it.

(Representative/PTI Photo) NEET-PG Entrance Examination, conducted by the National Board of Examination for medical students, has been postponed as a “precautionary measure” in the wake of recent allegations on the integrity of certain competitive exams. Fresh dates for the examinations will be announced soon, the Health Ministry said on Saturday. The exam was scheduled to take place on June 23. “Taking into consideration, the recent incidents of allegations regarding the integrity of certain competitive examinations, the Ministry of Health has decided to undertake a thorough assessment of the robustness of processes of NEET-PG Entrance Examination,” the ministry said in an official statement. “It has accordingly been decided, as a precautionary measure to postpone the NEET-PG Entrance Examination, scheduled to be held tomorrow i.e. 23rd June, 2024. Fresh date of this examination will be notified at the earliest,” it added. The Health Ministry further expressed regrets over the inconvenience caused to the students. “This decision has been taken in the best interests of the students and to maintain the sanctity of the examination process,” the added. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh took to his official X account and attacked the government for the postponement of the NEET UG exams. He said, “No day is complete without news of cancellation of an exam because of the total incompetence of the non- biological PM and the people around him. The latest exam to be put off is NEET-PG, which was scheduled to be held tomorrow.” NCP Spokesperson Clyde Crasto also attacked the ruling government and called this a continuous failure of the Education Department of the centre. Taking to X, he said, “Due to their inability to do their job, the government is playing with the lives and future of children. By sacking the #NTA DG (Exam Body Chief), Union Education Minister Mr. Dharmendra Pradhan cannot absolve himself from his failure in doing his duty. He should also step down as minister and accept accountability for all the mess and malpractices in the examination process in our country.” On postponing NEET PG exam, Congress leader Pawan Khera said, “NEET PG exam which was supposed to be held tomorrow has been postponed tonight…This government is not able to conduct exams. This government has completely lost its trust among the youth. The Education Minister who was giving a clean chit to NTA 4 days ago, is now removing the Director General of NTA. Who is responsible for the exams? Who is being saved? When will this investigation happen? When will this government be able to get the exam done properly? People are not getting answers to these questions.” Stay ahead with all the exam results updates on News18 Website ."

    "article_content": "PTI Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 10:18 IST Mumbai, India Students and their parents must not believe in rumours, since all objections raised were addressed and fully resolved, Dilip Sardesai, commissioner of MHT-CET said (Representational/ File Photo) Maharashtra was the first state in the country to conduct the admission process for professional courses in a computerised and centralised manner, and this method was later adopted by the Union government as it is totally transparent and free from human intervention, a top official said on Saturday. Students and their parents, therefore, must not believe in rumours, since all objections raised were addressed and fully resolved, Dilip Sardesai, commissioner of Maharashtra State Common Entrance Test (MHT-CET), told reporters. “The state common entrance examination cell conducted the MHT -CET 2024 entrance examination for engineering, pharmacy and agriculture courses between April 22 and 30 (PCB group) and from May 2 to 16 (PCM group). The examinations were conducted at 169 examination centres. The PCB group examinations were conducted in 12 sessions, whereas PCM tests were held in 18 sessions,” he said. A total of 3, 30,988 male students as well as 3 ,94 ,033 female students and 31 transgender candidates registered their name through an online system, of which 6,75,377 students appeared for the common entrance test, the official informed. Sardesai said there was no negative marking for incorrect answers and the results were declared using the percentile method, and no candidate got grace marks, he pointed out at a press conference here. “If the candidate or their parents had any objection regarding the questions or answers, the CET cell provided them with an online facility for registering their objections. These objections were verified by the respective subject experts and, accordingly, the answer sheets were modified. The report of the modified answer sheets was published on the CET cell website,” Sardesai said. The result process was implemented after incorporating the revised answer sheets as per the suggestions of the subject experts, he said, adding the marks obtained by candidates were declared according to the formula of the result process and the session wise results were declared in the form of percentile. The candidate who had equal marks, also called ‘raw score’, in a single session were given equal percentile, he said. “Similarly, the tests were conducted on different days in two sessions each, so the ‘raw score’ related to various sessions and the percentile of the candidates are different. The objection that the candidates did not get the marks they scored as per the answer sheets made available to them is also incorrect,” he said. “The objections that were registered by the candidates have been verified by the respective subject experts and the answer sheets had been modified accordingly. The report was published on cetcell.mahacet.org site of CET cell for the information of the candidates. The process of the results was implemented as per the amended answer sheets,” he said. The marks obtained by the candidates have been declared in the form of session wise percentile, following the formula set for the process of result, he said. The examinations are held in different batches but a single merit list is declared, Sardesai said. Another objection was that the question papers for each batch are different but the result of each session is calculated independently, the official said. “This procedure had been made available on the website of CET cell. It was published in April 2024 well in advance before the commencement of the examination. Therefore, this objection is also incorrect,” he said. Till date, about 200 candidates and parents had filed the applications with the CET cell, Mumbai office and many applications were received via email, and all these were verified, addressed and resolved, Sardesai said. A total of 54 candidates, whose objections were accepted for consideration, were refunded the amount deposited by them using online mode in their bank accounts, he said. “The results of the examinations are declared batch wise for providing equal opportunity to all the candidates in each and every session and this examination pattern has been implemented since 2018-19,” Sardesai said.

Familiarity with current events might help you in both the preliminary and main exams for UPSC CSE and other government admission tests. From the Centre’s measures to curb malpractices in entrance exams to the Hooch tragedy in Tamil Nadu, take a look at what happened in the country this week: Amid growing controversy over the alleged discrepancy in NEET UG 2024 and UGC NET exams, the central government notified the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Methods) Act, 2024. The act aims to curb paper leaks and other unfair practices in various national exams including UPSC, SSC, NEET, JEE, and CUET. According to the provisions of this Act, anyone found guilty of a paper leak or tampering with answer sheets faces a minimum three-year jail sentence, which can be increased to five years, and a fine of up to Rs 10 lakh. The Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Methods) Act, 2024, came into force on June 21. Delhi’s Rouse Avenue court on June 20 granted bail to Aam Aadmi Party’s national convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in a money laundering case connected to the alleged liquor policy scam. The court ordered Kejriwal to furnish a Rs 1 lakh bail bond. The bail decision, however, was put on hold by the Delhi High Court after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) challenge. Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government approved hiked Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for 14 kharif season crops during the first meeting of the Union Cabinet and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on June 19. Announcing the decision, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said that the Cabinet has approved an increase in the MSP for paddy from Rs 117 to Rs 2,300 per quintal for the 2024-25 season. The Union Cabinet has given a green signal to the Airports Authority of India’s (AAI) expansion plans for Varanasi’s Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport. The proposed plan entails the construction of a new terminal building, an apron extension, a runway extension, a parallel taxi track, and other related works. The estimated cost is stated to be about Rs 2869.65 crore. A cargo train rammed into the stationary Sealdah-bound Kanchanjungha Express in West Bengal’s Darjeeling district on June 17, killing at least nine people and injuring 41 more. The accident occurred near Rangapani station, 30 km from New Jalpaiguri station. Railway Board Chairperson Jaya Varma Sinha stated that the initial investigation suggested that it was a “human error” that led to the accident. The official added that the crash happened because the freight train ignored the signal. The death toll from the hooch tragedy in Tamil Nadu’s Kallakurichi area has risen to 48. Over 100 victims of the tragedy are receiving treatment at various hospitals. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin has announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for families of 34 people who died after consuming illicit arrack. The Tamil Nadu Police has arrested four persons in connection with this case. Stalin has also ordered officials to create a one-man committee, to give recommendations on how to prevent future events and investigate the causes of the fatalities.

An official at St Joseph’s Senior Secondary School in Chandigarh’s Sector-44 said the gates were to be closed at 1:30 pm. After neither student turned up for the retest, the authorities shut the gates. The re-exam was held from 2 pm to 5:20 pm. The National Testing Agency (NTA) conducted a retest for 1,563 students awarded grace marks in the Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test Undergraduate (NEET-UG) to make up for time loss at six centres. As many as 67 students scored a perfect 720, unprecedented in the NTA’s history, with six from a centre in Haryana’s Faridabad figuring in the list, raising suspicions about irregularities. The official said necessary arrangements were put in place for the re-exam. Chandigarh Police personnel were also deployed. NEET-UG is conducted for admissions to MBBS, BDS, AYUSH and other related courses in government and private institutions. This year, the exam was held on May 5, with around 24 lakh candidates appearing for it. The results were announced on June 4. Since then, there have been allegations of question paper leaks in states such as Bihar and other irregularities. The allegations have led to protests in several cities and filing of petitions in various high courts as well as the Supreme Court. Facing flak over the alleged discrepancies in the exam, the Centre on Saturday shunted out NTA Director General Subodh Singh and handed over the probe into the irregularities to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The Union education ministry also set up a seven-member panel to review the agency’s functioning and recommend exam reforms. The CBI has filed an FIR in connection with the alleged irregularities, officials said on Sunday. Stay ahead with all the exam results updates on News18 Website ."

The arrests were made in Prayagraj, the STF said in a statement. The exam, conducted by the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC), was held across the state on February 11. The state government cancelled the exam on March 2, following reports that the paper was leaked. Those arrested are — Sunil Raghuvanshi, a resident of Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh and a printing press worker, Subhash Prakash, a resident of Madhubani in Bihar, Vishal Dubey and Sandeep Pandey (residents of Prayagraj), Amarjeet Sharma, a resident of Gaya (Bihar), and Vivek Upadhyay, a resident of Ballia. A laptop, six mobile phones and five blank cheques were seized from them, the STF said. Prior to this, 10 people were arrested in this connection. A case under sections 419 (punishment for cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 465 (punishment for forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will etc.), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), 34 (common intention), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information to screen offender) of the IPC has been lodged at the Civil Lines police station in Prayagraj. Charges under the Uttar Pradesh Public Examination Act, 1998 and Information Technology Act have also been slapped on the arrested accused, police said. The STF also said that during interrogation of the arrested accused, it was found that the question paper of the said examination was leaked in two ways. First, this question paper was leaked from the examination centre itself on the day of the examination on February 11 at around 06.30 am before the commencement of the examination by scanning it with the help of mobile phones by Kamlesh Kumar Pal alias KK, Dr. Sharad Singh Patel, Saurabh Shukla, Arun Singh and Arpit Vineet Yashwant, who looks after the examination work of Bishop Johnson Girls School and College Prayagraj. All five have already been arrested by the UP STF and sent to jail in this connection, they said. The second way in which the said question paper was leaked was from the printing press. Sunil Raghuvanshi, an employee of the press, was involved in this, the STF said. On February 3, Raghuvanshi was present in the press on the pretext of repairing the machine. Upon getting an opportunity, he came out of the press with his drinking water bottle and brought the question paper out by hiding it inside, they said. He took the question paper to his house and kept it there. He informed Vishal Dubey about this and Dubey told Rajiv Nayan Mishra alias Rahul and Subhash Prakash. After this, it was decided among these people that on February 8, they will gather at Komal Hotel with the candidates and solvers. The question paper will be solved by the solvers in the hotel itself and the candidates will be made to read it. Rajiv Nayan Mishra alias Rahul and his gang members had fixed Rs 12 lakh each from each candidate, they said. On February 8, as per the pre-planned plan, Vishal Dubey first reached Komal Hotel along with Sandeep Pandey. After this, Sunil Raghuvanshi reached there after getting 06-06 photocopies of the question paper. Following reports of the paper leak, the Uttar Pradesh government on March 2 cancelled the preliminary exam conducted on February 11 for the recruitment of review officers (ROs) and assistant review officers (AROs). Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had then directed that the exam be conducted again within six months. The STF was assigned the task to investigate the matter.

(File image: PTI) A CBI team from Delhi reached the office of the Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of the Bihar Police in Patna on Monday morning in connection with its investigation into the allegations of irregularities in medical entrance exam NEET-UG, officials said. The EOU, which had been investigating the matter until the Centre ordered a probe by the CBI, has arrested 18 people in connection with the case, they said. “The CBI officers are collecting evidence related to the case from the EOU,” an official said. The CBI had on Sunday filed an FIR in connection with the alleged irregularities in NEET-UG, which was held on May 5, on a reference from the Education Ministry, amid countrywide protests and litigations by students. “The evidence collected by the EOU during the course of investigation include pieces of the burnt question paper recovered from a house in Patna, mobile phones of those arrested, SIM cards, laptops, post-dated cheques and reference questions papers provided by the National Testing Agency (NTA),” an EOU officer said. “All those arrested are in judicial custody in Patna, and the CBI team may take them to Delhi for detailed interrogation by obtaining transit remand from a court here,” he said. The CBI is also likely to file multiple FIRs in connection with the matter to probe the destruction of evidence, and also register disproportionate assets (DA) cases against some of those accused who are public servants, he said. “A DA case may be registered against arrested accused Sikander Prasad Yadvendu, a junior engineer in Danapur Town Council, as he reportedly acquired huge assets that are disproportionate to his known source of income,” the officer said. Yadvendu, originally from Samastipur, has been identified as the prime suspect in the case, he said. “He has a history of involvement in criminal activities. Before becoming a junior engineer in 2012, he worked as a contractor in Ranchi. He was previously implicated in an LED scam worth Rs 3 crore. He has served a jail sentence for his role in that case,” the officer said. Stay ahead with all the exam results updates on News18 Website ."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Vatsala Shrangi Edited By: Nitya Thirumalai News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 09:38 IST New Delhi, India When it was first set up, the NTA was only meant to conduct computer-based tests like the JEE for admission to engineering colleges as well as UGC-NET, which until this year used to be conducted online. (PTI) Mired in controversy, the National Testing Agency (NTA) is grappling with allegations of question paper leaks and irregularities in the conduct of some of the country’s largest and high-stakes entrance exams, including the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for medical aspirants. Constituted in 2017 by the BJP government to conduct entrance examination admissions to higher education institutions, the testing agency is an autonomous body under the Department of Higher Education in the Union Ministry of Education. What is it that has troubled the NTA? Insiders say it is the lack of a robust process and mechanism to handle such large examinations where more than 20 lakh students sit for an exam in a single day. “This is what the high-level panel aims to address,” an official told News18. The NTA is facing allegations of irregularities in the conduct of the NEET-UG 2024, for which 24 lakh candidates had registered. Arrests have been made in Bihar where accused have detailed how they received the question paper on the eve of the exam. Then there is the cancellation of the University Grants Commission National Eligibility Test (UGC-NET) due to paper leak on the darknet. Around 9 lakh students had taken the exam. Days later came the postponement of the CSIR-UGC-NET (conducted for fellowship in sciences and industrial research in universities), which affects over 2 lakh students. Last week, Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, acknowledging the issue, announced the setting up of a seven-member high-level panel led by former ISRO chief K Radhakrishnan to review the functioning of the NTA. The panel is likely to hold its first meeting on Monday, said officials. When it was first set up, the NTA was only meant to conduct computer-based tests like the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) for admission to engineering colleges as well as University Grants Commission-National Eligibility Test (UGC-NET), which until this year used to be conducted online. The NTA would partner with a technical service provider to conduct the online exams, which have been foolproof. This year, the UGC shifted the mode of examination to OMR (pen-and-paper optical mark recognition) mode, in which around 9 lakh students appeared in two shifts in a single day. “Conducting large national-level exams such as these in the pen-and-paper mode requires huge manpower and various levels of human interference starting from setting the question paper to printing and transporting it to different centres, allowing the exam to be exposed to gaps at every stage,” said an official formerly associated with the NTA. The UGC had earlier said that it shifted the exam from online mode to pen-and-paper mode to be able to conduct the exam across centres in a single day. This is the first time in 34 years that UGC-NET exam was leaked and then cancelled. Several officials also pointed out that bringing the NEET-UG under the NTA was not the right move to begin with. NEET-UG came under the NTA in 2019 after the approval of the Union Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education. “NEET-UG is India’s largest exam, which the health ministry has so far insisted on conducting in the pen-and-paper mode. Shifting the conduct of such a large-scale exam to the testing agency, which is handling a slew of other national and state level exams in itself was not the right thing to do. It can still be reversed,” said an official formerly with the Department of Higher Education. To conduct such a high-stakes exam, a separate body is needed with specific protocols just as in the case of the Union Public Services Commission (UPSC), the official added. Now, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is probing both the NEET and NET paper leak cases after the Bihar Economic Offences Unit (EOU) submitted its report to the Centre. “A high-level panel that has members from various universities is set to meet on Monday. It is supposed to discuss laying down of security protocols at each stage, including establishing a robust procedure for conduct of any exam by the NTA. This also includes rules of evaluation and setting of the question paper to its printing and distribution,” said an official familiar with the panel. The committee will also look at data security protocols used in the conduct of exams like JEE-Advanced, which is held in the computer mode. “The panel is to discuss strengthening of the second and third-rung leadership levels, assigning responsibility and fixing accountability at each level, which was likely amiss so far,” the official added."

By using the ‘KEAM-2024 Candidate Portal’ link, candidates may access their student portal at cee.kerala.gov.in. If two or more applicants receive the same score on the entrance exam, the following tie-breaking mechanism will be used to produce the KEAM 2024 rank list. 1. Candidates with higher scores on the KEAM 2024 Mathematics test will be granted a higher ranking. 2. Candidates who score higher on the physics exam will obtain a higher ranking. 3. Candidates with better class 12 maths results will receive higher rankings. 4. If the individual achieves a higher score on their class 12 Physics exam, they will be given a higher rank. 5. If the previous criteria do not result in the same marks, age is the final factor used to break ties. Those who are older will be ranked higher than those who are younger. To compute the marks, applicants must match the answer options provided in the answer key to those chosen in the exam. While doing so, applicants must add +4 marks for each correct answer and deduct -1 mark for each incorrect response. Candidates will be able to see their estimated scores once all of the questions have had their marks added or subtracted.

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 16:58 IST Bihar, India The candidate, Anurag Yadav, said in his confession statement that the NEET-UG question paper he was made to memorize on the night of May 4, 2024 and the one he received the next day at the exam centre were the same. (PTI) A candidate, his uncle and two middlemen have been arrested in Bihar for allegedly leaking the question paper of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (UG) 2024 on the eve of the May 5 examination. As per their confession statements to the police accessed by News18, two middlemen named Nitish Kumar and Amit Anand became friends with one Sikandar P Yadavendu who worked as a junior engineer in the Danapur Municipal Council. During their conversations, the duo boasted to Yadavendu that they could help any candidate clear any competitive exam by leaking the question paper and that they charge Rs 30-35 lakh per candidate. Yadavendu then allegedly told them about his nephew Anurag Yadav and three other students. In his confession, Yadavendu said he charged the boys Rs 40 lakh each and intended to pocket the difference. All four confessions mention how the boys were taken to the middlemen on the night of May 4, the eve of the exam, and were made to memorise the question paper and the answers. The candidate Anurag Yadav mentioned the paper he had memorized and the one he received the next day at the exam centre were the same. All four were arrested by the police when Yadavendu was caught during a vehicle check on May 5. Here’s a look at their purported confession statements to the Shastri Nagar police: “My name is Sikandar P Yadavendu, age 56 years… I am giving my statement without fear or pressure, without greed or temptation before the inspector at Shastri Nagar Police Station. I became friends with Amit Anand and Nitish Kumar in the Nagar Parishad office and we kept talking and sharing our stories for a long time. During these conversations, I was told by Amit Anand and Nitish Kumar that they can a child passed in any exam/competition by leaking the question paper. When I told them about the NEET exam, they told me they will charge Rs 30-32 lakh to get a child to pass the NEET exam. I agreed and we kept meeting from time to time. I told them I know four boys — Ayush Kumar, age 19, son of Abhishek Kumar, resident of Sultanpur in Patna district; Anurag Yadav, age 22, son of Sanjeev Kumar, resident of Parida in Samastipur district; Abhishek Kumar, age 21, son of Awadhesh Kumar, resident of Kako Block Gokhool Marg in Ranchi district; and Shivnandan Kumar, age 19, son of Ramswaroop Yadav, resident of Haraiya in Gaya district. I went to Ramakrishna Nagar on the night of May 4 and 5, 2024 with the boys. Amit Anand and Nitish Kumar brought the question paper and made everyone memorise it along with the answers so that they could pass the exam. Meanwhile, out of greed, I quoted Rs 40 lakh to each boy instead of Rs 30-32 lakh. On May 5, 2024, during checking of vehicles near Bailey Road, Rajvanshi Nagar, I was caught by the police of Shastri Nagar station with the admit cards of all the boys and the Renault Duster car number JH01BW0019. I confessed my crime before the police. This is my statement. I read and understood my statement and signed it after finding it to be correctly written.” “My name is Anurag Yadav, age 22 years… I am giving my statement without fear or pressure, without greed or temptation before the inspector at Shastri Nagar Police Station. I was preparing for the NEET exam at the Allen Coaching Centre in Kota. My uncle ( foofa or paternal aunt’s husband), Sikandar P Yadavendu, works as a junior engineer in the Danapur Municipal Council. He told me there is a NEET exam on May 5, 2024. He asked me to return from Kota and that exam setting has been done. I returned from Kota and my uncle left me with Amit Anand and Nitish Kumar on the night of May 4, 2024. I was given the question paper and answer sheet of the NEET exam and was made to read and memorise it that night. My centre was DY Patil School and when I went to the school to write the exam, I found the same questions in the exam paper that I had memorised correctly. After the exam, the police came and caught me. I confessed to my crime. This is my statement. I read and understood my statement and after finding it correct, I signed it.” “My name is Nitish Kumar, age 32 years… I am giving my statement without fear or pressure, without greed or temptation before the inspector at Shastri Nagar Police Station. My friend Sikandar P Yadavendu… works as a junior engineer in Danapur Municipal Council. I met him in the office of Danapur Municipal Council with Amit Anand. I had gone there for some personal work. During our conversations, I told him that I can leak the question paper of any competitive exam and help a child pass. During the conversations, Sikandar Yadavendu told me that he knows 4-5 boys who are preparing for NEET and asked me to help them pass the exam. In return, Amit Anand and I told him that it will cost Rs 30-32 lakh. Sikandar Yadavendu agreed. He said he will introduce us to four boys. Meanwhile, the NEET exam was scheduled and Sikandar Yadavendu asked us when he should call the four boys. Amit called them on the night of May 4, 2024 where the question paper of the NEET exam was leaked and all the candidates were made to read and memorise it along with the answers. When Sikandar Yadavendu was caught by the police, we were also caught based on the information given by Sikandar Yadavendu. Burnt remains of the question paper and answers were seized by the police from the place where the question paper and answer material were leaked. I was jailed in 2024 by the Economic Offences Unit, Bihar on charges of leaking the question paper and malpractice in BPSC exam. I accepted my crime. This is my statement. I have read and understood my statement and signed it after finding it to be correct.” My name is Amit Anand, age 29 years… I am giving my statement without fear or pressure, without greed or temptation before the inspector at Shastri Nagar Police Station.

Meanwhile, the NEET exam was scheduled and Sikandar Yadavendu asked me when to call the four boys. I told him to call them on the night of May 4, 2025, where the NEET exam question paper was leaked and all the children were made to read and memorise it along with the answers. When Sikandar Yadavendu was caught by the police, we were also caught as per the information given by Sikandar Yadavendu. Admit cards of various exams and burnt remains of NEET exam questions and answers were seized by the police from our rented flat. I have done such things earlier also. I have accepted my crime. This is my statement. I have read and understood my statement and signed it after finding it to be correct.” The Supreme Court on Thursday sought responses from the Centre, the National Testing Agency (NTA) and others on petitions, including those seeking the scrapping of NEET-UG 2024 exam and a court-monitored probe into the alleged irregularities in the medical entrance test. The apex court also stayed further proceedings on some pleas on the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (Undergraduate)-2024 examination pending before different high courts in the country. A vacation bench of Justices Vikram Nath and SVN Bhatti said the pleas would be heard on July 8 along with other pending matters concerning the NEET-UG 2024. The examination was held on May 5 across 4,750 centres and around 24 lakh candidates took it. The results were expected to be declared on June 14 but were announced on June 4, apparently because the evaluation of the answer sheets got completed earlier. There have been allegations of question paper leaks in states like Bihar and other irregularities in the prestigious exam. The allegations have led to protests in several cities and filing of petitions in several high courts as also the Supreme Court. Scores of students protested in Delhi on June 10 seeking a probe into alleged irregularities. As many as 67 students scored a perfect 720, unprecedented in the NTA’s history, with six from a centre in Haryana’s Faridabad figuring in the list, raising suspicions about irregularities. It has been alleged that grace marks contributed to 67 students sharing the top rank. The NEET-UG examination is conducted by the NTA for admissions to MBBS, BDS, AYUSH and other related courses in government and private institutions across the country."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Oliver Fredrick Edited By: Nitya Thirumalai News18.com Last Updated: June 22, 2024, 16:20 IST Bihar, India It was Sanjeev Singh 'Mukhiya' who arranged the NEET-UG 2024 question paper and handed it over to one Rocky who is still at large, a Bihar Police source told News18. (Photo credit: News18 India) Six middlemen, four students and three parents – a total of 13 people – have been arrested so far in connection with the NEET-UG 2024 paper leak case. The most startling confessions have come from four accused arrested in Bihar – a student, his uncle and two middlemen – whose purported statements to the police detail how four candidates were made to memorise the question paper and answers on the eve of the May 5 examination for a price of Rs 40 lakh per candidate. But who is the brain behind this hydra-headed operation; who leaked the question paper of the medical entrance exam in the first place? Bihar Police’s Economic Offences Unit (EOU), which is investigating the NEET-UG paper leak case, has refused to comment, but sources in Bihar Police told News18 that questioning of those arrested so far yielded the name of one Sanjeev ‘Mukhiya’, the alleged mastermind of the racket who remains at large. Is Sanjeev ‘Mukhiya’ the first link in the chain, the initial source of the paper leak? Officially, the Bihar Police are tightlipped. But sources within the police force say the investigation so far has led to this resident of Bihar’s Nalanda district. But who is Sanjeev ‘Mukhiya’? To begin with, sources say, his name is not ‘Mukhiya’. His actual name is said to be Sanjeev Singh and his wife Mamta Devi was elected the ‘ mukhiya ’ or chief of the Bhuthakhar Panchayat, following which even Sanjeev came to be addressed as ‘ mukhiya ’. His wife had also unsuccessfully contested the 2020 Bihar elections from Harnaut seat on a Lok Jan Shakti Party (LJNSP) ticket, emerging the first runner-up. “It was Sanjeev who arranged the question paper and handed it over to one ‘Rocky’ who is still at large,” a police source told News18, adding that this is not first time Sanjeev’s name has cropped up in a paper leak investigation. “His name has come up in paper leak cases of many competitive exams and he has also faced jail,” the source said. Sanjeev’s son, a doctor by profession, is also said to be currently in jail for alleged involvement in a Bihar teacher recruitment exam paper leak case. Together, the father-son duo is allegedly part of the ‘Mukhiya Solver Gang’, a notorious group believed to be involved in exam frauds. Sanjeev ‘Mukhiya’, a resident of Nagarsauna in Nalanda district of Bihar, is a technical assistant at Nalanda College’s Noorsarai branch. Formerly employed at Sabour Agricultural College, he was transferred to Noorsarai after being implicated in similar paper leak scandal, leading to his arrest by Uttarakhand Police in 2016. He has not been seen since May 6, 2024 when his name cropped up in connection with the NEET-UG 2024 paper leak. Multiple arrests into the paper leak in Bihar, Rajasthan and Delhi strengthened suspicions of his involvement, say police sources. The Nalanda College administration confirmed his absence. Sanjeev ‘Mukhiya’, however, has not been completely missing in action. He denies any wrongdoing, claims he is being framed and has applied for anticipatory bail through his lawyer in Patna Sadar’s ACGM 9 Court. Bihar Police officials say it all began with a phone call on May 5, the day the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (Undergraduate) or NEET (UG) was held. “We never imagined that a simple tip-off could lead to the high-profile gang involved in the NEET-UG paper leak, which has become a national controversy,” an officer said on condition of anonymity. The call had come from a Jharkhand-based central agency which alerted the Bihar Police to a gang involved in leaking the NEET-UG 2024 question paper. The inputs contained the details of the car being used by the accused. “We acted swiftly and tracked the car. We found the alleged members of the organized gang allegedly involved in the NEET-UG exam leak,” said a senior official with the Bihar Police. The discovery was the tip of the iceberg. Further investigation led the police to 13 people allegedly involved in the racket, including students and their parents. Police officials who are part of the investigation told News18 that the gang charged Rs 30 to Rs 50 lakh from the aspirants and used to accommodate them in small lodges in Patna where the students were provided the question papers to be memorised. Middleman Amit Anand reportedly told the police during interrogation that he and his associates used to provide aspirants with the leaked question paper and answers on the eve of the exam. The aspirants were made to memorise the questions and solutions overnight. In his confession statement to police, Anand allegedly admitted that his gang used to charge up to Rs 32 lakh per aspirant. Anand’s statement was corroborated by the purported confession statement of Ayush Kumar, who appeared for the NEET-UG exam at DAV School and was later detained from the centre. “Ayush confessed that he had received the NEET-UG question paper on Saturday night, a day before the exam that was held on May 5. He said that the question paper he got was the same as the one distributed at the examination centre. Ayush added that 25 other candidates like him were made to memorise the answers to the question paper that was given to them in the premises of Learn Boys Hostel and Learn Play School,” another Bihar Police officer told News18. In his confession statement, Sikander Prasad Yadvendu, a junior engineer at Danapur Town Council, reportedly confessed to introducing four aspirants, including his nephew Anurag Yadav, to the middlemen. He also allegedly confessed to charging the boys Rs 40 lakh per person, intending to pocket the difference. When contacted, Manabjit Singh Dhillon, DIG, Economic Offences Wing, Bihar Police, told News18: “As the hearing of the Supreme Court regarding NEET case is approaching on July 8, so we have been advised by our counsel to not let the investigative part being published/broadcasted in media as some news items tend to interpret the news which may prejudice the stand of the EOU and prosecution in the Supreme Court. So, now only the official press release, if needed, will be released officially with the consent of ADG, EOU.” The Supreme Court on Friday refused to defer the NEET-UG counselling process, scheduled to kick off on July 6, saying it is not an “open and shut” exercise, even as the political pot kept boiling over the controversy-ridden exam with the opposition attacking the Centre over alleged paper leak and other irregularities. The National Testing Agency (NTA), under fire over the lapses in the conduct of NEET and UGC-NET, is gearing up to conduct on Sunday a retest for the medical entrance exam for 1,563 candidates who were earlier awarded grace marks to make up for the loss of time at six centres."

Education Ministry Joint Secretary Govind Jaiswal had said that prima facie the government felt the exam had been compromised. “No complaints were received but the inputs we received from agencies indicated that the integrity of the exam has been compromised. The action was taken suo motu to safeguard the interests of the students,” Jaiswal had said. “9 lakh students had participated in the UGC-NET exam that the National Testing Agency (NTA) conducted on June 18. The ministry saw that there was a chance that the examination had been compromised. The ministry has decided to cancel the examination. The next date will be declared soon. The matter has been referred to the CBI,” he had added. The NET exam was cancelled amid allegations of question paper leaks in states like Bihar and other irregularities in the prestigious NEET examination."

In Thane’s fraud, a case has been registered in this connection against four persons, police told news agency PTI . Modus Operandi The accused contacted the man, working in a private company, on different occasions from March this year and made him a member of a WhatsApp group. They then asked him to get into stock trading by downloading an application and the money that he invested through it went into the accounts of the accused, PTI quoted an official as saying. When the man sought returns and the invested amount, the accused gave evasive replies. The accused subsequently filed a complaint based on which the police on Saturday registered an FIR against four persons under relevant provisions, the official said. Nagpur Case Based on a complaint, the Nagpur police have registered a case under relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act, an official said. The 60-year-old complainant allegedly received a message from his daughter’s Instagram account about investing and earning huge returns after completing online courses on an application, he said. Accordingly, he downloaded the application on his mobile phone, completed the online courses on May 16, and started getting suggestions for investments in different companies, he said.

    "article_content": "Curated By : Namit Singh Sengar News18.com Last Updated: June 10, 2024, 16:41 IST New Delhi, India Check floating interest rates of various banks Navigating the landscape of home loans can be daunting, especially with fluctuating interest rates that significantly impact long-term financial commitments. As India’s leading banks—State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank (PNB), ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank, understanding their current home loan interest rates is crucial for prospective homeowners. This story delves into the latest offerings from these financial giants, comparing their interest rates. Whether you’re a first-time buyer or looking to refinance, this guide will help you make an informed choice in the ever-evolving market of home loans. There are three main types of home loan interest rates: Fixed Interest Rate: A fixed interest rate remains constant throughout the loan tenure, resulting in a steady home loan EMI. This option is preferable when the current home loan rate of interest is fairly low, and an upward trend is expected. Floating Interest Rate: A variable or floating interest rate is subject to current market lending rates and may fluctuate during the loan term. The EMIs on house loans will increase or fall in response to changes in interest rates. This option can be beneficial if you expect interest rates to go down in the future. Hybrid Interest Rate: Hybrid home loan interest rates are a combination of fixed and floating interest rates. They will have a fixed interest rate for a defined period before switching to a fluctuating interest rate. This option can be a good choice if you want the stability of a fixed rate for a few years but also want to benefit from potential future reductions in interest rates. Home Loan Interest Rate Comparison Below is the list of floating interest rates of various banks; SBI Home Loan Interest Rates The State Bank of India offers multiple options for home loans. The rate of interest ranges from 8.50% to 11.55%. Check the chart given below; PNB Home Loan Interest Rates PNB Housing offers seamless and swift loans for a variety of needs, including home purchases, renovations, construction, and extensions. PNB Housing offers customers 30-year housing loans (up to the age of 70). PNB Housing can sanction and finance up to 90% of the house value (percentage funding depends upon the loan amount). PNB’s rate of interest ranges from 8.50% to 11.45%. Check the chart given below; Up to 35 lakh Above up to 35 lakh ICICI Bank Home Loan Interest Rates At ICICI Bank, special home loan interest rates are customised based on your credit score. These rates play a crucial role in determining the interest applicable to your home loan, ensuring fair and personalised lending. Credit Score Salaried Self – Employed 800 9.00% 9.00% 750 – 800 9.00% 9.10% Standard Home Loan Interest Rates Loan Slab Salaried Self-Employed Up to Rs 35 lakhs 9.25% – 9.65% 9.40% – 9.80% Rs 35 lakhs to Rs 75 lakhs 9.50% – 9.80% 9.65% – 9.95% Above Rs 75 lakhs 9.60% – 9.90% 9.75% -10.05% HDFC Bank Home Loan Interest Rates HDFC Bank provides attractive home finance interest rates starting from 8.75% per annum. These rates apply to home loans, balance transfer loans, house renovation loans, and home extension loans. HDFC Bank offers both adjustable-rate (floating rate) loans and fixed loans. With fixed loans, the interest rate remains fixed for a specified period (such as the first two years of the loan tenure) before switching to an adjustable rate. Adjustable Home Loan Rates All rates are benchmarked to the Policy Repo Rate, which is currently 6.50%. Special Home Loan Rates for Salaried & Self-Employed (Professionals & Non-Professionals) Loan Slab Interest Rates (% p.a.) For All Loans Policy Repo Rate + 2.25% to 3.15% = 8.75% to 9.65% Standard Home Loan Rates for Salaried & Self Employed (Professionals & Non-Professionals) Loan Slab Interest Rates (% p.a.) For All Loans Policy Repo Rate + 2.90% to 3.45% = 9.40% to 9.95% These rates are linked to HDFC Bank’s repo rate and may vary throughout the loan tenure. The information provided on home loan interest rates for SBI, PNB, ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank is for informational purposes only and represents typical ranges at the time of writing. Interest rates are subject to change frequently based on various factors, including the bank’s internal policies, market conditions, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines. Before finalising any home loan, thoroughly read and understand all the terms and conditions of the loan agreement. Pay close attention to prepayment clauses, lock-in periods, and any exit charges."

Equity mutual funds witnessed staggering growth with inflow reaching a record high of Rs 34,697 crore in May, marking an 83 per cent surge from the preceding month, propelled by contributions from thematic funds and intermittent corrections that provided buying opportunities to investors. This also marks the 39th consecutive month of net inflows in equity funds, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) showed on Monday. Also Read: BSE Clarifies June 4 Mutual Fund NAV Delay: Payment Lag from Banks, No Technical Glitch Moreover, monthly contributions from Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) rose to Rs 20,904 crore in May, from Rs 20,371 crore in April, marking the second consecutive month of inflows exceeding Rs 20,000 crore. Overall, the mutual fund industry has witnessed an inflow of Rs 1.1 lakh crore in the month under review as compared to Rs 2.4 lakh crore in April. The inflow was due to investment in equity as well as debt schemes. With these inflows, the industry’s net assets under management rose to Rs 58.91 lakh crore in May-end from Rs 57.26 lakh crore in April-end. As per the data, equity-oriented schemes witnessed an inflow of Rs 34,697 crore in May, way higher than Rs 18,917 crore in April. Except for the focused and equity-linked saving schemes (ELSS) categories, all the other categories witnessed good net inflows. Sector/thematic funds continue to attract investor attention with the highest net inflows of Rs 19,213 crores during the month. This was largely owing to the new fund offering (NFO) of the HDFC Manufacturing Fund, which collected around Rs 9,563 crore. “Intermittent corrections provided investors some buying opportunity in a market which has largely witnessed a secular uptrend for a long time now. Moreover, the expectation of the NDA-led government coming back to power also propelled buying from investors, as they would have expected the markets to rally further if the NDA government is indeed formed,” Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director – Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India, said. Manish Mehta, national head of sales, marketing & digital business at Kotak Mahindra AMC, said that record inflows were aided by NFO listings and investors taking advantage of volatility to add equity schemes to their investments through SIPs as well as lumpsum. “The record inflow in May came despite high volatility from FPI selling and general elections. Investors remained steadfast in their pursuit of returns on the back of the Indian growth narrative, buoyed by confidence in the incumbent government securing a record third consecutive term, Gopal Kavalireddi, Vice President of Research at FYERS, said. Apart from equities, debt category schemes experienced net inflows of Rs 42,495 crore on preference for safety which drove the flow in the segment. Liquid funds recorded inflows of Rs 25,873.38 crore. “Given the uncertainty surrounding the interest rate cycle, most of the flows have flowed into categories having a duration profile of less than a year such as ultrashort and money market. Significant flows have also been received by overnight and liquid fund categories, but that is largely corporates and institution driven and usually of very short tenure,” Srivastava said. The categories that witnessed net outflows are short duration, medium duration, dynamic bond, credit risk, gilt fund and floater fund. Besides, hybrid category schemes attracted Rs 17,991 crore and index funds and other ETFs collectively garnered Rs 15,180 crore. What Is SIP In Mutual Fund? SIP stands for Systematic Investment Plan. It’s a popular method for investing in mutual funds that allows you to invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, like monthly or quarterly, instead of a lump sum investment.

Capital markets regulator Sebi on Monday eased rules for existing investors by abolishing the norm of freezing demat accounts and mutual fund folios in case of failure to provide a ‘choice of nomination’. Additionally, investors holding securities in physical form would be eligible for receipt of any payment, including dividend, interest, or redemption payment as well as to lodge grievances or avail any service request from the RTA (Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents) even if they did not submit ’choice of nomination’. Also Read: Mutual Fund SIP At New High Of Rs 20,904 Cr, Equity Inflow Surges To Rs 34,697 Cr In May Earlier, the regulator set June 30, 2024, as the deadline for all existing individual mutual fund holders to nominate or opt out of nomination. Failure to comply with the rule could have led to the freezing of their accounts for withdrawals. Based on representations received from the market participants, for ease of compliance and investor convenience, Sebi has decided that for existing investors or unitholders, non-submission of ‘choice of nomination’ will not result in the freezing of demat accounts as well as mutual fund folios, according to a circular on Monday. The regulator said that payments withheld presently by the listed companies or RTAs for not submitting a ‘choice of nomination’ will be processed accordingly. Sebi further said that all new investors/unitholders would continue to be required to mandatorily provide the ‘choice of nomination’ for demat accounts/ mutual fund folios (except for jointly held demat accounts and mutual fund folios). The regulator has asked depository participants, AMCs or RTAs to encourage the demat account holders or mutual fund unitholders, respectively, to update ‘choice of nomination’ by sending a communication on a fortnightly basis by way of emails and SMS to all such investors, who have not provided the ’choice of nomination’. The communication should guide Demat account holders/ mutual fund unit holders to provide a ‘choice of nomination’. To encourage the existing investors to provide a ‘choice of nomination’, a pop-up would be provided on the web or mobile platform to the investors by depositories and depository participants while logging into the demat account and by AMCs while logging into their MF account from October 1. Also, the regulator has provided a format for nomination and opting out of nomination in both the demat account and MF folios. It said that only three fields must be provided mandatorily for updating nomination details — the nominee’s name, nominee’s share, and relationship with the applicant. Why does Nomination Matter? Nomination in mutual funds is crucial for a smooth and hassle-free transfer of your invested money to your loved ones in case of your unfortunate demise. With a nominee, your designated person can claim the mutual fund units with minimal paperwork, compared to the lengthy legal process involving a will or inheritance. Nomination helps prevent conflicts among family members regarding inheritance, especially if there’s no will. (With PTI inputs)"

The insurance regulator IRDAI announced on Wednesday that all life insurance savings products must now include a policy loan option, allowing policyholders to access liquidity when needed. In a master circular consolidating all regulations related to life insurance policies, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) announced that the free look period, allowing policyholders to review the terms and conditions, has been extended from 15 days to 30 days. Also Read: Record Year For Life Insurance Sector: Policies Jump, 31% Increase In Premium, Check Latest Details The latest master circular follows a similar exercise by the regulator for general insurance policies. “This is an important step in the series of reforms taken up by the insurance regulator with the interests of the policyholders at the core. A conducive environment is now facilitated to spur innovation, and enhance customer experience and satisfaction,” IRDAI said. According to the master circular, the facility of partial withdrawal under pension products is allowed enabling the policyholders to meet their specific financial needs for important life events like higher education or marriage of children; purchase/ construction of residential house/flat; medical expenses, and treatment of critical illness. In case of surrender of policies, reasonableness and value for money is to be ensured for both surrendering policyholders and continuing policyholders, IRDAI said. Further, the regulator said robust systems should be in place for the grievance redressal of policyholders. “In case the insurer does not appeal against the award of insurance ombudsman and does not implement the same within 30 days, a penalty of Rs 5,000 per day shall be payable to the complainant,” the circular said. Insurance companies have also been asked to put in place mechanisms to improve persistence, curb mis-selling and avoid financial loss to the policyholders and enhance long-term benefits to them. General Insurance Companies Can’t Reject Claims for Want of Documents General insurance companies cannot reject claims for want of documents, IRDAI said on Tuesday. The comprehensive master circular on general insurance business also repeals 13 circulars. IRDAI said the provision of easy-to-understand insurance products tailored to meet the individual needs of the customers, providing them with ample choices and enhancing their insurance experience has now been enabled. “No claim shall be rejected for want of documents. Required documents are to be called at the time of underwriting the proposal. The customer may be asked to submit only those documents necessary and related to claim settlement (if cashless is not available),” the circular said. Further, retail customers can cancel the policy anytime by informing the insurer. The insurer can cancel the policy only on grounds of established fraud. The insurer should refund a proportionate premium for the unexpired policy period on cancellation, the circular said. IRDAI has also provided strict timelines for the settlement of claims, including for the appointment of surveyors and submission of their reports. (With PTI inputs)"

(Representative image) When a new government is elected in India, investors often reassess their strategies to align with the anticipated policy changes and economic directions. Investors usually remain vigilant and adaptable, closely monitoring policy announcements and economic indicators to fine-tune their investment strategies in response to the government’s initiatives. S Ravi, founder, Ravi Rajan & Co., shared that most policies are expected to continue as the NDA is continuing the government at the centre. “Prime Minister Modi is in his third tenure as the Prime Minister, which implies that most of the policies framed in NDA one and two would continue. The Prime Minister in his allocation of the portfolio of the cabinet has preferred continuity to a large extent. This implies that most of the vision documents including Viksit Bharat would be relevant in today’s context,” Ravi said. Ravi added that NDA 2 had focused on e-mobility, infrastructure including rural infrastructure, ESG, Defence, and IT infrastructure. “Indian banking has been well capitalised and strictly regulated. Steps were taken in the case of PMC Bank, Yes Bank, and Laxmi Vilas Bank. RBI is closely regulating NBFCs, Arc, and cooperative banks,” Ravi highlighted. Looking into the future, Ravi said that the focus will be on good governance and strong regulatory measures. Ravi, who is a former chairman of the Bombay Stock Exchange, has suggested key focus areas on how to pick the right sector to invest in going forward. “We have to also understand that banks that have merged will now show more profitability and resilience,” Ravi said. The union budget is around the corner and it will certainly clearly outline the policies of the new government, Ravi concluded."

From a child’s first step to their first big achievement, fathers play a crucial role in shaping the child’s life. Apart from the love and guidance, there’s a sense of security that only a father can offer. While fathers have been shouldering financial responsibilities for decades, eventually they reach a stage when they also need financial security. Also Read: Need Cash? Thanks To IRDAI New Rules, Now Loan Facility Mandatory for Life Insurance Policies Health insurance is a must for everyone; and when it comes to safeguarding the financial stability of a family, health insurance for fathers is vital. Irrespective of the stage of life a father is at, a health insurance plan is crucial. But it becomes especially crucial once age is no longer on your side. So, health insurance is not only for a father whose children depend on him. It is also an important lifeline for elderly fathers who may be independent or may depend on their children. In this case, their children must ensure that their fathers have adequate health coverage. Moreover, it can be the perfect gift for them this Father’s Day. The good news is that the IRDAI has recently come up with a series of reforms in the health insurance space for senior citizens. Reforms in health insurance that benefit fathers The insurance landscape in the country has been evolving through the positive interventions of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, coupled with the enthusiastic response shown by the insurers. Many of these reforms have made health insurance better for fathers. This Father’s Day, consider securing a health insurance policy for your father or enhancing an already-ongoing one. It’s a gift that promises peace of mind and a healthier future, reflecting the love and care that fathers so selflessly provide. -The author is the business head, health insurance, Policybazaar.com.

    "article_content": "Published By : Mohammad Haris PTI Last Updated: June 17, 2024, 11:35 IST New Delhi, India India allows 7 per cent tariffs or customs duty concessions on import of unlimited quantities of silver and a 1 per cent concession on 160 metric tonnes of gold. CEPA was signed in February 2022 and implemented in May 2022. (Representative image) India’s gold and silver imports from its free trade agreement (FTA) partner UAE have skyrocketed 210 per cent to USD 10.7 billion in 2023-24 and there is a need to potentially revise the concessional customs duty rates under the pact to mitigate the arbitrage driving this surge, a report said on Monday. Economic think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said this sharp rise in gold and silver imports is primarily driven by import duty concessions granted by India to the UAE under the India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). India allows 7 per cent tariffs or customs duty concessions on import of unlimited quantities of silver and a 1 per cent concession on 160 metric tonnes of gold. CEPA was signed in February 2022 and implemented in May 2022. Additionally, India facilitates gold and silver imports by allowing private firms to import from the UAE through the India International Bullion Exchange (IIBX) in Gift City. Previously, only authorised agencies could handle such imports, the report said. “While India’s total imports from the UAE fell 9.8 per cent from USD 53.2 billion in FY23 to USD 48 billion in FY24, imports of gold and silver skyrocketed 210 per cent, from USD 3.5 billion to USD 10.7 billion,” it said. “Import of all remaining products fell 25 per cent, from USD 49.7 billion in FY23 to USD 37.3 billion in FY24,” it said. GTRI Founder Ajay Srivastava said the current import of gold and silver from the UAE is unsustainable as the UAE does not mine gold or silver or add sufficient value to imports. “High import duties in India on gold, silver, and jewellery at 15 per cent are at the root of the problem. Consider lowering tariffs to 5 per cent. This will cut large-scale smuggling and other misuse,” Srivastava said. Trade in gold, silver, and diamonds has been prone to misuse due to their low volume but high value and high import duties in India. Low tariff imports of gold, silver only benefit few importers who keep all profits arising through tariff arbitrage and never pass it to consumers, he said. Srivastava suggested the government implement certain measures to help India balance its trade policies, protect domestic revenue, and ensure fair competition in the import of precious metals and jewellery. It suggested reassessing and potentially revising the concessional duty rates under CEPA to mitigate the arbitrage driving the surge in imports of gold and silver. “At least, implement yearly import quotas (tariff rate quotas) for silver, similar to those for gold, to control the volume of imports and prevent revenue loss,” it said, adding that India should rigorously verify the claimed value addition by Dubai-based refiners in gold and silver imports to ensure compliance with CEPA rules of origin. It also asked to tighten regulations around the India International Bullion Exchange (IIBX) at Gift City to control the volume and nature of precious metal imports and the exchange should not allow country-based exemptions. As increased imports contribute to a higher current account deficit and since gold and silver act more like financial instruments than regular trade items, India should avoid including them in any FTA. “India has granted tariff concessions for these items in many FTAs and under the DFTP (duty-free tariff preference) scheme, so a comprehensive review is needed. India announced the scheme for LDCs (least developed countries) in 2008. Under this, India provides duty free/preferential market access on about 98.2 per cent of India’s tariff lines (or product categories). Further, the report stated that silver imports from the UAE increased multifold to USD 1.74 billion in 2023-24 from a meagre USD 29.2 million in 2022-23 due to India charging an 8 per cent duty under the CEPA versus a 15 per cent duty from other countries. “The large 7 per cent tariff arbitrage resulted in a loss of revenue for India of Rs 1,010 crore in FY24. Revenue loss will increase as India has committed to make tariffs zero on unlimited quantities of silver from the UAE within next 8 years,” it added. It said this trade is unusual because the UAE just imports large silver and gold bars, melt and convert these into silver grains and unwrought gold for exports. “A check with global refiners will show that value addition in such process is much less than 1 per cent as opposed to 3 per cent required under the FTA,” it said. On gold bars, the report said India agreed to import 200 metric tons of gold annually from the UAE with a 1 per cent tariff concession and due to this gold imports rose 147.6 per cent from USD 3 billion in FY23 to USD 7.6 billion in FY24, causing India to lose Rs 635 crore in revenue in FY24. Similarly, India’s jewellery imports have increased 187.6 per cent from USD 1.1 billion in FY23 to USD 3.3 billion in FY24, whereas these imports from the UAE have increased 290 per cent from USD 347 million in FY23 to USD 1.35 billion in the last fiscal."

    "article_content": "Written By : Yatamanyu Narain Edited By: Dishya Sharma News18.com Last Updated: May 10, 2024, 22:53 IST Mumbai, India In a mesmerizing union of noir intrigue and profound social undertones, ‘Murder In Mahim’ transcends typical crime dramas, elevating itself to a realm of deep introspection and raw authenticity. Adapted from Jerry Pinto’s riveting novel, the 8-episode series weaves a tapestry of complexity, delving not only into the dark labyrinth of crime but also into the intricate nomenclature of familial bonds and societal injustices. Through the lens of this Raj Acharya masterpiece, brilliantly shouldered by Ashutosh Rana and Vijay Raaz, viewers are compelled to confront the harsh realities of a city full of life and deceit—Mumbai. As the narrative unfolds, ‘Murder In Mahim’ challenges us to reflect on the nuanced layers of humanity, prejudice, and the eternal struggle for justice in a world where shadows dance with light. A cruddy restroom at Mahim station becomes the spot for a barbaric murder of a gay sex worker, and it opens up a Pandora’s box for Officer Shivajirao Jende (played by Vijay Raaz). On the other side of the coin is Peter Fernandes (played by Ashutosh Rana), a retired TV journalist who suspects his son Sunil (played by Rohan Verma) could be a queer after he sees him rallying for their rights. Set in a time when homosexuality was considered a crime and the LGBTQIA+ community was largely looked down upon as immoral elements of society, the investigation gets more convoluted and murkier for Inspector Jende and his subordinate Firdaus Rabbani (played by Shivani Raghuwanshi) as the spate of similar murder rocks the city, and acquaints the exteriorly tough cop with the city’s underbelly reeking of exploitation, injustice, abuse, class inequality and more. Beyond the ghastly murders, Jende negotiates his rocky relationship with his father Dhullar (played by Shivaji Satam), an ex-policeman who was implicated and later dismissed on bribery charges. The anger and frustration that simmers within Jende are often exhumed through his unpredictable temper, which deteriorates his bond with his wife and son. Meanwhile, Firdaus, hailing from an orthodox family, goes against the norm and pursues a romantic relationship with her best friend Rehana (played by Benafsha Soonawala), as she comes to terms with her sexuality but hides herself from the piercing and slated lenses of the society, clouded by bias and detestation. As the story progresses, Jende and Peter, who used to be thick as thieves at some point in their lives come face to face when Peter’s son Sunil emerges as a suspect in the case. Years of bitterness between them transcend and peel off slowly as they individually tackle their respective prejudices and biases towards different genders and sexual identities. In pursuit of the truth about his son, Peter learns about the grim and unsympathetic landscape of gay sex workers of Mahim, who hail from the marginalised strata of the society, abused and manipulated by the system and yet persevering to claim and assimilate themselves with the community. During its course, this craftily made whodunit challenges norms, dismantles the binary constructs around gender and sexuality and explores the byzantine nature of human relationships. Weaved around the engrossing thriller, several stories strike a chord and urge you to develop a more nuanced perspective on things, that are otherwise deemed unimportant and arbitrary by the majority. At its core, Murder In Mahim remains mostly honest to Jerry Pinto’s depiction of Mumbai, a wistful haven for the privileged and a ravaged battleground for the disadvantaged. The pace of the first three episodes might test your patience, if you are someone who likes to take a direct plunge into the thick of things. While slow and inconsistent, the viewers get familiarised with every character and sub-plots and their relevance to the main narrative. Although the series borrows from the textbook of familiar tropes, usually employed in thrillers like this, the characters are profoundly written, without painting them as heroes or villains. That makes them unpredictable in some scenes and pleasant in others. The thriller is inundated with characters and scenes that will leave you with a smile on your face and your heart brimming with joy, amid the ugly and chaotic crime investigation. Raj Acharya also excels in portraying the perplexing bond of friendship between Jende and Peter and their messy past. Once akin to Feluda and Topshe from Satyajit Ray’s Feluda or Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John H. Watson from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s stories, Peter and Jende navigate their fractured camaraderie and burn bridges in some of the most poignant scenes from the series. ‘Murder in Mahim’ delves deeply into the complex and often strained father-son relationships, exploring them with maturity and insight. The series artfully navigates contentious debates between Peter and Sunil as they spar over the moral dimensions of sex work and same-sex relationships. Similarly, Jende’s volatile interactions with Dhullar are portrayed with nuance, each confrontation logically unfolding to enhance the depth and development of their characters throughout the narrative. This thoughtful depiction underscores the emotional and ethical tumults that drive the story forward, lending it both authenticity and gravitas. Vijay Raaz and Ashutosh Rana bring to life the characters of Jende and Peter Fernandes with a masterful blend of precision and authenticity. Their performances were enhanced by the commendable efforts of counterparts such as Shivani Raghuvanshi, Divya Jagdale, Shivaji Satam, Bharat Ganeshpure, Rajesh Khattar, Ashutosh Gaikwad, Rohan Verma, and others. Complementing the visceral intensity of the narrative, Neel Adhikari’s background score weaves a haunting and evocative aural landscape that perfectly captures the essence of the film’s dark and compelling storyline. ‘Murder In Mahim’ transcends the boundaries of a mere investigation, evolving into a searing portrayal of a world tainted by ignorance and intolerance—a poignant reminder of the enduring struggles faced by those battling to find acceptance and justice in a realm engulfed by shadows. This coming-of-age thriller, while not devoid of flaws, makes for an engaging and thought-provoking watch, as it stands out from the pantheon of crime dramas we have at our disposal. Murder In Mahim will not only entertain you but will also go a long way in changing perceptions."

    "article_content": "Written By : Dishya Sharma News18.com Last Updated: May 16, 2024, 11:55 IST Mumbai, India IF Movie Review (2024): Growing up, most of us tend to lose our imagination to reality. The rat race of life, the demand to hit targets before deadlines and the pressure to make ‘dreams into reality’ is so high that the concept of imagination is reduced to immaturity. “I’m not a kid anymore,” screams the inner voice. But when you sit down in front of John Krasinski and Ryan Reynolds’ IF (Imaginary Friends), the voices disappear for a while, the stress is reduced and a blanket of comfort wraps you around, reminding you that it’s okay to cave into your imagination, it’s okay to revisit your inner child once a while. Starring John, Ryan and The Walking Dead’s Cailey Fleming, IF revolves around those forgotten Imaginary Friends from our childhood. With their purpose fulfilled – to be by the children who imagined them and to comfort them during their difficult times – and forgotten by the same kids once they are all grown up, these imaginary beings have no place to go. While Cal (Reynolds) tries his best to comfort them and help them find a new home, it’s not until Bea comes into their lives that the ball sets rolling. For some strange reason, Bea can see all the imaginary beings. She decides to use her ability to reunite the long lost beings with their adults. Through the film, we meet different adults and imaginary friends, all who are connected to each other in one way or the other. The film’s climax is filled with surprises, overwhelming emotions and could also leave a few (read me) in tears. IF is a children’s film made for adults. Given that John, who has starred, voiced one of the characters and directed the film, has shared that IF is inspired by his children, his honesty in the storytelling comes through. He is not here to just entertain the children but also the adults who accompany them. Through the film, he also holds you and gives you a good shake to remind you that surrender to your inner child once in a while. His direction is top notch and crisp, with the plot not detailing at any point. The writing is fresh and clear, despite the numerous characters and subplots. But the writing did have a few flaws. Even though I surrendered to his thoughts, there were a few things that I couldn’t leave to the imagination. For example, the film doesn’t give a clarity on how only Bea is able to see all the imaginary friends. The last scene of the film also left me with a crucial question. Although I am not going to reveal the spoiler, it did come as a road bump. While the film is not completely holistic, it’s visually beautiful. The imaginary characters are well displayed and even leave you in splits in many scenes. The voice actors behind the characters, especially Steve Carell as Blue and Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Blossom are fantastic. John and Ryan deliver their best as always. But the real star of the film is Cailey Fleming. She binds the film together beautifully with her performance. It’s her film out and out. Bottom line: John Krasinski, Ryan Reynolds and Cailey Fleming take you on a mesmerising journey with their imaginary friends. Just play along!"

    "article_content": "Written By : Dishya Sharma Edited By: Chirag Sehgal News18.com Last Updated: May 17, 2024, 10:41 IST Mumbai, India The Garfield Movie (2024) Review: The iconic orange cat returns to the big screen after 15 years and what a fun comeback he has had! The Garfield Movie is set to take over the cinemas this weekend and this time around, Chris Pratt is voicing the iconic cat. Now, we’ve read about Garfield’s various adventures with his best friend, the adorable dog, Odie. But in The Garfield Movie, Garfield and Odie take on a journey that they’ve never travelled before. The duo is forced to step out in the real world courtesy of Garfield’s long-lost father, Vic (Samuel L Jackson). Fans of the popular cartoon strip are introduced to Vic as a father who abandoned his son in the alley before he is rescued by Jon (Nicholas Hoult). While he grows up in the comfort of Jon’s care, Garfield and Odie get kidnapped one night by a gang of rebellious cats and dogs. Turns out, the head of the gang — a villainous Persian cat named Jinx (voiced by Hannah Waddingham). It is revealed that she seeks revenge from Vic for abandoning her during a robbery. She is sent to the pound and is forced to live an unruly life. Having seen the worst, she kidnaps Garfield and Odie in the hope that she can get to Vic. Upon their reunion, Jinx tells them that if they want her to forgive her, they would have to arrange for a massive amount of milk from a dairy farm. Forced to agree, Garfield sets off on an adventure where he learns the ways of the world. He not only learns how to survive but also meets eccentric characters who help him understand the meaning of love and family. The Garfield Movie knows its audience. It doesn’t try hard to stand out with its storyline and gags, and that’s exactly what works for the film. The film is predictable when it comes to its twists and turns, and yet the film manages to leave you in awe at several points. The Garfield Movie is out to have fun and you end up having fun with him. The film is packed with hilarious one-liners, epic nods to Tom Cruise and even ‘awwdorable’ moments featuring Garfield and his dad. It goes without saying that Chris Pratt and Samuel L Jackson have seamlessly carried the film on their shoulder. Both the actors have become a pro at dubbing for cartoon and animated characters and it looks like The Garfield Movie is a cakewalk for them. They deliver such a convincing performance that you subconsciously root for them to win in the last. The mute Odie is undoubtedly one of the biggest highlights on the film as well. He brings in such fun comic relief that you crave to see more of him. Personally, Ving Rhames as Otto the Bull and Nicholas Hoult as Garfield’s caretaker Jon also shined. Ving has some of the best lines in the film and they land so well. Hannah also delivers a memorable performance with Jinx. Director Mark Dindal along with the screenplay writers Paul A. Kaplan, Mark Torgove and David Reynolds stay more or less true to the essence of the comic, making it a treat for youngsters and parents who grew up reading Garfield. Extra applause to the writers for the Tom Cruise fanboying moments. The climax scene was hilarious and yet well executed by the visuals team. Bottom line: The Garfield Movie adds laughter to the otherwise hot summer. Walk in with the least expectations and you will end up having a ball."

    "article_content": "Written By : Yatamanyu Narain Edited By: Chirag Sehgal News18.com Last Updated: May 17, 2024, 11:07 IST New Delhi, India In a truly mesmerizing turn of events, the boundless universe of Mahishmati reveals new layers of complexity and intrigue as SS Rajamouli masterfully unveils a prequel brimming with heart-pounding action and captivating drama, pushing the boundaries of storytelling to remarkable heights. Baahubali: Crown Of Blood emerges as a profound and gripping prologue that meticulously weaves together the intricate destinies of Amarendra Baahubali, his formidable brother Bhallaladeva, and the shadows of Mahishmati’s dark and twisted history, shedding light on untold secrets and unresolved mysteries that resonate deeply with the soul of the saga. This 9-episode long animated series brought to life by Sharad Devarajan, Jeevan J. Kang, Shivangi Singh and others is more than just a visual treat. It unravels a fast-paced narrative, spearheaded by a new looming danger-Raktadeva, whose source of strength poses a grave threat to Sivagami Devi’s kingdom. Baahubali: Crown Of Blood is set several years before the events of Baahubali: The Beginning. The familiar voice of Katappa, juxtaposed with the iconic scenes from the Baahubali movies serves as a recap. It fluidly segues to the time when the fate of Mahishmati was rocked by a challenge quite unlike they had faced in the past. The grand court of Sivagami is stormed by some diplomats from the Garuda Kingdom, who levy accusations that their holy relic was stolen by Sivagami’s forces. They threaten her with the dire consequences of war if they don’t get back the same. As a counter, the ever-impulsive Bhallaldeva is ready to lock horns with them but Baahubali suspects something unusual about this conspiracy. To evade the possibility of bloodshed, his investigation leads him to the tribe of savages called Kaalkeya, who reside somewhere in the rocky terrains of the Kingdom. Rightfully so, the Garuda relic is brandished by their leader, as they rejoice and celebrate. Their merriment is interrupted by Baahubali who launches an offensive and bravely decimates them to the dust. Yet saving the day once again, Baahubali returns the relic to the envoys of Garuda Kingdom, to the dismay of his brother Bhallaldeva. Suspecting a bigger conspiracy behind this, we witness a cheeky banter between Baahubali and Katappa, as they brandish their wooden swords and practice on the training grounds. Just when Katappa humorously mocks Baahubali for avoiding a war, their persiflage is cut short by a panicking soldier who informs them about an attack outside the perimeter of Mahishmati. Upon their sombre arrival at the macabre tableau of lifeless elders hanging ominously from aged branches, the tranquillity of the moment is shattered by the sudden onslaught of a merciless horde, commanded by the formidable and fearsome figure of Raktadeva. His countenance etched with wrath and power, his sinewy form exuding a palpable aura of dread, he brandishes a uniquely sinister blade, the very embodiment of menace and lethal prowess. In a clash of titans, Katappa faces the brutal might of Raktadeva in a breathtaking ballet of steel and defiance. Despite his unwavering courage and expert skill, Katappa soon finds himself outmatched by the sheer ferocity and strength of his adversary, the resounding split of his sword a testament to Raktadeva’s dominance. Meanwhile, the valiant forces of Baahubali wage a desperate battle against the relentless tide of Raktadeva’s strategically superior army. As the thunderous advance of a futuristic tank, belching forth molten fury, heralds a new wave of peril, armed with a menacing rotor blade poised for carnage, Baahubali stands resolute against the tide of overwhelming power, his spirit undaunted amidst the chaos and cacophony of war’s cruel reality. Back in Mahishmati, a restless and impatient Sivagami awaits the return of her son, while Bhallaldeva has his fingers crossed, hoping for a fateful end to Baahubali’s reign. Katappa returns with only a handful of soldiers and a fallen cadaver, beckoning a mournful tide that he is unable to save Baahubali. Fuming with rage, Sivagami slaps and berates Katappa and orders him into a life of exile for not upholding his duty. Drowning with humiliation, Katappa travels beyond the kingdom of Mahishmati, resorting to alcohol and eventually crossing paths with the soldiers commanded by Raktadeva. While he joins them, there is more that what meets the eyes. The series peels off the mystery behind Raktadeva’s origin, his intention to wreak havoc upon Sivagami, Bhallaldeva and the flourishing realm of Mahishmati, his tragic and woeful past and the secret behind his destructive strength, through one episode at a time. Baahubali: Crown Of Blood shines through because of its realistic animation, catapulted by the team of SS Rajamouli and Sharad Devarajan. The landscape and characters from the universe of Baahubali don’t get compromised while being translated into animation, a rarity among the animated series produced in India. The pace of the story, with its twists and turns is punctuated by the numerous lores around the characters. In a masterstroke of storytelling, the creators delve into the murky depths of Bhallaldeva’s past, unravelling the tumultuous events that forged him into a vessel of seething resentment, consumed by an insatiable thirst for the throne of Mahishmati and a fit of venomous jealousy towards Baahubali. Simultaneously, they preserve the astonishing technological marvels of the Baahubali Universe, bestowing upon viewers a mesmerizing fusion of ancient grandeur and future innovation. The relentless cadence of Baahubali: Crown Of Blood’s narrative pulses with palpable excitement, offering a medley of enthralling elements sure to keep audiences perched on the edge of their seats. From heart-pounding combat sequences to soul-stirring interactions between Baahubali and the denizens of Mahishmati, each frame brims with a kaleidoscope of emotions and resonant dialogues that ensnare the imagination. The evolution of characters like Raktadeva and Koteshwar, coupled with an electrifying climax and a tantalizing cliffhanger, ensures that Baahubali: Crown Of Blood stands as a testament to the art of riveting storytelling, an invigorating spectacle that captivates and enthralls with each passing moment. However, the series is not devoid of flaws, primarily because of its simplistic treatment, allowing clichés to seep into the cracks, replete within its storyline. The anticipation in some scenes gets perforated by predictability, dimming its impact. Sharad Kelkar as the voice of Baahubali and Rajesh Khattar as the voice of Raktadeva evokes realism and authority. Samay Thakkar as Katappa, Manoj Pande as Bhallaldeva, Deepak Sinha as Bijjaldeva, Pramod Mathur as Koteshwar bring life to their respective characters. Adding to the grandeur of the universe of Mahishmati, Kaala Bhairava’s background score beautifully encompasses the beauty of this animated series. To sum it up, Baahubali: Crown Of Blood, despite its imperfections, opens a new portal into the rich world of Mahishmati, and the vast possibilities it holds in terms of its expansion. The groundbreaking animation style, at par with some of the most popular animes of Japan, ushers a new age of storytelling."

    "article_content": "Written By : Chirag Sehgal Edited By: Shrishti Negi News18.com Last Updated: May 24, 2024, 12:32 IST Mumbai, India When I walked into a theatre to watch Bhaiyya Ji, I was excited to see what Manoj Bajpayee was going to present in his 100th movie. However, as soon as the film ended, I was left wondering if it was worth the hype. Directed by Apoorv Singh Karki, Bhaiyya Ji revolves around a man who stands up for his family and seeks revenge for his younger brother’s murder. In the film, Manoj Bajpayee plays the role of Ram Charan aka Bhaiyya ji. He unleashes his inner gangster after his younger brother is burnt alive by a goon’s son in Delhi. Bhaiyya Ji’s narration and techniques follow the template of that of a Telugu or a Tamil movie. The setting of the film, its characters, the way they act and the way Bhaiyya ji is introduced – everything in the film is what you see in every other South movie. The film establishes Bhaiyya Ji as somebody who is committing crimes for a larger good, even if it requires killing 100s of men. The trait is often found in a Telugu or a Tamil movie. Just like any other South film, Bhaiyya Ji also uses a grieving mother whose only dream is to see her son taking revenge and killing their culprit. The film will also remind you of Yash’s KGF at several points. However, this does not mean that the director hasn’t done his job well. Even if you accuse him of aping a particular template, he has done it remarkably. Even though he struggles to make the film intriguing, the director makes sure that nobody gets bored while watching his film. The action of the film is top-notch. However, there are several loopholes in the movie. During the climax, Bhaiyya Ji fights his rivals at their residence. However, the setting keeps changing in almost every second scene. Manoj kills the first man in the Haveli’s hall but then enters a room which looks like it was closed and untouched for ages. Maybe, the makers should have paid more attention to the film’s setting. Another problem with the film is its low budget – which is very explicitly visible on screen. The film needed VFX for very few scenes. Guess what? It ruined that too. SPOILER ALERT! The scene where Manoj Bajpayee falls into a river after being shot is so terribly presented. No effort has been put into the VFX there. It not only takes away the seriousness of the scene but also makes it look animated. The film is also very predictable. There are scenes where you can easily guess what is going to happen next. For instance, when Bhaiyya Ji’s bride-to-be is attacked, you know exactly when and where he will enter the frame to save her. Even though the plot of Bhaiyya Ji is simple, it looks stretched. In 2 hours and 15 minutes, the film hardly features any exciting twists. Although Manoj Bajpayee plays his role with utmost sincerity, he does not really fit the character."

    "article_content": "Written By : Yatamanyu Narain Edited By: Chirag Sehgal News18.com Last Updated: May 28, 2024, 09:51 IST Mumbai, India TVF Panchayat is a poignant gift that keeps on giving. The familiar vicinage of Phulera, and its denizens, which has become an inseparable part of our pop culture is back again but with a more experimental direction in terms of storytelling. The third season presented by Chandan Kumar and Deepak Kumar Mishra has several ennobling moments that get etched in your conscience, and yet it lacks that punch that previous seasons had. Interestingly, this season pivots in a more dramatic direction, while retaining its immanent austerity. It is chaotic, overwhelming and even introduces the factor of unpredictability in several scenes. However, these new layers act as a deterrent to the soul of its ethos. Picking up from the cliffhangers of the Season 2 finale, the now-transferred Sachiv Ji (played by Jitendra Kumar) has relocated to Delhi for his CAT preparation. While smoking a cigarette with a fellow aspirant at a tapri , his pensive face suggests that he is still mentally thinking about Phulera and the new Panchayat secretary taking his place. Back in Phulera, Abhishek Tripathi’s replacement arrives at the Panchayat office on a bike but is dismayed to see the door latched with a lock. As it turns out, Brij Bhushan Yadav (played by Raghubir Yadav) and Vikas (played by Chandan Roy) are in cahoots to stop the new Panchayat secretary from joining. Taking stock of this situation, Bhushan aka Banrakas (played by Durgesh Kumar) attempts to influence the new secretary by instigating him against Brijbhushan and Chandan. Meanwhile, the new secretary who was appointed through the influence of disgruntled MLA Chandra Kishore Singh takes matters into his own hands when he starts to hammer down the Panchayat office lock. That’s when Prahlad Chand (played by Faisal Malik) steps in to save the day. Unfazed by the new secretary’s threats, he mounts a cot right outside the Panchayat office and politely warns the secretary of dire consequences if he steps inside. The standoff between Brij Bhushan, Vikas, Prahlad and the new secretary dissipated when a phone call informs them that the MLA is arrested in an animal cruelty case and the DM will ensure that the old secretary Abhishek resumes his post. As if waiting for this very news, Abhishek packs his bag and returns to Phulera. But what awaits him is more challenging. From navigating his attraction towards Rinki to tackling the dirty politics of the MLA, it becomes evident that Sachivji’s preparation will be marked by yet another interesting set of obstacles, one of which is also pertaining to the matter of palpable romance with Rinki. At its heart, the new season of Panchayat has several heartwarming instances to look forward to. Whether it’s Prahlad’s tumultuous journey of coping with the loss of his martyred son Rahul to a poor, an elderly woman’s determination to secure a bigger house for her son and his family, even at the cost of living outside in a shabby hut or orchestrating a fake family drama, the makers weave an emotionally mature story around the brewing discontent between Phulera West and Phulera East and the political tug-o-war between the factions of Banrakas, Binod and Madhav, who are backed by the devious and crafty MLA and the coterie of Brij Bhushan, Vikas, Prahlad, Sachiv Ji and Smt Manju Devi(played by Neena Gupta), who are vying for support from the entire village. We also witness the chemistry between Abhishek and Rinki develop gradually through the course of the 8-episode, and yet it is marked by a certain innocence and simplicity, a consistent trademark of the show. Even amid the turmoil, the duo are able to steal some time for one another, though interim but their camaraderie is winsome nevertheless. Season 3 of Panchayat takes off well in the first three episodes. The makers tenderly intertwine the predicaments of Jagmohan and his family with a grieving Prahlad. One particular scene between Jagmohan’s mother and Prahlad, where the two confide in each other will move you to tears. It’s raw, touching and soul-stirring. While the show has a handful of such moments, it gets criminally overshadowed by a dramatic track between the MLA and the village folks. Unlike the previous seasons, where we got to delve deep into the character’s dynamics and its relevance to the issues pertaining to the village, this season shifts its focus to an over-the-top narrative, which seems stretched and redundant after a while. Even the portrayal of the MLA is marred with stereotypical shades where the character is short-tempered, surrounded by lackeys wielding guns and other such traits borrowed from the usual tropes of Indian cinema. But even with its flaws, the new season will continue to tickle your funny bones, especially through characters like Binod and Madhav. Meanwhile, a meme-worthy character from the first season makes its comeback and brings some relief to the tense atmosphere of Phulera. His banter with Sachivji towards the end of the season is quite interesting, considering their beef over ‘Chakke Waali Kursi’. The witty dialogues being the backbone of the show, the cinematography and musical score also lend gravitas to the narrative. Anurag Saikia, through songs like Aasman Rootha and Khwaab, once again captures the ethos of Phulera and its people. There is also a melodious number crooned by Manoj Tiwari, acquainting the viewers to the rich repertoire of UP’s folk music. On the acting front, Faisal Malik as Prahlad steals the show with his portrayal of grief and how he overcomes the same. Even Chandan Roy as Vikas retains his on-screen humility as he juggles between his woes while being a supportive friend to Prahlad, Brij Bhushan and Abhishek. Jeetendra brings a tone of familiarity to his character which feels natural whenever he interacts with the people of the village. Both Raghubir Yadav and Neena Gupta compliment each other beautifully, even when they are bickering at the top of their voices. Abha Sharma as Amma Ji will make you fall in love with her performance. Sanvikaa as Rinki is charmingly brilliant. Pankaj Jha as MLA Chandra Kishore Singh gets into the skin of an egoistic and power-hungry politician. Ashok Pathak brings more facets to Vinod. Durgesh Kumar plays the scheming Bhushan aka Banrakas with ease. Sunita Rajwar as Kranti Devi comes across as convincing. Even the supporting actors with the smallest of roles made this season impactful with their presence. In essence, while the culmination of this season may have left some yearning for more and witnessed a subtle shift in its narrative essence, Panchayat 3 persevered in upholding its intrinsic charm—striking a delicate balance between humour, entertainment, and the uncharted depths of emotion waiting to be explored. As the expansive canvas of Phulera continues to expand with each passing season, the tantalizing prospect of uncharted territories beckons, promising a future brimming with untold tales waiting to unfold, leaving audiences eager to unravel the mysteries that lie ahead."

    "article_content": "Written By : Titas Chowdhury Edited By: Shrishti Negi News18.com Last Updated: May 31, 2024, 09:00 IST Mumbai, India Savi- A Bloody Housewife Movie Review: Stories of an unassuming woman suddenly recognising the power – physical and emotional – within her is a trope that almost always clicks. English Vinglish, Thappad, Tumhari Sulu and Darlings are a few examples. Abhinay Deo’s newest directorial outing, Savi: A Bloody Housewife, is the latest to join the league. Here, the protagonist starts off as a naïve, loving and non-violent homemaker and mother, who then treads on the path of vice to win justice. While it may be a desi adaptation of French film ‘Pour Elle’, it looks fresh, novel and works for the average Indian audience. The film revolves around Savitri Sachdev, fondly known as Savi by her loved ones, who lives in Liverpool with her husband Nakul and son Aditya. The Sachdev household is a regular Indian household that abounds in love and joy. One morning, however, their lives turn upside down when the police turn up at their door and arrest Nakul on the charges of allegedly murdering his boss Stefani Fowler. After being wrongly framed for the homicide, his appeal gets turned down and he gets sentenced to life under solitary confinement. Thus begins Savi’s journey to avenge her husband’s sentence. When she realises that the law isn’t on her side, she decides to take it upon herself to help him break free from prison. She soon finds herself playing with fire and in the process, comes across Joydeep Paul, an ex-convict who had escaped prison seven times and is now a writer. With a bit of help from him, an innocent housewife turns into a bloody one. At 2 hours 6 minutes, Savi: A Bloody Housewife makes for a thrilling and quick-paced ride. Abhinay wastes no time and nosedives into the crux of the narrative early on and hardly ever digresses from it through the inclusion of peripheral songs. While the film maybe less of a thriller and more of a suspense drama, he deserves brownie points for telling it earnestly and even with a dash of panache. So, if you’re looking for a volley of nail-biting moments and edge-of-the-seat sequences, you might be disappointed. Savi: A Bloody Housewife may lack the raw and unhinged edginess of Abhinay’s earlier works like Delhi Belly, 24 and Blackmail but it’s a great shot and he helps see Anil Kapoor and Divya Khossla, in particular, in a new light. Abhinay and writers Parveez Shaikh and Aseem Arora also deserve credit for portraying and creating the character of the female protagonist by rendering a sense of familiarity and simplicity. Savi is your regular, next-door homemaker. Her presence, in fact, is so unassertive that it would make her merge into the humdrum of everyday life. And what’s even more interesting is the fact that despite being a woman-led action thriller, the subject never becomes the object of male gaze. Not for once Savi emerges as a latex-clad sexy siren who needs to tantalise and titillate her prey with her sensual quotient. The makers also make sure that a homemaker doesn’t abruptly transition with a weapon-wielding action heroine beating up the bad people (or the lawmakers and good ones, in this film) and engaging in high-octane action sequences to prove her physical prowess. In fact, her feminine instincts become her biggest weapon. Even as she needs the nudge of a man (Joydeep) to bring out the beast within her, she never for once loses her empathy and compassion. One of the only things working against Savi: A Bloody Housewife is its stretched-out climax. A crisper climax much like the rest of the film would have definitely made it a better watch. Having said that, the film marks a revelation of sorts as it sees Divya hitting all the emotional notes right, a feat we haven’t had the opportunity of witnessing in the past. Here, she gets to play around with a meaty character with a dynamic graph and she does a great job. Her tears, fears and vulnerabilities are palpable and the substantial effort she puts in is visible. In a nutshell, she makes Savi an unusual blend of fragility and fearlessness. Anil Kapoor, who plays an ex-convict, also delivers a noteworthy performance. His Joydeep is borderline quirky, protective and unpredictable all at once. Some of his scenes and conversations with Divya’s Savi are fairly engaging. He acts as a perfect anchor to Savi and never leaves her hand. Even as she keeps questioning her own wrongdoings as a delinquent, he remains a safety net for her to fall back on. Harshvardhan Rane plays Savi’s husband and while he has a limited screen time, he makes sure that you take note of him. However, we eventually see him jumping in to join hands with Savi to break free from the clutches of injustice. For a film that is named after its female protagonist, it would have been nice to see the woman being at the foreground especially in the climax sequence. For years, we’ve been witnessing the glorious hero with a saviour complex protecting his woman. A contrasting change would have definitely set a precedent. But truth be told, every baby step counts. Savi: A Bloody Housewife will perhaps start a new chapter for Divya Khossla, the actor. Though predictable, it definitely deserves a watch for its fresh treatment and sincere attempt at being a clutter-breaker."

    "article_content": "Written By : Dishya Sharma Edited By: Shrishti Negi News18.com Last Updated: May 31, 2024, 10:08 IST Mumbai, India Mr & Mrs Mahi Movie Review: There is a scene in the first half of Janhvi Kapoor and Rajkummar Rao starrer ‘Mr & Mrs Mahi’, where Mahima (Janhvi) sneaks out of her room on her wedding night to watch a cricket match. This paritcular scene gave me hope that the film would give us a perspective about a woman’s love for a man’s game. However, it branched out into a different film altogether and left me disappointed. Directed by Sharan Sharma, Mr & Mrs Mahi revolves around a couple who loves cricket. Set in Jaipur, Mahendra aka Mahi (Rajkummar) and Mahima aka Mahi (Janhvi) met through an arrange marriage set up. While Mahima is an established doctor, Mahendra is a failed cricketer who is forced to work in his father’s sports goods store. An unhappy man, Mahendra falls in love with Mahima and they get married. After their wedding, Mahendra finds out that she loves cricket as much as he does. Mahima then urges him to return to the game. She encourages him to give playing for the state another shot. However, he fails in his second attempt too and his mentor asks him to rather consider a career in coaching. Hurt by his advice, Mahendra battles his inner turmoil. That’s when he sees Mahima’s cricketing skills and decides to coach her. She gives up her career as a doctor and follows Mahendra’s vision. After vigorous training, she cracks a spot in the state team and advances her way through it all. However, her growth puts Mahendra in the shadows. With no due given to him, he starts to seek fame through different mediums — Instagram Reels, radio, and even TV. But nothing works in his favour, leaving him frustrated. Eventually, he becomes bitter and ends up affecting Mahima’s game. Sports-themed movies usually come with a hint of hope throughout the film, making you root for the lead characters. Unfortunately, Mr & Mrs Mahi doesn’t let you root for either of the lead cast members. Written by Nikhil Mehrotra and Sharan Sharma, the film feels gloomy. Understandably exploring the insecurities and failure of Mahendra, the screenplay gives fleeting moments of happiness. As a result, most parts of the film make you feel dejected. The second half also felt similar to Abhimaan, the 1973 Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan (at the time Jaya Bhaduri) film. Although the set up and themes are different, the characterisation curve of Mahendra in the second half brought back memories of the Hrishikesh Mukherjee film. The script and screenplay also tells Mahima’s story from Mahendra’s perspective, thus limiting her to how he perceives her and not giving Janhvi enough room to sink her teeth into the character. The film also touches upon the emotion of ‘Abba nahi manege’. To much relief, those scenes landed well. What was shocking though about the screenplay is that it has limited cricket moments. While Mahima is seen hitting the balls into the stands to score sixes and fours, we don’t see her participate in the fielding or any other aspect of the game. The lack of such moments impacted the high that a sports film usually give. This also resulted in the film becoming linear. While the writing lacks the depth, Sharan, Janhvi and Rajkummar make up for it. The film is packaged well, with Sharan adding all the right elements of a trademark Dharma film making it a visually appealing film. He also falls back on the refreshing music album which works well in his favour. Sharan also benefits from his leading stars, who follow his vision seamlessly. Janhvi imbibes the role of a cricketer well. In the cricketing scenes, her training to ace the persona is evident. She also brings a breath of fresh air every time the film gets a little gloomy. Rajkummar as the dejected Mahendra steals the show. He carries the film on his shoulder in most parts. The scenes in which he embraces the grey side of his character proves he is a great fit for the role. A big shout out to Kumud Mishra for his performance as Mahendra’s father. Bottom Line: Mr & Mrs Mahi is not a bad film but it isn’t a great film either. Consider it was marketed as a sports-themed film, the film needed a few high moments of a sports drama to truly allow viewers to resonate with the characters and their struggles. I would recommend watching Mr & Mrs Mahi for the performances, music and cinematography."

    "article_content": "Written By : Dishya Sharma Edited By: Shrishti Negi News18.com Last Updated: June 06, 2024, 03:34 IST Mumbai, India Bad Boys Ride or Die Movie Review: Bad Boys, Bad Boys, Watcha Gonna Do? Well, they did all things entertaining! Returning for their fourth run, the ‘Bad Boys’ of Hollywood — Will Smith and Martin Lawrence reunite for a hilarious and action packed Bad Boys: Ride or Die. Sony Pictures’ Bad Boys: Ride or Die, aka Bad Boys 4, comes four years after the third Bad Boys film — Bad Boys for Life — released. While it not only kept the legacy of the franchise going, it also marked Will Smith’s first full-fledged release on the big screen since his Oscar slapgate featuring Chris Rock. (Note: Emancipation released in select cinemas on December 2, 2022, and streamed on Apple TV+ a week later.) As for Bad Boys 4, the film went on floors months after the slap incident. Given the franchise’s history, it was a given that the film will be entertaining, if not logical. But the post-slap effect was a tad bit evident in the film. Before we deep dive into the analysis, here’s a quick look at the Bad Boys Ride or Die plot: The film follows a simple storyline — Life has changed for Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence). The film starts with Mike getting married to Christine (Melanie Liburd). The wedding celebrations is filled with gags until Marcus suffers a heart attack. He explores the after life and even bumps into Conrad who tells him that he is not destined to die just yet. Returning from death, Marcus gives Mike and the audience a glimpse of what lays ahead of Mike. With his bare butt on display, Marcus informs Mike that he will be dragged into a complicated case. He advices him to remain strong on his stand and when the time will come to choose, he will eventually find a way to make the right decision. Once he returns to life, Marcus and Mike get dragged into an investigation of the corruption in the Miami PD. They are forced to get to the root of the corruption after the late Captain Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano) is accused of being involved with the Romanian mafia following his death. As the film progresses, Bad Boys: Ride or Die goes from being a bromance movie to exploring family dynamics. For those who love the action sequences shown in the franchise, don’t worry, the action is still at the forefront of it. Directors Adil and Bilall have delivered an entertaining film with the help of Smith and Lawrence. The director duo pack in the necessary doses of drama while keeping the high-octane action and fight sequence in the forefront. Not a single character goes without an epic action sequence. My personal favourites were the scenes featuring Reggie McDonald, Marcus’ son-in-law, played by Dennis Greene, and the epic climax fight scene. What stood out the most in the climax shot was that Adil and Bilall make you believe that you are in a video game and you have the controls. The climax plays out like one of a gameplay demo. The camera work by cinematographer Robrecht Heyvaert is impressive. The crisp writing by Chris Bremner and Will Beall adds a perfect cherry on this icing. While the production value was undoubtedly great, Bad Boys: Ride or Die suffered from uneven editing. The film was not patched in together well, especially in the first half, affecting the viewing experience. It felt unnecessarily rushed at a few points as well, leaving little room to truly grasp the plot. However, the performances and dialogues were great distractions. Martin Lawrence is the star of this film. The makers put him in the spotlight, and gave him the best moments and dialogues. He was like a box of firecrackers in the film, blowing up with epic one-liners at every given window. Will Smith, on the hand, doubled up as his support. While the film shed light on his relationship with his drug dealer son and even explored the impact of Captain Conrad’s death, it felt like he was purposely restrained from a lot of solo screentime in Bad Boys: Ride or Die. Even in the scenes featuring his son Armando Aretas, played by Jacob Scipio, the latter shone brighter than Smith. Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig and Paola Núñez held the screen even in their limited roles in the film. But hats off to the string of cameos and their placements in the film. Tiffany Haddish, who plays Tabitha in the film, had me bowing down to her. DJ Khaled reprising his role as Manny the Butcher left me in splits. I wish Bad Boys: Ride or Die was a bit longer to truly sink your teeth into the characters. Vanessa’s character could have been explored a little more while Eric Dane’s James McGrath did not give me the baddie vibes. He just felt like another supporting actor in the film. I also wanted to see a little more of Jacob Scipio, maybe a little more banter between his character Armando and the ‘Bad Boys’ Despite its shortcomings, Bad Boys: Ride or Die serves as a fun watch which is bound to leave you in splits and awe."

    "article_content": "Written By : Chirag Sehgal Edited By: Shrishti Negi News18.com Last Updated: June 07, 2024, 07:20 IST Mumbai, India Gullak is back with season four. Starring Vaibhav Raj Gupta, Geetanjali Kulkarni, Jameel Khan and Harsh Mayar in the lead, the show revolves around the Mishra family as they tackle their everyday middle-class problems and parenting dilemmas. It is now streaming on Sony LIV. At a time when there’s no dearth of thrillers, crime dramas and action-related films/shows on OTT, feel-good shows such as Gullak, Panchayat and Yeh Meri Family give your mood a much-needed boost. However, the latest season of Gullak turns out to be a disappointment in this case. The show suffers from a weak plot line and fails to take the legacy of the previous three seasons forward. It looks merely a compilation of a few scenes from a middle-class household. In each episode, it raises certain questions about parenting, expense-management and sibling relations but fails to explore these aspects. The show’s title i.e. Gullak is also not explained well in the new season. Even though Gullak is the narrator of the show, by the end of episode five, you wonder if the anchor is even needed in the first place. Gullak, the narrator, only talks about how a small family with limited income manages their daily expense in a rural household. It is worth noting that Gullak 4’s release comes two months after the release of Yeh Meri Family 3 and a week after Panchayat 3 premiered on Prime Video. These two series have set standards for any light-hearted shows revolving around middle-class families very, very high. And therefore, the wafer-thin plot of Gullak 4 leaves you disappointed. Sunita Rajwar, who has been getting rave reviews for her performance as Kranti Devi in Panchayat, is also a part of Gullak 4. But she’s given a very little screen time and a character which does not add anything to the plot. However, in this limited screen time too, she showcases her brilliant acting skills and wins hearts. Other actors like Vaibhav Raj Gupta, Geetanjali Kulkarni and Jameel Khan have also played their parts with utmost sincerity. The amount of efforts they have put in to bring life to their respective characters is visible on screen. However, their earnest performances are the only saving grace of this otherwise boring show."

    "article_content": "Written By : Aditi Giri Edited By: Shreyanka Mazumdar News18.com Last Updated: June 07, 2024, 10:28 IST Mumbai, India Munjya Review: Some films ride high on emotions, and then some stories ride high on Indian culture and Hindu mythology. Maddock Films is surely managing to balance both kinds with their authenticity. The production house is creating its supernatural universe comprising horror-comedy films that are earthy and rooted in Indian folklore. These films are no less than bedtime stories coming alive. They make you believe in the magic and mystery of India’s rich mythological heritage, that blur the lines between reality and fantasy. The film series kicked off in 2018 with the release of Stree, starring Rajkumar Rao and Shraddha Kapoor. It was then followed by Roohi in 2021, starring Janhvi Kapoor and Rajkummar Rao. The following year, 2022, Bhediya was released with Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon, where the plot draws inspiration from the Arunachal Pradesh legend of the Yapum. Their next movie, Munjya, starring Abhay Verma, Sharvari Wagh, and Mona Singh, perfectly blends the eerie essence of horror with the rich folklore of the Konkan region. The movie draws inspiration from a spirit from the Brahmin community of Konkan, known as Brahma Rakshas. In the film, a dark and twisted legend comes to life as we delve into the haunting past of Bittu’s (Abhay Verma) family. Years before he was born, his great uncle, once a respected member of the Brahmin community in Konkan, transformed into a fearsome Brahma Rakshas, as he died within 10 days of his mundan ceremony. This was also triggered by his sinister desire to kill his sister, Abhay’s grandmother (Suhas Joshi), to clear his path to marry his lover, Munni, a woman seven times his age. Adding to the complexity of this tale, Abhay’s grandmother and Munni were once the closest of friends. Bittu lives with his mom (Mona Singh) and his grandmother in Pune, far from their ancestral home in Chetukwadi, a small village in the Konkan region with a beautiful coastline. Together with his mom, he runs a salon, and they lead a happy, simple life. Things go smoothly for them until one day, they receive an invitation from their village to attend the engagement ceremony of Bittu’s cousin. Bittu’s mom, who’s reluctant and apprehensive to meet eye-to-eye with her brother-in-law, finds herself in a situation where she is bound to go with her son. Her mother-in-law also accompanies her. As they reach Chetukwadi, they don’t really receive a warm welcome. Mona’s brother-in-law despises her, ever since his brother passed away. Amidst the heated family feud, Bittu, overwhelmed by the tension, flees their home and heads towards the coastline, once walked by his great uncle towards the banyan tree where his tragic demise occurred. There, Bittu encounters the Munjya – the spirit transformed by his great uncle’s restless soul. After a tragic incident, while Bittu gets rescued from that spot, he soon realises that the demon had hit him and marked his territory at his back. The demon who gets behind him threatens him to fulfil his one wish – to find his lover Munni and get them married. Abhay Verma is a natural. He steps into the shoes of his character, Bittu, with a lot of conviction. In the film, he is scared and anxious with an honesty that seems so palpable that you’d empathise with him. His childlike eyes and smile light up every frame. He brings in the right sense of charm, sense and sensitivity with his on-screen persona. He carries the entire film on his shoulders effortlessly. Another amazing aspect, is Abhay’s CGI co-star, Munjya. The character is well-made. The animation is pitch-perfect for the monstrous personality he owns. Sharvari Wagh delivers her career-best. Despite a short screen time, her commendable acting skills bring in the required depth. She portrays Bella, a character that brings in a much-needed twist for the film. I would have wanted to see more of her in the film given her potential. It’s her second big film, and she’s slowly showing her cards. Mona Singh, as always, despite the short screen time, is real and effortless in her scenes. She has the potential to take risks and pick roles that are uncomfortable to watch and unconventional to portray. She does a splendid job on her part and has even outdone herself in some scenes. The movie is balanced and well-paced. The 2-hour 18-minute run-time wouldn’t dread you, as the plot keeps you on the edge. The jump scares, the screams, the chase – everything feels nail-biting. The scenes are entertaining as well as eerily scary. However, one thing that did not sit right with me was the background score. In parts, the background music, attempting to sound haunting, ended up as mere noise. All in all, Munjya beautifully draws inspiration by blending elements of horror and cultural depth to weave a story that is both enthralling and deeply rooted in Indian mythology. The movie delivers a good cinematic experience owing to its good writing and the gripping folklore. It is a clean entertainer. It has family-friendly written all over it and has all the elements of a typical commercial horror comedy. This is a must-watch for anyone interested in folklore and horror storytelling. And yes, you do not want to miss the post-credit scene. A good watch!"

    "article_content": "Written By : Nishad Thaivalappil Edited By: Shrishti Negi News18.com Last Updated: June 13, 2024, 14:58 IST Mumbai, India Chandu Champion Movie Review: Move over Vicky Kaushal’s “How’s the Josh?”, Kartik Aaryan’s dialogue “Chandu nahi, Champion hai main” from Kabir Khan’s latest directorial ‘Chandu Champion’ is here to win your hearts and fill you with myriads of emotions. Through this sports biopic, Kartik and Kabir have brought a heartwarming tale of Murlikant Petkar’s life — the struggles and the milestones that he achieved in his career – to the big screen. Produced by Nadiadwala Grandsons, the film takes you back to the 1970s when Petkar was fighting all odds to become an Olympic champion. A young Murli dreams of securing a gold medal for India at the Olympics. Thanks to legendary wrestler Dara Singh, Murli is drawn to wrestling since childhood and decides to start training in his village at a very young age. Through his adolescence, he manages to get fit and learn the moves and tricks of the sport by just watching others wrestle in the arena. A local competition in the village sees Murli take the centre stage without any formal training and manage to defeat his opponent, who also happens to be a newbie, but with formal training in the sport. This is where his journey begins. He is forced to run away after the fight and that’s where he catches the train that drops him one station closer to his dream land. The first half comprises his journey from a young athlete to a mature sportsperson and also as a soldier in the Indian Army. One might even draw similarities to that of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, which depicts Milkha Singh’s (played by Farhan Akhtar) life inside a military training camp in Secunderabad. A strict and loud instructor, young aspiring soldiers and how they stay, enjoy, eat and train together is what makes the majority of the first half. Here, at the training center, Murli shifts from being a wrestler to a boxer, and becomes a pro in the sport thanks to Tiger Ali, played by Vijay Raaz. The training and transformation of Murli from a wrestler to a professional boxer will surely remind you of Eye Of The Tiger from Sylvester Stallone’s Rocky series. But don’t let your comparisons take the front seat, yet! The second half showcases different emotional phases and struggles of Murli who gets paralysed from knee down after being hit by nine bullets during the 1971 Indo-Pak war. The journey from being a person, ready to give up on life to becoming a Paralympic gold medalist, Murli’s story makes the second half look fresh and takes the film a notch higher. Undoubtedly, Kartik has delivered his career-best performance that aptly conveys his character’s inner turbulence, much of it derived from Murli’s childhood bullying and people’s disbelief in his potential. Moreover, it’s the emotional yet rousing finale that will have audiences cheering for Kartik, the star. Vijay Raaz, Rajpal Yadav and Bhuvan Arora have also done excellent job and played their parts with utmost conviction. Overall, Chandu Champion, skilfully directed by Kabir Khan, proves irresistible with its powerful feel-good story."

    "article_content": "Written By : Dishya Sharma Edited By: Shrishti Negi News18.com Last Updated: June 14, 2024, 04:19 IST Mumbai, India Inside Out 2 Movie Review: In the climax scene of Disney-Pixar’s Inside Out 2, there comes a moment when director Kelsey Mann shows anxiety at its peak. Taking full control of the mind, the scene truly displayed how it feels when an anxiety attack takes place. It is in that moment I realised what an important film Mann, Maya Hawke, Amy Poehler and the whole team of Inside Out 2 have set out to deliver. Releasing 10 years after the prequel, Inside Out 2 has taken a time jump. This time, fans of the franchise are reunited with a teenage Riley (Kensington Tallman), a star in class and in her hockey team. She is invited to train with an esteemed high school hockey coach. She will train alongside Valentina “Val” Ortiz (Lilimar), a popular high school hockey player. Unfortunately for her, she hit puberty on the first day of her camp. This causes havoc in her mind. The headquarter, which so far housed only Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Tony Hale) and Disgust (Liza Lapira), suddenly has more emotions coming in. These include Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser). The new emotions try to take charge and even suppress Riley’s previous emotions, forcing her to change. However, in the process, Riley loses her real self and even develops an anxiety problem. Inside Out 2 goes on to show how these emotions learn to live together. The second Inside Out film is definitely more mature, well-thought and well-written than the first one. With the additions of the new emotions, director Kelsey Mann choses to deconstruct each new emotion, especially anxiety, instead of complicating Riley’s mind. This is a great approach towards shedding light on mental health for the audiences who are still learning about mental health issues, especially teenagers and young adults. There is no denying that Maya Hawke’s anxiety is the star of the show. Given the complexity of anxiety, Mann has let it take charge and truly spread its wings — showing the positive and negative side of the emotion. Kudos to the screenplay writers Meg LeFauve and Dave Holstein for not hating upon the emotion but making people empathise and normalise it. Up until now, in the animation world, I felt that only Puss in Boots: The Last Wish came the closest to help me describe what anxiety looks like. However, after watching Inside Out 2, I feel that I can explain to people what it feels like internally. The scenes featuring the emotion showed that the film is well-researched and delicately crafted. Another character which was well-presented was Embarrassment. The character leaves a lasting impact and holds a great screen presence despite the emotion having just one line in the film. His bond with sadness leaves a grin on your face. I really wish the film explored that dynamics a tad more. Envy was another character that lit up the screen every time she took the centre stage. Ayo Edebiri was wonderful behind the mic on this one. As for the emotions from the first film, I loved that Kelsey Mann gave Joy and Anger a new arc. There are scenes in which Joy breaks down and Anger takes charge to hype her. As much as it sounds strange, it played out well on the screen, showing that even these emotions have matured with Riley. Amy as Joy is always fun to hear. But this time, she was also given more scope than to just sound happy in the film and she embraced it with open arms. Her dynamics with Maya Hawke — animated and vocal — were the highlights of the film. But given that the attention was mostly on Joy and Anxiety, the supporting characters feel like they are getting lost in the narration, despite being present in the scene. The lack of story for them pops up in a few places and it is hard to miss. Having said that, Pixar-Disney never fail when it comes to visuals. Inside Out 2 is a colourful film which is pleasing to the eyes. To top it off, the detailing in the vaults of the mind, the imagination space and the ‘back of the mind’ is impressive. Inside Out 2 is a thought-provoking and emotional film that is bound to leave you in tears and makes you introspect long after the film is over."

    "article_content": "Written By : Dishya Sharma Edited By: Shrishti Negi News18.com Last Updated: June 15, 2024, 10:47 IST Mumbai, India House of the Dragon Season 2 Episode 1 Review: It has been two years since Game of Thrones fans watched the epic finale of House of the Dragon season 1. The last time we met the Targaryens, they were in the King’s Landing with a war breaking out within the family. Viserys dies and the Hightowers makes their first move towards the throne. The episode branches out into true-blue Game of Thrones moments, with a war breaking out and power politics at play and a few shocking deaths, including the death of Rhaenyra’s son Luke. The new season picks up pieces of the first one. On one hand, the Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) and Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) are plotting towards taking down the rival Targaryen family. On the other hand, Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) is mourning her son’s death. With no word from the Queen, Prince Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith) takes it upon himself to build an army to avenge Luke’s death. The first episode of the House of the Dragon season 2 takes things slow, giving only a tease of what could be a bloody season. It teases a few new allies while also hinting that the feud between the Targaryens could impact the Hightowers. The writing will feel slow, especially since it is laying out the ground work for the new season. Stick through it because it is going to help you understand how the new season will branch out. It follows a similar narrative style as the first season so it is not going to be difficult to follow. Despite the slow narrative, Emma D’Arcy, Olivia Cooke, and Matt Smith’s performances keep you hooked. Emma moves you with her powerful performance of a grieving mother. Matt, as always, holds the screen and your attention every time he is in the scene. Olivia has the most screen time in the first episode and she’s given a range of scenes that helps her display her acting chops. A special shout out to the opening credits. The creative opening credits scene lingers around in the mind much after the episode ends, even prompting you to revisit it to decode the details in it. Having watched only one episode of the House of the Dragon season 2, it is difficult to say if the new season will live up to the expectations. So far, it seems to feature similar elements as the first season, However, the first episode sets an interesting tone of grim, war and new additions which is hinting that the House of the Dragon wants to break free from the shadows of Game of Thrones and carve a niche of its own. House of the Dragon season 2 is set to premiere on June 16 (June 17, IST). In India, the episodes will drop weekly on Jio Cinema. Although the show is in English, Indian audiences can watch it in Hindi, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Kannada and Bengali as well."

The show marks the return of Jeetu Bhaiya aka Jitendra Kumar with other cast members including Mayur More, Ranjan Raj, Alam Khan, Ahsaas Channa, Revathi Pillai, and Urvi Singh. Kota Factory 3 is now streaming on Netflix. Just like the previous season, Kota Factory 3 is very relatable. If you have stayed out of your house in a hostel or a PG for academic purposes, you’ll connect with it and find it nostalgic. It shows how children find families and friends outside the home when they are longing for love and care. The stories of three friends – Viabhav (Mayur More), Meena (Ranjan Raj) and Uday (Alam Khan) depicted in Kota Factory 3 are very different yet important and should be looked at from various perspectives. Vaibhav is a child every parent desires. He is obedient, disciplined, and knows what he wants in life. Yes, there are times when he gets insecure and doubts his capabilities but that does not stop him from working hard. He knows how he can achieve his dreams. Even though destiny has other plans for him (Watch the show to know what). Mayur has played this part well. He looks natural in his act. He flawlessly delivers different shades, including pride, fear, insecurity, love, friendship, and care. He makes you completely engrossed with his character. You smile when he smiles and when he fails, you are left heartbroken. Meena, played by Ranjan Raj, is that one guy from your college, who is extremely innocent, sweet, and humble. He won’t call you by your name but will use ‘Ji’ with it. Even though he faces financial struggles at home, he works hard to pay his fees and knows how can he support his family. In a world where it is often said, ‘ Bacche ko bahar jaake hawa lag gaye ‘, Meena is an example of somebody who does not let his freedom overpower his motive of clearing IIT. Pat on Ranjan Raj’s back for playing this part with utmost ease and perfection. On the other hand, Uday is the perfect example of somebody’s ‘jisko hawa lag gayi’. Alam Khan returns as Uday in Kota Factory season 3 and adds an element of humour to the show. He is carefree (can read it as careless also) and believes in living in the present rather than worrying about the future. (SPOILER ALERT) Even when he fails to clear the IIT exam, he accepts it with a smile and adds that he isn’t shocked or disappointed. However, his character also has a hidden layer of care and love emotions. We get to see this when his girlfriend decides to go home for some time and when Meena is in a financial crisis. Overall, Uday is fun to watch. Alam adds energy to the scenes and improves the graph of the show. However, there is a problem with Kota Factory 3. Why are there only men and boys all around? Vaibhav, Meena, and Uday’s girlfriends – Revathi Pillai, Urvi Singh, and Ahsaas Channa aren’t given much screenspace in the show. They have been used as supporting actors with no opportunity to show their talent and acting skills. Several reports have suggested that the city has many young girls and women coming down to prepare for the IIT entrance exams. However, the makers of Kota Factory ignore this aspect. One should ask why has this been done by the makers. One may not agree but it shows how deeply rooted patriarchy is in our society. When it comes to engineering or taking admission to IIT, we all know how difficult it might get for girls since a large number of families, even today, believe the option isn’t best suited for them. This is why the makers should have used their show to present equality, to show that a career isn’t gender specific. Why is it that Ahsaas’s character, who is preparing for the NEET exam, has not been given any relevance? Time to think. Not only this, but Tillotama Shome also joined Kota Factory 3 as a teacher in Jeetu Bhaiya’s coaching centre. Despite the brilliant actor that she is, she has also not been given much relevance. Her character arc had a lot of scope to grow but the makers have developed it properly. Even though it is a good move by the makers to show at least one female professor in the coaching centre, they fail to give her the screen time she deserves. Jitendra Kumar returns as Jeetu Bhaiya but gets a little lost in season three of Kota Factory. It is primarily because a lot is going on in his life. As described in the previous season, Jeetu is not just a faculty member but somebody who solves all kinds of problems, ‘academic, non-academic, personal, financial or romantic’. However, this time we see him facing several battles because of the same. Jeetu Bhaiya starts to take his students’ problems as his own and blames himself when something goes wrong. This ends up impacting his mental health and he begins to face anger issues. He then begins to wonder who is better – Jeetu Bhaiya or Jeetu Sir. The constant tussle in his head makes you sympathise for him but also makes you wonder if the Jeetu Bhaiya of the previous Kota Factory seasons is lost. His story ends in an unexpected way which further leaves you confused. Kota Factory season 3 is a package of emotions. It engages you with the stories of its characters and keeps you engrossed till the end. However, the fifth and the last episode of the show is disappointing. It rushes everything to conclude the show and makes you question why the makers have ended the show in haste. The black and white theme of Kota Factory should also be questioned now. In the previous two seasons, it depicted the sad, disconnected, and depressed lives of the students in Kota. But in season three, it does not make any sense. You just get used to watching it with its monochrome theme. It does not leave behind a meaningful and impactful message. Even when the results were out and students were celebrating, its monochrome theme did not fit well. Maybe it was time for the makers to change it."

    "article_content": "Written By : Shreyanka Mazumdar News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 22:36 IST Mumbai, India Bad cop review : In a good thriller, the protagonist, often an ordinary person thrown into extraordinary circumstances, should be relatable yet resourceful – someone you root for as they wade through a labyrinth of suspense. Bad Cop, directed by Aditya Datt, tries to do just that and almost succeeds. Starring Gulshan Devaiah in a double role as Karan and Arjun, the series interweaves the lives of identical twins with polar opposite personalities – one a fierce cop, the other a petty thief – and, at some point, you find yourself rooting for both. The plot – a fun twist on the age-old chor-police drama with a side of Judwaa – kicks off with the murder of a journalist, Anand Mishra in Pune, and a tip-off, setting off a chain of events that exposes a sprawling ivory smuggling racket. Karan, the dedicated cop, is on a mission to bring down the formidable villain Kazbe, portrayed by the inimitable Anurag Kashyap. The series ably blends Karan’s professional pursuit with his personal struggles, particularly his relationship with his wife Devika, played by Harleen Sethi, with whom he’s on the verge of a divorce. Gulshan Devaiah, in top form, is the series’ powerhouse, effortlessly portraying both Karan and Arjun. His performance is nothing short of riveting – from the high-octane fight scenes and high-stakes chases to the emotionally charged arguments and moments of self-doubt. Gulshan’s ability to convey complex emotions through subtle body language and expressive eyes keeps the audience glued to the screen. Harleen Sethi shines as Devika, balancing the roles of a righteous cop and a wife struggling to save her marriage for the sake of their daughter. The chemistry between Gulshan and Harleen is undeniable. It’s a romance you can’t help but cheer for, even though deep down you know it’s doomed. Saurabh Sachdeva, coming off his recent success in Animal, brings gravitas to his role as ACP Aarif Khan, driven by a personal vendetta to find his friend’s murderer. Anurag Kashyap as Kazbe is a revelation. Kazbe gets to mouth the meatiest punchlines and performs brutal actions, and Anurag’s ability to switch between calm menace and explosive violence keeps viewers hooked and horrified in equal measure. The letdown, however, is Kazbe’s aides. They are willing to kill people on command but oscillate between being wimps and acting completely unhinged. Now, to what doesn’t work for the series. Most of the side characters feel like they’ve been lifted from other shows or movies, playing the same old roles. A sense of déjà vu persists throughout the 6 episodes. Businessmen with a taste for debauchery? Check. Corrupt politicians? Check. Goons comically pleading with their criminal bosses for second chances at murder? Check. The plot is woven in 30-minute episodes, but the twists, fail to keep you guessing. But, beyond all that, Bad Cop also tackles the serious issue of hunting and smuggling. The series doesn’t shy away from depicting the grim realities of wildlife crime, making a statement on the devastating impact of these illegal activities. The series is a well-put-together thriller that combines breakneck pacing and good performances. It’s a good watch if you like action-packed dramas."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Dishya Sharma News18.com Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 10:05 IST Mumbai, India Ishq Vishk Rebound Movie Review: Let’s begin this review with a confession. Ishq Vishk Rebound is not made for me. I am not its target audience, but it might be a treat for Rohit Saraf fans! However, as a person who enjoys watching romcoms and has loved the OG Ishq Vishk, the new film seems like that strange relationship which has far more red flags than green ones. While it has the troupes of a fun rom-com with all the ‘Ishq Vishk’, it fell short on the ‘pyaar-vyaar’. For the unversed, Ishq Vishk Rebound is not a sequel to Ishq Vishk that starred Shahid Kapoor, Amrita Rao and Shenaz Treasury. It is a fresh story about three Gen Z friends — Sahir (Jibraan Khan), Sanya (Pashmina Roshan) and Raghav (Rohit Saraf) — who have grown up together. At a certain point in their lives, Sahir and Sanya start dating while Raghav is their permanent third wheel. Not only is he a part of their dates but is also involved in their fights. He is also a support to both the characters who tackle their share of daddy issues. But life gets complicated when Rohit stars dating Riya (Naila Grrewal). A environmentalist, Riya doesn’t get off on a good note with Sanya, who behaves like a pampered brat with her. As a result, Raghav decides to date her in secret. Even as they dated, Raghav prioritised his friendship with Sanya over her. This results in Raghav and Riya’s breakup. On the other hand, Sanya and Sahir break up because he gets admitted to Army school and Riya, despite being aware of his life choices, behave immaturely. With Sahir off to his military school, Raghav is tasked to take care of Sanya. However, one thing leads to another and the friends end up kissing each other. Their equation changes and this unfolds layers of complications. Will Raghav end up with Sanya or is it just another rebound that will come to end? You will have to watch the film to find that out. But fair warning, much like most situationships, Ishq Vishk Rebound is messy too. Writing-wise, the scenarios and flaky Ishq-Vishk they share with their ‘SO’ are portrayed well. However, it has not translated properly to the screen. It feels like the movie was a part of some Instagram series that were patched together. (Possible spoiler ahead): There is a scene in the first half where Raghav gets lost and a worried Sanya tries to hunt him down. When she finally finds him, she gets emotional. Thanks to the Instagram-style editing, my brain immediately thought that the song ‘Sajni Re’ from Laapataa Ladies would start playing in the background. (Thank you, Kiran Rao and Instagram algorithm). The biggest issue I faced with this film is the headache-inducing camera work. The angles are random and their experimental shots are not pleasing to the eyes. There is a scene in which Raghav is avoiding Riya’s calls. The camera pans from one situation to another but instead of cutting into scenes, it spins around the frame. The shot is long enough to make your head spin. The disappointing camera work bogs down the film’s viewing experience. But fortunately, the actors manage to hold our hands until the end. Ishq Vishk Rebound is out and out Rohit Saraf’s film. He is the narrator of the film. His character, Raghav, often breaks the fourth wall to talk to the audience and share his thoughts. The approach is heavily inspired from Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Emmy-award winning show Fleabag. In India, Kader Khan had done it in the 1980s with Ghar Ho Toh Aisa. Given that the approach has not been used by movies in relatively recent years, audiences will find Rohit breaking the fourth wall refreshing. At one point, he also appeared to be enjoying the unique style of storytelling. Pashmina, on the other hand, delivered an uneven performance. While she had impressive moments with her on-screen mother, played by Supriya Pilgaonkar, her scenes with the boys were rocky in the first half. As she approached the second half, Pashmina appeared a lot more comfortable with the camera and her co-stars. As for Jibraan Khan and Naila Grrewal, they deserved bigger roles and scenes. Jibraan brought a fun and charming personality on screen but his role was limited to the catalyst of the main love story of the film. Given that it is a complicated love triangle, Jibraan should have had a few more scenes, especially with Rohit to showcase their bond. Naila’s role in the film felt more like an extended cameo. Bottom line: Ishq Vishk Rebound is for today’s young adults. The youngsters will enjoy the film but those seeking a hint of Ishq Vishk nostalgia will be in for a heartbreak."

    "article_content": "Written By : Titas Chowdhury News18.com Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 15:17 IST Mumbai, India Hamare Baarah Movie Review: Back in 2011, a Pakistani film titled Bol created quite a buzz for its bold subject. It marked the film debuts of Atif Aslam and Mahira Khan and dealt with themes such as consent, toxic patriarchy and misogyny with its bottom line being – why is giving birth without any family planning not a sin? Annu Kapoor starrer Hamare Baarah which released today will constantly make you think about Bol. The Hindi film questions the orthodox and radical beliefs and ideologies of Islam and how oppression of all kinds is sometimes falsely glorified in the name of treading the path of divinity and virtue. Hamare Baarah is set in Lucknow’s Aminabad and opens with a sequence that sees a woman named Alfia moving the Lucknow High Court to file a case so to as to give her stepmother the right to abort. Her case gets easily dismissed by many with a lawyer telling her, ‘Bhaang kha ke aayi ho kya?’ It is then that she meets a woman lawyer who’s introduced as someone who ‘paise ke liye nahi, haq ke liye ladti hai’ and is known for fighting many polygamy cases. Back home, Alfia has ten other siblings. Her father, Mansoor Ali Khan Sanjeri is an orthodox and staunch Muslim, who only believes in the madrasa style of education. According to him, western schooling drives youngsters towards drugs, alcohol and debauchery. He expects his children – both sons and daughters – to not digress from the teachings of Allah and if that requires him to pin down their wings, so be it. His first wife Salma had passed away after giving multiple births and his second wife Rukhsar is about to meet a similar fate. She gets pregnant with Mansoor’s twelfth child, a news that brings him immense joy and pride but which can prove fatal to Rukhsar’s life as frequent pregnancies have weakened her uterus. However, the topic of abortion riles him up as he believes it’s a form of rejecting Allah’s gift and blessing. And this drives Alfia to fight for her stepmother, which obviously doesn’t sit well with Mansoor. Hamare Baarah makes for a tough watch. It’s packed with several uncomfortable moments. Case in point: Mansoor thrashing his daughter Zareen when he comes to know that she has been selected in the top 30 of a musical reality show and has to travel to Mumbai to fulfill her dreams. Another distressful sequence is the one where Rukhsar falls to Mansoor’s feet at a hospital and begs him to not divorce her through the utterance of triple talaq. It’s the conditioning and fear of patriarchy that doesn’t let the women in the household raise their voices against his wrongdoings with Alfia being the only exception. Hamare Baarah grapples with a controversial, critical and pertinent issue. It strives to question and critique social and religious conditioning but its shoddy treatment and execution comes in the way. Here, the makers believe that theatrics and histrionics are the only way to portray and convey a grave story that needs telling. At 2 hours 28 minutes, the film seems like a long meandering train ride that keeps stopping at every station with no certainty on when it will reach its final destination. Song sequences pop up every now and then. In fact, the first half of the film boasts of four such sequences. As for the second half, the courtroom scenes appear too long-drawn and repetitive. Credit, however, goes to writer Rajan Agarwal who tactfully manages to pen a script that doesn’t attack Islam and Quranic teachings but cast the spotlight on how the community is misrepresented and misinterpreted by those who practice it as well as outsiders. While the story emphasises on women empowerment, it doesn’t throw men under the negative light in the process. So, on one hand, there’s Mansoor and Shahnawaz, his eldest son, who are misogynists and tyrants blinded by religious fanaticism. On the other hand, the film has Shoaib, Mansoor’s second son, and Danish, a journalist, who are feminists and are unafraid to voice their exasperation against toxic traditionalism. Annu Kapoor ably carries Hamare Baarah on his shoulders. You’ll end up hating his Mansoor and wishing for his redemption. However, he takes the dramatic quotient many notches high in most of the scenes and it is this loudness that diminishes what the film truly set out to achieve. Paritosh Tripathi and Rahul Bagga are impressive. Aditi Bhatpahri as Alfia is a revelation. She holds her own among the ensemble cast. She proves her mettle in the emotionally heavier scenes and you’ll root for her against all odds. Parth Samthaan as Danish brings about some much-needed calm to this high-octane narrative and he emerges as the wind beneath Alfia’s wings. Ashwini Kalsekar and Manoj Joshi as lawyers are also top-notch. The rest of the cast members, especially Ankita Dwivedi, deserve applause for their impact performances. Ankita’s vulnerability and helplessness will surely tug at your heartstrings. But all said and done, Hamare Baarah even with its heart and intent in the right place doesn’t leave an impact as strong as the nuanced and sensitively told story of Bol."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Aditi Giri Edited By: Shrishti Negi News18.com Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 23:27 IST Mumbai, India Maharaj Movie Review: Time and again, Indian cinema has given us stories from the pages of history textbooks or allowed us to travel back in time to witness landmark cases. And director Siddharth P. Malhotra’s latest Netflix film, Maharaj, is one such story. The film is an honest attempt to portray a legal battle, inspired by the 1862 Maharaj Libel Case, which is also called ‘the greatest trial of modern times since the trial of Warren Hastings’. The legal battle takes place between a journalist and a famous godman, where the latter gets embroiled in a sexual assault scandal, with onlookers intently watching every move of the judges. The case garnered widespread attention and scrutiny, setting the stage for what many consider to be one of the most significant legal battles of all time. This trial ran in the Bombay High Court in 1862. Junaid Khan, son of Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan, makes his debut with this historical drama, playing the role of journalist and social reformer Karsandas Mulji. Jaideep Ahlawat plays the role of a godman, Jadunathji Brijratanji Maharaj, one of the heads of the Vallabhacharya sect. Filmmaker Siddharth P. Malhotra has certainly brought out the best performances from them. His direction is commendable. The film is well-researched. He skillfully captures the essence of the period, creating a visually stunning film that immerses the audience in the 18th and 19th centuries. The cinematography enhances the narrative, with every frame being vibrant and reflecting the era’s authenticity. The film’s pacing is well-maintained, ensuring the story flows smoothly without any lulls. The editing is sharp, keeping the audience engaged throughout the film. Junaid steps into the shoes of Karsandas Mulji with much-needed conviction. His dialogue delivery is on point, and he brings in the right sense of charm, wit, and sensitivity. As the plot thickens, Khan’s performance remains compelling, drawing the audience deeper into the historical narrative. There’s a lot of honesty and hard work, and that’s evident in his performance. He surely makes a promising debut. Jaideep Ahlawat never ceases to surprise. You’d be intimated by him. He delivers his part with so much intensity and authenticity. He is simply terrific, as he does not let a single false note creep into his character. He brings in the fear, the menace, and the raw emotion that the role demands. Shalini Pandey, on the other hand, portrays her part with innocence. She finds the perfect balance between her emotions and is an absolute delight to watch. She plays Junaid’s love interest, and her chemistry with him is palpable. Sharvari Wagh lights up every frame with poise. She makes an impactful extended cameo. Her commendable acting skills and ability to mold her character effortlessly speak volumes about her dedication to the craft. All the actors have played their parts exceptionally well, avoiding any trace of caricature. They bring authenticity to their roles, each contributing significantly to the storyline’s progression. Their performances are nuanced and compelling, ensuring that every character feels real and essential to the narrative. Maharaj feels incredibly real and avoids being too extreme for viewers. The necessary cinematic liberties enhance the storytelling without detracting from its authenticity. The narrative is strong and well-balanced. Hence, the plot leaves no room for distraction, keeping the audience hooked until the very end. All in all, if you are into history and curiosity runs inside your veins, Junaid Khan’s Maharaj can entertain as well as educate you about one of the landmark cases ever fought in history."

We at Network18 Media & Investments Limited and its Group Companies have observed a trend wherein certain fraudster individuals and companies have been approaching innocent job seekers and promising them lucrative job offers in our group companies. Once a potential applicant is taken into confidence, these fraudsters ask them to make payments to a designated bank account or through mobile payment gateways, after creating scenarios to the actual appointment or interview. Any job seeker dealing with such an Agency, Employment Portal or Individual will be doing so solely at his or her own risk and Network18 and its Group Companies do not stand responsible for any damages suffered in the process, directly or indirectly. It will be in our mutual interest that should there be any suspicious activity pertaining to fraudulent enrolment noticed, it be reported to our Fraud & Misconduct Investigations team at recruitment.fraud@nw18.com ."

Vijay Verma was recently snapped at the Mumbai airport as he returned from Maldives after enjoying a romantic vacation with his actress-girlfriend Tamannaah Bhatia . While the Darlings actor was greeted by the paparazzi, he was left visibly irritated and upset when a photographer allegedly crossed the line. In a video that surfaced on social media, Vijay Verma is seen walking out of the airport. He sported a white shirt with light blue jeans and looked uber-cool as always. However, the actor got irritated as one of the shutterbugs said, “Maldives ke samandar ke maze le kar aaye ho (Seems you had a great time in Maldives)”. Responding to his, Varma said, “Iss tarah ki baat nahi kar sakte (You cannot talk like this)”. Watch the video here: A post shared by Instant Bollywood (@instantbollywood) Earlier in the day, Tamannaah Bhatia was also snapped by the paparazzi at the Mumbai airport when she was also asked about Vijay Varma. However, the actress was left blushing and she continued to smile. Prior to this, Tamannaah also shared a series of pictures from her Maldives getaway on her Instagram handle. In the first photo, Bhatia was seen enjoying on the beach, sporting a pink bikini and posing under an arching rainbow. In the second picture, she was seen drawing something on the sand. Some other snaps featured her resting on a hammock, enjoying delicious food, posing with a large jute hat on her head and more. While we did not see Vijay Varma in the vacation album, fans hoped that it was him who clicked the pictures. Tamannaah Bhatia and Vijay Varma’s relationship is no secret. The actress announced their romantic relationship in an interview with Film Companion earlier this year, when she said, “I don’t think you can get attracted to someone just because they are your co-star. I have had so many co-stars. I think if one has to fall for someone, feel something for someone it’s definitely more personal, it’s nothing to do with what they do for a living, I mean that’s not the reason why this would happen.”"

Later, Kartik also reacted to Sara confessing their relationship on Koffee With Karan. In an interview with Film Companion, the actor was confronted for lying about his relationship status in his previous interviews when he said, “Mai pichle sava saal se single hoon, baaki mujhe kuch nahi pataa (I have been single since the past 1.25 years, I don’t know about anything else).” However, the duo have become friends again. In fact, back in February, days after they were snapped together in Udaipur, they even started following each other again on Instagram. They had unfollowed each other on Instagram after their alleged breakup. Meanwhile on the work front, Kartik Aaryan was recently seen in Satyaprem Ki Katha with Kiara Advani.

    "article_content": "Curated By : Asmita Ravi Shankar News18.com Last Updated: September 04, 2023, 09:15 IST Chennai, India Udhayanidhi Stalin's controversial remark sparks debate and political reactions. (Udhayanidhi Stalin/Facebook) Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin in his podcast ‘Speaking for India’ took a swing at the Bharatiya Janata Party and said that they have taken “religion as their weapon” to hide all their flaws. “They are inciting the fire of religious sentiments of people and basking in the warmth of its fiery flames,” said Stalin. He began by accusing BJP of trying to hamper with India’s structure and destroy it’s sense of unity. He said that the purpose of this podcast is that as the leader of the third largest party in the Indian Parliament, and as someone who is one among the nation’s citizens, he wants to speak for India. Further taking a swing at BJP, Stalin said that the party has failed to fulfill its pre-election promises — including guaranteed employment to 2 crore people each year, double the income of farmers — especially people welfare schemes. “It has become a rudderless model,” said Stalin as he emphasised that the ‘Narendra Modi Model’ is going to end with no significant model to call their own. He went on to say that the party is using its power to transfer public sector to their corporate allies. DMK Has Always Been the Vanguard: Stalin Taking a note of his party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), CM Stalin said, “Whenever India’s diversity, federalism, and democracy has been threatened, DMK has always been the vanguard, standing at the frontline.” He quoted Perarignar Anna’s statement in the Council of States as, “You should take the DMK as the spearhead of the opposition to the unitary nature.” He said this was echoed by Kalaignar, who not only showed that DMK as a party from Tamil Nadu will always speak for India, adding that he also brought in structural and systemic changes to this order. “Now, there is another duty of historical importance that has come our way,” said Stalin in reference to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Stalin said that the 2024 polls is about “who should not come to power” rather than who should come to power, wondering whether it will be the INDIA alliance that will save India. Even as Stalin showed confidence in INDIA bloc, Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday hit out at the coalition over the remark made by CM’s son, Udhayanidhi, on an endonym frequently used to refer Hinduism – Sanatana Dharma. Shah said the Opposition bloc ‘hates Hinduism’. ALSO READ | Amit Shah Accuses INDIA Bloc Parties of Insulting ‘Sanatan Dharma’ for Votebank Politics Stalin’s podcast comes a day after Udhayanidhi Stalin’s comments on “eradicating Sanatan Dharma like diseases” sparked a row. Udhayanidhi had said, “There are some things which we have to eradicate and we can’t merely oppose. Mosquitoes, dengue fever, malaria, corona, all these are things which we cannot oppose, we have to eradicate them. Sanatanam is also like this. Eradicating, not opposing, Sanatanam should be our first task.” In his podcast — referring to BJP’s 9-year rule — Stalin said that there have been many harmful scams that have destroyed the states. Bringing in the example of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) he said that it has taken away the financial rights of the states, adding that Tamil Nadu lost its right to financial autonomy because of it. “From 2014 till last year, the tax paid by our state to the Union Government was 5 lakh 16 thousand crore rupees. But, in return, all we got was 2 lakh 8 thousand crore rupees,” he said. Questioning that “If it is argued that the Union Government cannot give the entirety of what they receive from each State, then how is it able to do it in BJP-ruled States?” He said that Tamil Nadu continues to face huge financial losses in the Finance Commission allocation. “In the 12th Finance Commission, the allocation of funds to Tamil Nadu was 5.305 percent. However, in the 15th Finance Commission, it was reduced to 4.079 percent,” he said, “The amount of money that Tamil Nadu loses every year isn’t negligible. We are losing thousands of crores which we should get rightfully.” An India where these facets — social justice, secular politics, socialism, equity, social harmony, state autonomy, federalism, and unity in diversity — thrive in its full glory is the real India, stated CM Stalin in his podcast. He said that the INDIA alliance has been formed to restore such a nation. Stalin said, “It is this INDIA alliance that is going to save India.” Further, raising the issue of Manipur and Haryana, Stalin cited the 2002 Gujarat violence and said that in 2023, sectarian fire ignited in the northeastern state of Manipur saw the State burn and the fire of religious fanaticism in Haryana is claiming lives and property of innocent people. Concluding his podcast, CM Stalin said, “Let’s carve out a multi-cultural and diverse India! Let’s save India. For that, let’s first SPEAK FOR INDIA!”"

(PTI) Central agencies have increased surveillance in cyberspace on the heels of the Khalistani graffiti incident in Delhi after it was observed that pro-Khalistan group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) has floated several websites ahead of the G20 Summit to dent India’s global image. The Centre has also initiated action under Section 69A of the IT Act, 2000, to ban websites fuelling anti-India propaganda. Sources said SFJ, which was banned last year, has increased the push for anti-India sentiment across the world and is enticing Sikh youth and farmers to join militancy. Pro-Khalistan entities are also targeting people not only in Punjab but also in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Indians living abroad to fuel their agenda apart from launching a campaign to register supporters through various websites. Recently, an analysis by a central agency after the graffiti incident found that various groups linked to Khalistan are threatening to target the G20 Summit. A top official aware of the developments said various websites having addresses similar to the official G20 website have been floated by Khalistani groups. These websites feature content against India and threaten to fuel anti-India agenda beginning September 8 when the G20 Summit kicks off. The official added that various videos have been uploaded by SFJ against India. To counter this, the agencies responsible for safeguarding cyber assets have started contacting the companies concerned where these websites, content or videos have been uploaded with the G20 logo. Last month, controversial pro-Khalistan slogans were seen at Shivaji Park, Madipur, Paschim Vihar, Udyog Nagar, Maharaja Surajmal Stadium, Government Sarvodya Bal Vidyalaya Nangloi, Punjai Bagh and Nangloi metro stations. Videos of the slogans were also sent to top Khalistani terrorists based in US and Canada and then a compiled video was released, threatening the security grid of the country ahead of G20. After the incident, the top brass of Delhi Police decided that while senior officers will be available in the district, mid-level officials and staff will be given dedicated places to look after. This includes markets, metro stations and other key places. Some areas have been divided into zones where Delhi Police officials have been given charge to keep a track on patrolling."

(Twitter) India will be taking on Nepal on Monday, September 4, at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Kandy. Nepal is coming off a very disappointing loss to Pakistan in their first match of the tournament. Nepal was completely outclassed by the Babar Azam-led side in the tournament opener. But Nepal is a young team who are playing for the first time in such a big tournament and has everything to gain from playing these top sides in the competition. Nepal’s batting heavily depends upon their captain Rohit Paudel, who has been great for them. In addition to him, their opener Aasif Sheikh has also performed really well. The key player for them is wrist spinner Sandeep Lamichhane who has made a name for himself. Lamichhane has picked up 112 wickets in just 50 matches and is a match-winner for them. Asia Cup 2023 Full Schedule | Asia Cup 2023 Complete Results | Asia Cup 2023 Full Coverage India would look to win this game and make sure they qualify for the Super 4 stage. India needs a lot of game time as many of their players are coming back to the side after a long hiatus and they will utilise this match as their chance to spend time in the middle. They will enter the match as the heavy favourites to win and claim their spot in the top four stage.

    "article_content": "Curated By : Kavya Mishra News18.com Last Updated: June 18, 2024, 13:07 IST New Delhi, India At least 9 people have died in the train accident. As probe in the Kanchanjunga accident deepens, a document suggested that the driver of the goods train involved in the collision with the Kanchanjunga Express was not at fault. However, the railways claimed that even though he was given a pass, the driver allegedly violated the distance protocol. According to Railways, after passing the signal, the loco pilot should ensure a minimum distance of 150 meters. It was earlier reported that a document, known as TA 912, was issued to the goods train driver by the station master of Ranipatra. It authorised the driver to pass all red signals because the automatic signalling system was defective However, railways have officially clarified that in TA 912, after passing the signal, the loco pilot should ensure that a minimum distance of 150 meters or two clear OHE spans is maintained between his train and the preceding train or any obstruction on the line, which was not done in the case. Further inquiry into this is underway. For the unversed, the TA 912 is issued to a train driver when the automatic signalling system fails, allowing the driver to pass all red signals in the affected section due to the signal defect Sources also confirmed that the automatic signalling system between Ranipatra and Chattar Hat Junction had been malfunctioning since 5:50 am on the day of the crash. The said document also states that with written permission, the deceased loco-pilot was authorised to cross all the nine signals that fall between RNI and CAT in speed, ignoring whether they are showing red or caution (yellow or double yellow). But Railways maintains that the driver failed to maintain the prescribed distance. The Railways also said that its rules mandate that when a loco pilot is given T/A 912 and he has to cross a signal at Red, then he needs to approach the signal at 10 kmph, bring his train to a stop as close as possible to the rear of a signal, wait for 1 minute during day time and 2 mins during night time at the signal and then proceed at 10 kmph It is also unclear why the station master issued the authorisation and speculated that they may have mistakenly believed that the previous train had already cleared the section. “The TA 912 is issued when there is no obstruction or any train on the line in the section, and it authorises the driver to cross red or caution signals. It is a matter of investigation why the station master did that. He might have been under the impression that the previous train crossed the station section and entered into another section,” the railway source explained. The fateful accident that killed at least 10 people and injured dozens took place between Ranipatra Railway Station and Chattar Hat Junction in West Bengal on Monday The Railway Board in its initial statement said the driver of the goods train violated the signal. It pegged the overall death toll at nine. Besides, 10 people were grievously injured and 32 suffered minor injuries. “The collision happened because a goods train disregarded the signal and hit the Kanchanjunga Express, which was on its way to Sealdah from Agartala,” Railway Board Chairperson Jaya Varma Sinha told reporters here soon after the accident that took place at 8:55 am. The Indian Railway Loco Runningmen Organisation (IRLRO) questioned the railways’ statement that the driver violated the red signal and called it highly objectionable to declare a dead loco-pilot responsible for the accident when the inquiry is underway. “Now, it is clear from the document that the loco pilot of the goods train was authorised to cross red signals because they were defective. This is the failure of the railway administration and not the fault of the driver,” the organisation’s working president Sanjay Pandhi said, “It is highly objectionable to announce that the loco pilot (of the goods train), who died in the accident, is responsible and also at a time when a CRS inquiry pending,” he said. The chief commissioner of Railway Safety, Northeast Frontier Railway, Janak Kumar Garg, will conduct a statutory inquiry into the Kanchenjunga Express. The probe will commence on June 19 and will be extended if necessary."

Actress Sonakshi Sinha is all set to tie the knot with her boyfriend Zaheer Iqbal on June 23 after seven years of dating. However, there are unverified rumours doing the rounds that Sonakshi’s father, actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha, is apparently upset with her as he wasn’t aware of her upcoming nuptials with Zaheer. Amid all of this, Sonakshi’s brother, Luv Sinha, has shared a throwback photo from his trip to Baku on his official Instagram handle. Interestingly, Luv doesn’t follow Sonakshi on Instagram (at the time of writing this article). Sharing the throwback photo, Luv wrote, “The problem with time is, that we never have enough of it. #Memories #Baku #Throwback #Streetphotography #Christmas #Nightlife #A7R5.” Earlier, Luv Sinha had reacted to the reports of her sister’s wedding to Zaheer Iqbal in a conversation with ETimes. Luv, who is reportedly out of the city, chose to remain tight-lipped about the matter. He told ETimes, “I’m out of Mumbai at the moment, and if it’s regarding the news published, I have no comment or involvement in the matter.” A post shared by Luv Sinha (@luvsinha) Meanwhile, Pahlaj Nihalani, who calls himself Sonakshi’s ‘mama’, has claimed that Shatrughan is miffed with Sonakshi for not informing him about her wedding plans. In his first reaction to the wedding rumours, Shatrughan had admitted that he wasn’t aware about the wedding. When Pahlaj Nihalani was asked about his reaction, he confirmed that Shatrughan was upset with Sonakshi but it wouldn’t last long. He added that Shatrughan would be attending the ceremony as well. Speaking with Times Now/Zoom, Pahlaj said “Ha (he is upset), but he can’t remain upset for long, not with Sonakshi. She is his laadli. Shaadi nahin attend karne ka koi sawaal hi nahi paida hota. As Shatruji said to you, aaj kal he bachche inform karte hain, permission nahin lete. Why should he be upset if Sonakshi is marrying the boy of her choice? Shatruji himself married a girl of his choice forty years ago. Even I chose my own life partner when I married my wife. One should not have unrealistic expectations from one’s children.” For the unversed, Shatrughan had told Times Now/Zoom that he had no clue about Sonakshi’s wedding and added, “I am being asked by people close to me why I am not aware of this (the supposed wedding), and the media is aware of it. All I can say is, aaj kal ke bachche consent nahin lete maa-baap ke, sirf inform karte hain. We are waiting to be informed.”"

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk Edited By: Shilpy Bisht News18.com Last Updated: June 15, 2024, 07:47 IST New Delhi, India The Supreme Court has said the 'sanctity' of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test-Undergraduate (NEET-UG), 2024 has been affected, and sought responses from the Centre and the NTA on conducting the exam again. (PTI File Photo) The Supreme Court will hear petitions regarding cancellation of the NEET-UG 2024 exam. One of the petitions was filed by chief executive of EdTech firm ‘Physics Wallah’, Alakh Pandey, against the alleged “grace marks\" given by the National Testing Agency (NTA) to more than 1,500 candidates who took the test for admissions into MBBS, BDS and others courses. The top court said on Tuesday that the “sanctity\" of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test-Undergraduate (NEET-UG), 2024 has been affected, and sought responses from the Centre and the NTA on another plea seeking holding of the examination afresh on grounds of alleged question paper leaks and other malpractices. The results of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) was declared on June 4, almost 10 days prior to the scheduled release, with an extraordinary large number of students scoring a percentile of 99.9971. Some secured 718 or 719 out of 720, which many claimed were impossible to get. Aspirants have raised these concerns and alleged irregularities and paper leaks. On June 1, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court asking that the examination be held again on the ground that the question paper had been leaked. Last month, hearing another petition, the top court had declined to stay the publication of the results. Around 2.4 million candidates took the entrance examination held on May 5 in 571 cities, 14 of which were outside India. According to the latest available data, there are a total of 1,08,940 MBBS seats in more than 700 medical colleges across the country. Compensatory Marks : After students filed petitions in the high courts, the NTA formed a Grievance Redressal Committee comprising examination and academic experts who reviewed the complaints based on factual reports and CCTV footage. They confirmed the loss of exam time and compensated 1,563 candidates based on the formula formulated by the Supreme Court in its June 13, 2018 judgment. The revised marks for these candidates ranged from -20 to 720, with two candidates scoring 718 and 719 due to compensatory marks. Case of 67 Toppers : The number of candidates appearing for NEET (UG) saw a significant increase, rising from 20,38,596 in 2023 to 23,33,297 in 2024. This year, 67 candidates got the perfect 720 out of 720 marks, achieving All India Rank 1. Last year, there were two toppers, and one in 2022. The NTA received 13,373 challenges to the provisional answer key for a Physics question. Forty-four of the 67 toppers got the answer to the basic Physics question wrong but they were given “grace marks\" because an older version of NCERT’s Class 12 textbook had a mistake. The experts decided that both the old and new options of NCERT textbook should be considered correct for the question. Consequently, 44 out of the 67 candidates who achieved a perfect score of 720/720 did so due to this revision, while six candidates received compensatory marks for lost time during the exam. Case of 718, 719 Scores : Many have claimed that it was impossible to score 716, 718 and 719 out of 720. According to an NTA press release, “The loss of examination time was ascertained and such candidates were compensated with marks based on their answering efficiency and time lost, as per the mechanism/ formula established by the Hon’ble Apex Court, vide its judgment dated 13.06.2018\". It also said, “1,563 candidates were compensated…and the revised marks of such candidates vary from – 20 to 720… Amongst these, the score of two candidates also happens to be 718 and 719 marks respectively due to compensatory marks.\" Unfair Means : The NTA is supporting investigating agencies in cases related to NEET, but has categorically denied any instance of a paper leak. According to the Economic Offences Unit of Bihar Police, admit cards, post-dated cheques and certificates from members of organised gang arrested in this case. Despite a “thorough\" investigation underway, the Special Investigation Team has said that the evidence collected so far is not enough to confirm a paper leak. The NTA has confirmed that some Hindi-medium students in Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan were mistakenly given English-medium question papers. They walked out of the examination hall taking the question paper with them, as mentioned in a report by The Indian Express . High Cut-offs : With more students taking the test, the NTA has kept the cut-offs unusually high this time. “The cut-off scores are determined based on the overall performance of candidates each year. The increase in cutoff reflects the competitive nature of the examination and the higher performance standards achieved by the candidates this year,\" the NTA release said. In 2022, when the average marks out of 720 of qualified candidates was 259, the minimum score to qualify in unreserved category was only 117, whereas in 2024, when the first number was 323.55, the cutoff was a high of 164, The Indian Express report said. In his petition, Physics Wallah’s Pandey collected representations from about 20,000 students, showing that 70-80 marks were randomly awarded as “grace marks\" to at least 1,500 students. His petition is regarding the grace marks awarded to students. Pandey has requested the Supreme Court to establish an expert panel under its supervision to “inquire into the examination process and results of NEET (UG) 2024.\" In another petition, Students Islamic Organisation (SIO) members Abdullah Mohammed Faiz and Dr Shaik Roshan Mohiddin seek to recall the NEET-UG 2024 results and conduct a fresh exam. The petitioners alleged arbitrariness in the granting of grace marks, pointing out that marks as high as 718 and 719 out of 720, secured by several students, were “statistically impossible\". They claimed that the NTA awarding grace marks was a malafide exercise to provide “backdoor entry\" to certain students, rather than compensating for “lost time\". The petitioners also raised suspicions about the fact that 67 students from one particular centre obtained full 720 marks. They have demanded a stay on counselling until an investigation into alleged paper leak is not conducted. In the third petition, NEET candidate Jaripiti Kartheek, challenged the award of grace marks as compensation for the “loss of time during the exam\". He said “normalisation formula\" for awarding grace marks should only apply to the number of questions left unanswered in proportion to the lost time, given that each question has equal weightage and assumes equal time distribution for answering each question. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 9 over the NEET-UG medical entrance exam, alleging that “irregularities\" in the examination have devastated more than 24 lakh students. On X, he posted, “Narendra Modi has not even taken oath yet and the scam in NEET exam has devastated more than 24 lakh students and their families. Six students from the same exam centre top the exam with maximum marks, many get such marks, which are technically not possible, but the government is continuously denying the possibility of paper leak\". Meanwhile, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra called for resolution of students’ “legitimate complaints\" through an investigation. “First the NEET exam paper was leaked and now the students allege that there has been a scam in its results as well. Serious questions are being raised on 6 students of the same centre getting 720 out of 720 marks and many kinds of irregularities are coming to the fore,\" she said. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also demanded a Supreme Court-monitored probe into the NEET exam result. Maharashtra Medical Education Minister Hasan Mushrif on June 8 alleged that the NEET exams were conducted after taking money. “The results are such that no student of Maharashtra will get admission for the MBBS course in government or private college in the state,\" he said. Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin reiterated his government’s stand on NEET, and said the exam system goes against social justice and federalism. “Trends emerging from the latest NEET results have once again vindicated our principled opposition to the exam. Issues such as question paper leaks, clustering of toppers at specific centres, and award of marks, which are mathematically impossible, under the guise of grace marks highlight the pitfalls of the current Union government’s centralisation,\" Stalin wrote on X. The exam is pre-qualifying test for MBBS and BDS programmes just like the All India Pre-Medical Entrance Test (AIPMT) held every year. The exams are conducted by the NTA. Earlier, the Central Bureau of Secondary Examination (CBSE) used to conduct the medical test before NTA took over. The NTA is an independent autonomous and self-sustained premier testing organisation. The NEET is conducted every year in May and offers 90,000 seats in MBBS and BDS colleges in India. A student who wishes to study medical courses needs to have Physics, Chemistry, Biology / Biotechnology as their compulsory subjects in Class 10, and 12, and must have passed these subjects. The candidate has to show their passing certificate at the time of the counselling round. Marks in Mathematics are not considered in NEET-undergraduate exam (NEET-UG). Besides, the undergraduate courses, NTA also administers NEET post-graduation (NEET-PG), an eligibility-cum-ranking examination prescribed as the single entrance examination for admission to various MD/MS and PG diploma courses. The NEET exam is conducted online and in 11 languages — English, Hindi, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, Marathi, Urdu Bengali, Telugu, Kannada, and Assamese. The examination is conducted for three hours and a candidate needs to answer 180 questions."

(Photo: AP File) Prime Minister Narendra Modi will begin his first foreign visit to Italy after being sworn-in as prime minister for the third time on Sunday. He will be attending the G7 outreach meet in Italy’s Apulia region today addressing Artificial Intelligence, energy, and regional issues in Africa and Mediterranean. Modi will meet Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said at a briefing on Wednesday, but did not comment on which other leaders the PM would hold bilateral meetings with. The high-profile event will see leaders from the G7 member states namely the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is also expected to be present. The group was formed by the world’s most industrialised and powerful economies to promote collective decision-making on the issues of economic governance, international security and peace and most recently Artificial Intelligence. Russia was part of the G7 bloc from 1998 through 2014 but its membership was suspended following its annexation of the Crimea region. The G7 has faced challenges in recent times through increased tension with Russia after its military offensive in Ukraine and disagreements over trade and climate policies with China. The G7 imposed sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine and launched a global infrastructure investment programme to counter China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The G7 summit in southern Italy from June 13 to June 15 will discuss the conflicts in the Gaza Strip, Ukraine, migration, climate change and AI. Ukraine : The US has proposed using profits from the $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine, and issuing a $50 billion loan from the US government to Kyiv, using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral. Israel-Gaza Conflict : The US has already proposed an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the release of hostages, increased humanitarian aid for Gaza and a comprehensive peace agreement to ensure the security of both Israelis and Gazans. The proposal was already supported by G7 countries and members of the United Nations Security Council and underscores the urgency to address the conflict. Climate Change : Although the G7 aims for a 40-42% reduction in emissions by 2030, current policies suggest that only a 19-33% reduction is achievable. The summit will focus on reinforcing commitments and exploring innovative strategies to meet climate goals. Migration : Italy, which for decades has been ground zero in Europe’s migration debate, has been promoting its Mattei Plan as a way to create jobs and opportunity in Africa and discourage its young people from making dangerous trips across the Mediterranean Sea. Artificial Intelligence : Pope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses. He will also address the issue at G7 summit. There will be talks on establishing governance on AI technologies, promoting energy transitions and supporting development and cooperation in the Africa-Mediterranean region. China’s Industrial Policy : The discussion will raise concerns over China’s industrial overcapacity, measures to level the playing field and consider potential sanctions to counter heavily subsidized Chinese companies. Prime Minister Modi would discuss his plans for his new term in office even as US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak face elections this year. This is the 11th time that India has been invited to the G7 outreach, and Modi will attend the event fifth time. “India’s regular participation at the G-7 summit clearly points to increasing recognition and contribution of the efforts India has been consistently making in trying to resolve global challenges, including those of peace, security, development, and environmental preservation,” foreign secretary Kwatra told journalists. Reports suggest that India is yet to announce its participation in a peace conference on Ukraine in a Swiss town of Burgenstock held by the G7 leaders. India would, however, participate at an “official but not at a political level”. “India will be participating at the Peace summit in Switzerland on the [June] 15th,” Kwatra said as quoted by The Hindu . “That consideration is currently going on in the system and as and when we have a decision on the representative from India who would be participating, we would be happy to share that with you,” he added. There could be an exchange between Modi and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau amid tense ties between the two countries over Trudeau’s allegation that “Indian government agents” were behind the killing of a Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey last year in June. The G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort in a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia’s medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010. Located next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favourite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit, according to news agency Associated Press ."

These four gates are represented by four animals. (File pic/News18) The BJP won big in Odisha in both the Lok Sabha as well as assembly elections, decimating the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) that ruled the state for almost a quarter of a century. In its electoral promise, the BJP had said it will open all four gates of Puri’s Jagannath Temple for devotees once it came to power. And it did. Thursday saw all four gates of the mighty 12th Century temple, which were shut since the Covid-19 pandemic, opened for public. Due to closure of three doors of the shrine except the ‘Singhadwara’ (Lion Gate), devotees were facing a lot of hardships in the darshan of the ‘Holy Trinity’. Ashwa Dwara (Horse Gate), Vyaghra Dwara (Tiger Gate), Hasti Dwara (Elephant Gate) remained shut until Thursday. At his first Cabinet meeting, chief minister Mohan Majhi cited the inconvenience caused to the devotees by the shutting of the four doors. He also announced Rs 500 crore for temple beautification and repair. The outer wall of the temple has four gates, which open in four different directions. These four gates are represented by four animals. In the east, there are lions and hence it is called Lion Gate or ‘Singhadwara’. The west direction is represented by tigers and hence it is called Tiger Gate or ‘Vyaghradwara’. The northern direction of the temple wall is represented by elephants. So, it is named as Elephant Gate or ‘Hastidwara’. The southern direction, represented by horses, is known as Horse Gate or ‘Ashvadwara’. Singhadwara : The two lion statues on ‘Singhadwara’ in a crouching position symbolises ‘Mokshya’ (liberation). It is named after the Narasimha avatar (incarnation) of Lord Vishnu. Jagannath is also considered an avatar of Lord Vishnu. As per popular belief, if a devotee enters the temple through this gate, he/she will get ‘mokshya’. Ashvadwara : Horse symbolically represents ‘Kama’ or lust. There are two galloping horses with Jagannath and Balabhadra on their back in the martial glory near the door. As per the legend, the devotee sacrifices the feeling of lust while entering through this gate. It is also known as the road of victory. The kings used to enter the temple through this gate seeking the Lord’s blessing to win battles. Vyaghradwara : Tiger is the symbol of Dharma (one’s own self), which is an important philosophy in the Hindu religion. In each and every moment, the spiritual seeker needs to adhere with his/her Dharma. Entering the temple through Vyaghradwara reminds the devotee about his/her Dharma and bolsters the spirit. The sages and special devotees enter and temple through this gate. Hastidwara : It has colossal figure of elephants on each side. Elephant is regarded as the carriage for the Goddess of wealth — Maha Lakshmi. Devotees seeking wealth enter the temple through this gate. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah have raked up the issue of the “missing” keys of the Ratna Bhandar, the inner treasury of the Jagannath Temple, and blamed BJD, led by Naveen Patnaik, for its failure to come clean on inventorying the jewellery and precious stones stored in it. “The tradition of Jagannath Dham has been lowered in the name of promoting Puri as tourist hub. The Shreekshetra (Puri) has been transformed into a commercial centre. The mutts have been demolished and the four entry doors of Jagannath Temple remain closed. There was conspiracy to stop Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath,” Shah had said in public meetings. According to a statement given by the Odisha government led by Patnaik in the Assembly, the Ratna Bhandar was last opened in 1985 but the latest inventories of the valuables were made in 1978. Until 1985, nobody had seen the inner chamber of the Ratna Bhandar, which was divided into two parts. The Puri Jagannath temple is one of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites in India. The other three Dham are Badrinath, Dwarka, and Rameswaram. Lakhs of devotees throng Puri in Odisha to visit Lord Jagannath Temple every year. Lord Jagannath, represented by Lord Krishna, is present in the temple along with his elder brother Lord Balbhadra and younger sister Goddess Subhadra. The annual Ratha Yatra, or chariot festival, at the Puri temple is well-known for featuring the three main deities being hauled by enormous, ornately decorated temple cars. • The flag at the top of the temple flutters in an opposite direction in which the wind blows. A priest climbs atop of the temple to change the flag every day for the 1,800 years. It is believed if the ritual is skipped even for a day, then the temple will remain closed for 18-long years. The temple is as tall as a 45-storey building, and the flag is changed with bare hands without any protective gear. • The icon of Jagannath is made of wood and ceremoniously replaced every 12 or 19 years by a replica, in contrast to the stone and metal symbols found in the majority of Hindu temples. Sacred neem trees with rigid specifications are used for the purpose. The carving is done in secrecy by selected carpenters for 21 days. The old idols are buried in the Koili Vaikuntha. The last Nabakalebara ritual took place in 2015 was witnessed by millions. • It is an architectural wonder or simply a miracle that no matter what time of the day it is or in where the sunlight is falling, the temple does not have a shadow. • The Mahaprasad is served to Lord Jagannath in five phases and consists of 56 delectable delicacies from dry confectionaries to ‘shankhudi’ rice, dal and other items. It is available for devotees in Ananda Bazaar, which is located on the temple premises itself. • Once a devotee enters the temple, they don’t hear the sound of waves. According to myth, Goddess Subhadra wished that the temple would be a place of serenity, and to please her, the temple does not reflect the sound of sea waves. • No bird, not even a plan can be seen hovering over the temple. A bird cannot even be seen sitting atop the temple. There is no logical explanation to that. • A wheel of fortune or ‘chakra’, which weighs a tonne, is placed at the top of the temple. The fact about the chakra is that it would appear the same to the viewer from any angle or height at any point in Puri. • It is a natural phenomenon that the breeze blows from sea towards land during the day, and from land towards the sea in the evening. But the reverse happens in Puri. • Every year, lakhs of devotees visit the temple during the Rath Yatra or visit Lord Jagannath. Every day the same amount of food is cooked. None of the food ever gets wasted or no devotee is unfed."

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk Edited By: Shilpy Bisht News18.com Last Updated: June 13, 2024, 17:14 IST New Delhi, India Over 8.8 million people, aged 60 and above, are living with dementia in India. Alzheimer’s is one of the most common forms of dementia. (Getty Image) A new drug to reduce the risks of Alzheimer’s Disease has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), bringing the treatment a step closer to use in the clinic, as per Nature journal. The drug, Donanemab, made by Eli Lilly, modestly slows down the cognitive decline in patients in the early stages of the disease but also had significant safety risks, as per The New York Times . “The potential risks of Donanemab, appropriately managed as instructed in labeling, are outweighed by the demonstrated benefits on the clinical endpoints in those with AD (Alzheimer’s disease),” the FDA advisory committee said in a briefing document. It is a type of dementia that affects memory, thinking and behaviour and becomes severe enough to interfere with daily tasks. It is a general term for memory loss and other cognitive abilities. Alzheimer’s accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases. The majority of people with Alzheimer’s are over 65 years of age. In its early stages, memory loss is mild, but with late-stage Alzheimer’s, individuals lose the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to their environment. On average, a person with Alzheimer’s lives four to eight years after diagnosis but can live as long as 20 years, depending on other factors. Severe symptoms include disorientation, mood and behaviour changes; deepening confusion about events, time and place; unfounded suspicions about family, friends and professional caregivers; more serious memory loss and behaviour changes; and difficulty speaking, swallowing and walking. Alzheimer’s disease is caused by the accumulation of amyloid beta protein (Aβ) in the brain, leading to neuronal toxicity in the central nervous system (CNS). It can be hereditary or acquired. The drug is meant for those who are in the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease – those who have mild cognitive degeneration or mild dementia. According to the Nature journal, Donanemab is an antibody that attacks amyloid. Eli Lilly reported that the 622 trial participants who received the drug and completed the trial lost their cognitive abilities more slowly over the study period than did those who received a placebo. However, the drug did not reverse the disease’s progression. The main adverse effects of the drug cause ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities) such as swelling or bleeding in the brain, most of which is asymptomatic, and can be resolved or stabilised after discontinuation of therapy, as per FDA. “The key risks can be mitigated through appropriate labeling and clinical monitoring, and further characterized through post-authorization studies… Overall, given the seriousness of AD and the limited options for disease-modifying treatments, donanemab provides a clinically meaningful treatment benefit for patients with AD,” the FDA document said. The study showed that 24% participants given Donanemab had brain swelling and 19.7% had brain bleeds. Three treatment related deaths were reported in the study. But the FDA concluded that there were still too many unanswered questions about the data so far, including no clear guidance for doctors on which levels of amyloid would warrant restarting treatment, and what the long-term outlook of people who stopped and started would be, as per TIME . Two similar amyloid-fighting drugs were approved recently: Leqembi, made by Eisai and Biogen, was approved last year. The drug’s risks and modest benefits are similar to those of Donanemab. Aduhelm, made by Biogen, is the other drug approved in 2021 but was discontinued because there was insufficient evidence that it could benefit patients. In India, a study conducted in 2023 revealed that over 8.8 million people, aged 60 and above, are living with dementia in the country. The prevalence of dementia, including Alzheimer’s, is almost double that in men. The figure is likely to increase to 14 million by 2050. The World Alzheimer Report (2015) and other studies have projected the global direct cost of dementia care (including ADRDs and other dementias) to be $2 trillion by 2030, while the direct and indirect cost (which includes lost wages of caregivers) of care is estimated to rise to $9.12 trillion by 2050."

The higher the rating, the safer the car will be and the number of deaths in road accidents will be fewer. (Representational photo: Cartoq) Taking a long overdue step towards reducing deaths on the streets, the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) launched the Bharat New Car Assessment Programme (Bharat NCAP) last year, and on Thursday, two electric cars received the first five-star rating under it. Cars are given star ratings based on their performance in crash tests. On Thursday, two of Tata’s cars – Punch.ev and Nexon.ev – became the first five-star Bharat NCAP-rated electric vehicles in the Indian automotive market. While giving away the certificate, union minister Nitin Gadkari, who assumed charge of MorTH again on Wednesday, posted on social media site X that electric vehicles spearhead the future of mobility in India and a strong Bharat NCAP rating serves as an invaluable tool for consumers in selecting safer vehicles. The rating, he said, stands as a testament to the high level of safety provided to the vehicle’s occupants. Congratulations to @tataev @TataMotors for achieving a 5-star Bharat NCAP rating for the Punch.ev and Nexon.ev, thus becoming the first ever 5-star rated EVs in the Indian automotive market.As electric vehicles spearhead the future of mobility in India, a strong Bharat NCAP… pic.twitter.com/VY7f7p0VVQ — Nitin Gadkari (@nitin_gadkari) June 13, 2024 Bharat NCAP was launched in October 2023 to enhance road safety for vehicle owners in India. It is for vehicles manufactured in India as well as imported ones. The cars will be given star ratings based on their performance in crash tests. The higher the rating, the safer the car will be and the number of deaths in road accidents will be fewer. The ministry, while launching the rating, had said that this is a landmark step towards empowering consumers to be able to make a better choice for buying safer cars. Further, it will also push the safety and quality of vehicles in India, along with promoting healthy competition among manufacturers to develop safer vehicles. It is a first-of-its-kind car assessment programme in India and is applicable to vehicles of category M1 with a gross weight of less than 3.5 tonnes. The M1 category includes motor vehicles used for the carriage of passengers, comprising not more than eight seats, in addition to the driver’s seat. As per MoRTH, the programme is designed to give a fair, meaningful and objective assessment of the crash safety performance of cars based on standard laboratory tests. The ministry has laid down guidelines and mechanisms to inform consumers about the assessment. Also, it is a voluntary programme, except otherwise stated in the vehicle selection guideline monitored by the ministry. The base variants of a given model will be tested for giving star ratings. The cars will be assessed under three areas and based on the performance of the vehicle model the star ratings will be issued. These are – Adult Occupant Protection (AOP), Child Occupant Protection (COP), and Safety Assist Technologies. For each of the assessment areas, there are individual tests and assessments. According to the final draft of the Bharat NCAP, issued in July 2023, the programme will award separate ratings for a new vehicle for Adult Occupant Protection and Child Occupant Protection based on performance in full vehicle crash tests and score achieved and fitment of safety assist technologies. The policy specifies three crash tests that must be performed on a new car for the assessment of star rating. These are – Offset Deformable Barrier Frontal Impact Test, Side Impact Test, and Pole Side Impact Test. According to the ministry’s Road Accidents in India 2022 report, 4.61 lakh road accidents were reported in 2022, killing 1.68 lakh people and injuring 4.43 lakh. Before that, in 2021, at least 1.53 lakh lives were lost due to road accidents in India, the highest since 2011. There were 25,431 accidents and 9,191 deaths related to cars, taxis and vans, the report added. The test results and ratings will empower consumers to make informed decisions. In a series of posts on X, Tata celebrated the five-star rating for its cars. In one of the posts, the company said, “We crushed it – literally!”. “We are prouder than ever to have designed India’s safest vehicle #Punchev…It received a 5-star safety rating with the highest ever score of 31.46/32 points for AOP (adult occupant protection) and 45/49 points COP (child occupant protection) from BNCAP,” it said. The maximum score for AOP is 32 points while the maximum COP rating stands at 49 points. Nexon.ev has scored 29.86/32 points for AOP and 44.95/49 points for COP from Bharat NCAP."

(AFP Photo) The just concluded G7 Summit in Italy has laid emphasis on the India-Europe Corridor also known as the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) to improve strategies ties among the countries amid West Asia tensions, which may have delayed the project. The Communique was issued on June 14 after the customary “family photo” at the luxury resort of Borgo Egnazia in Italy, where the G7 also reiterated a commitment to a “free and open Indo-Pacific” based on the rule of law. “We will further promote concrete G7 PGII (Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment) initiatives, flagship projects, and complementary initiatives to develop transformative economic corridors for quality infrastructure and investment, such as the deepening of our coordination and financing for the Lobito Corridor, the Luzon Corridor, the Middle Corridor, and the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, also building on the EU Global Gateway, the Great Green Wall Initiative, and the Mattei Plan for Africa launched by Italy,” reads the communique. India has already started the work on the IMEC that was announced on the sidelines of the G20 Leaders Summit in Delhi last year. But there are rail links in Saudi Arabia and other countries that need to be established. The IMEC is a connectivity project that seeks to develop infrastructure ports, railways, roads, sea lines and pipelines to improve trade among India, the Arabian Peninsula, the Mediterranean region and Europe, and potentially open greater access to the African continent. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the IMEC was signed in September 2023 in New Delhi during the G-20 summit by India, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), France, Germany, Italy, the US and the EU. In addition to the signatories of the MoU, Israel and Greece have also expressed enthusiasm about joining the project. The Hamas attacks of October 7 and the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza present the latest challenge to the IMEC. Any project connecting Jordan with Israel will face strong opposition from the Jordanian public, especially the Palestinian population, and the government has taken a firm stance against Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, according to think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Many also believe that the IMEC could have helped prevent some of the disruption caused by the tension around the Red Sea and allowed for smoother movement of goods to Europe. The attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels around Red Sea caused a massive delay in shipment, forcing ships to take a much longer route. The IMEC is also seen as an initiative by like-minded nations to gain strategic influence in the face of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has faced increasing criticism over lack of transparency and disregard for sovereignty of the nations. A practical economic challenge for the IMEC is that the Arabian Gulf countries are not manufacturing hubs. Therefore, the freights will be costlier if they have to remain empty, as per an article written by a JNU Associate Professor. Another important point noted is that three big regional economies in the Middle East, namely Türkiye, Egypt and Iran, and other smaller but vibrant economies, namely Iraq, Qatar and Kuwait, have been left out of the IMEC, making it inherently lacking in the idea of bringing greater economic integration. The Indian government wants to build on the existing trade and economic relations between India and the Arab Gulf region, which has the potential to grow further if the necessary infrastructure and connectivity gaps are filled, and the IMEC “precisely intends to do that”. The IMEC also connects the other regional countries, especially Israel and Jordan, important regional partners of India, making it even more economically attractive. India’s economic presence in the region will increase and create opportunities for Indian companies to invest in building the missing infrastructure. Not just in the Middle East, the IMEC promises to connect India with the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Europe with a shorter route bypassing checkpoints of Bab al-Mandab and the Suez Canal. Another geopolitical reason for India to root for IMEC is to emerge as a faster global power considering how it has carved out a path for economic growth since 1991 and being part of the G20. Even though the US is pushing for IMEC as a counter to BRI, China has already a considerable influence along the proposed route of IMEC. An important link in IMEC is the Greek port of Piraeus —the largest port in Eastern Europe—which will receive cargo coming from the Haifa port in Israel. The Chinese shipping company Cosco has been the majority stakeholder in the port since 2016, when the Greek government sold the company two-thirds stakes. Thus, this Chinese company has all the powers to decide the future of the port and control the piers and terminals, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The deep financial ties between China and Arab Gulf can limit IMEC’s future. Trade between China and Saudi Arabia stood at more than $106 billion in 2022, almost double the value of US-Saudi trade. China has also acquired a minority 20% stake in Red Sea Gateway Terminal, the largest port in Saudi Arabia. The value of non-oil China-UAE trade exceeded $72 billion in 2022 alone, and China has already invested in multiple development schemes."

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk Edited By: Shilpy Bisht News18.com Last Updated: June 16, 2024, 14:10 IST New Delhi, India According to estimates from a digital privacy research group, Pakistan has shut down the internet for 1,752 hours so far in 2024. (Getty Image) Pakistan now joins countries like China, Iran, Turkey, and Russia in employing a national firewall to regulate internet content. The Pakistani media has reported that the country will be implementing a firewall to control social media access to X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and YouTube. The Pakistan government has agreed to the internet service providers to install a firewall which will have a special feature ‘Deep Packet Inspection’ capability. The move follows the temporary blocking of X in Pakistan earlier this year. The government said the goal is to stop the spread of “undesirable content”, which includes propaganda and content deemed offensive by the government. The Pakistan government justified the blocking of X website citing non-compliance with laws and its alleged failure to register within the country. Firewall is a security tool that stops online traffic from reaching to a particular website. They can prevent malicious actors from targeting individual users’ computer systems or home networks, and even thwart cyber threats on specific websites. You can also look at the settings of your personal computer that has the options to set up firewalls with different restriction levels. A firewall can be a physical device, or a software-based tool. It depends on a specific user’s needs. • The firewall will reportedly use Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology to examine the data packets and identify the source of propaganda material. • Keyword filtering will be used to identify and block content deemed undesirable by the government, potentially including blasphemy, hate speech, or content critical of the state. • The government will also regulate Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which some users have employed to bypass restrictions on X. The temporary blocking of X in Pakistan has reduced its user base from 4.5 million to 2.4 million. Whenever an Internet shutdown or block is implemented, the country’s citizens suffer a huge setback, education is disrupted, and healthcare institutions struggle to provide quality care. According to estimates from the digital privacy research group Top10VPN, Pakistan has shut down the internet for 1,752 hours so far in 2024. Firewalls can be restrictive and can limit users from performing legitimate operations. These restrictions can impede productivity and even prompt users to begin utilising backdoor exploits to work around them. Firewalls can also bring up antitrust concerns. Well-performing companies and businesses that would normally gain more users may be blocked and replaced by government-approved alternatives with lower privacy and service standards, degrading the Internet user’s experience even further. Software firewalls tend to be less expensive and easier to deploy, but require terminal resources. Hardware firewalls require purchase and installation for each network node, which in large-scale corporate networks can be costly depending on the firewalls purchased. In 2012, the Pakistan’s government blocked around 20,000 websites, including YouTube, per a Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) official. In 2017, Jack Dorsey-led Twitter posted on its Global Government Affairs account that it was aware of reports that the “Pakistani government has taken action to block Twitter service, as well as other social media services.” During the recent general elections in Pakistan, its government blocked access to X for days earlier this year. Internet service was largely affected during this period. “Pakistani authorities have already imposed multiple shutdowns that disrupted opposition activities during this election cycle. At least 11 Internet shutdowns were imposed during the last election year of 2018, and the authoritarian use of shutdowns has only emboldened through 2022, 2023, and now 2024,” said digital rights advocacy group Access Now, in a statement in February, as quoted by The Hindu ."

(Getty Image) President Droupadi Murmu has rejected the mercy petition of a Pakistani national Mohammed Arif who was sentenced to death for the December 22, 2000 terrorist attack at the Red Fort in Delhi in which three people including two Army jawans were killed. The President’s decision came after Arif’s attempts to seek relief from the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court in his appeals against a trial court verdict dating back to October 2005 were unsuccessful. In 2007, the Delhi High Court confirmed the trial court’s decision following which Arif moved an appeal in the Supreme Court. On August 10, 2011, a Bench dismissed the appeal by characterising the attack as “a blatant, brazen-faced and audacious act aimed to overawe the government of India”. Highlighting the historical significance of the Red Fort as a national monument, the Bench concluded that the case met the “rarest of rare” standard for awarding the death penalty. But Arif continued to file successive petitions at the Supreme Court against the death sentence. Two Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists sneaked into the Red Fort and opened fire, killing two jawans of the Army’s Rajputana Rifles regiment and civilian security guard in the evening of December 22, 2000. Assault rifles abandoned outside the Red Fort, and four detonators with warning tags in Urdu were found by investigators. A polythene bag containing a slip which had a mobile number written on it was also found, which led the Delhi Police to Arif alias Ashfaq. He was arrested along with his wife on December 26. Delhi Police filed a chargesheet against Arif and 21 others on February 20, 2001, and a supplementary chargesheet on March 25 that year. The trial of 11 accused began on September 11, 2001. Over the next three years, the prosecution examined 235 witnesses, and the trial court reserved judgment on October 14, 2005. On October 31, the court found seven of the accused guilty, and sentenced Arif to death. In 2007, the Delhi High Court confirmed the trial court’s decision to sentence Arif to death. Arif then appealed to the Supreme Court. The first review petition was rejected in August 2012, and the curative petition — heard by the five senior-most judges of the Supreme Court only on limited grounds — was rejected in January 2014. The case was then placed before a three-judge Bench led by former Chief Justice of India UU Lalit. On November 3, 2022, nearly 22 years after the attack, the Bench rejected Arif’s plea, finding that “there was a direct attack on the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India.” The President and Governor can pardon relief to convicts who have been sentenced to death. Under Articles 72 and 161, both constitutional authorities have the power to “grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence”. However, the President does not exercise this power independently — Article 74 mandates that he or she has to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers. Thus, the President and Governor can examine the merits of the case independently and decide whether the convict can be pardoned. Moreover, Article 74(2) of the Constitution prohibits any court from enquiring into “the question whether any, and if so what, advice was tendered by Ministers to the President”. This implies that there is no way to scrutinise how a President arrived at a decision unless the Council itself chooses to divulge the recommendation. If a High Court or the Supreme Court has awarded death sentence to a convict, then he or she can file a mercy petition to the Home department of the concerned state. The petition is then forwarded to the Governor with its advice on whether to accept or reject it. If the Governor declines the petition, then it is forwarded to the Ministry of Home Affairs, which sends it to the President, seeking advice. The President can agree with the recommendation or send it back for reconsideration. However, if the same recommendation is reiterated, the President is constitutionally obligated to accept it. In 2006, the Supreme Court in Epuru Sudhakar & Another v. Andhra Pradesh highlighted the grounds for review by ruling that a decision under Article 72 can be challenged if it was passed without application of mind; it is mala fide; it was passed on extraneous or wholly irrelevant considerations; relevant materials were kept out of consideration; it suffers from arbitrariness, as quoted by The Hindu . In executive procrastination, the Top Court has said it violates the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. It ruled that “undue, inordinate and unreasonable delay” in dealing with a mercy petition amounted to torture. There have been reports that speculated former Presidents such as KR Narayan, APJ Abdul Kalam and Pratibha Patil sat on mercy petitions where they disagreed with the government’s advice. Moreover, former President Pranab Mukherjee is said to have rejected the advice of the government while commuting the death sentence in five cases."

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk Edited By: Shilpy Bisht News18.com Last Updated: June 17, 2024, 10:29 IST New Delhi, India A Mid-Day report has alleged that a mobile phone was used to generate an OTP to unlock the EVMs at the time of counting of votes by an aide of Shiv Sena’s Ravindra Dattaram Waikar. (Image: Instagram/Ravindra Waikar) An Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) unlocked in the Mumbai North West Lok Sabha constituency by phone by a Shiv Sena candidate has created a political slugfest. An Election Commission (EC) official, however, has rejected the claim and said the “robust” system does not require an OTP to hack it. A report by Mid-Day newspaper has alleged that a mobile phone was used to generate a one-time password (OTP) to unlock the EVMs at the time of counting of votes on June 4 by an aide of Shiv Sena’s Ravindra Dattaram Waikar, who defeated Shiv Sena (UBT) candidate Amol Gajanan Kirtikar on Mumbai North West seat in Maharashtra. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and other Opposition leaders on Sunday cited the report that also said the candidate won by thin margin of 48 votes with his mobile phone found “connected” to an EVM during the vote count. But Mumbai Suburban District Election Officer Vandana Suryavanshi has said on X that no such OTP was used to unlock an EVM. Suryavanshi said an EVM is a non-programmable machine and has no wireless communication capabilities. She, however, said the incident has raised some concerns of “unauthorizedly using a mobile phone of an unauthorized person by a candidate aide”. She said a criminal case has already been filed by the EC. “EVMs are standalone devices without any wired or wireless connectivity with units outside EVM system. Advanced technical features and robust administrative safeguards are in place to rule out any possibility of manipulation. Safeguards include conducting everything in the presence of candidates or their agents,” said Suryavanshi. A report by the Mid-Day mentions raises questions at the credibility of EVMs. The newspaper reported that the police are investigating the role of Mangesh Pandilkar, a relative and aide of Ravindra Waikar, and Dinesh Gurav, on the day of counting of votes at NESCO Centre in Mumbai. The police said Pandilkar was using his mobile phone to generate OTPs to “unlock” the EVMs. The paper further reported that the police had found that Gurav had used the same phone to generate the OTP to unlock the Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot System (ETPBS) for service voter. Shiv Sena’s Waikar lost on the EVM votes for the Mumbai North West seat, but won after the postal ballots were factored in. Kirtikar of Shiv Sena (UBT) got 4,51,095 EVM votes against 4,51,094 of Waikar. Then, as the postal ballots were counted, the situation flipped. Waikar got 1,550 votes via postal ballots and Kirtikar got 1,501. The final count stood at Waikar’s 4,52,644 and Kirtikar’s 4,52,596. “Counting of ETPBS happens in physical form (paper ballots) and not electronics as being spread through false narratives. Every counting sheet at every table for ETPBS and EVM counting and postal ballot counting (including ETPBS) is signed by all counting agents after due diligence,” said the ECI. Postal ballots, or absentee voting, allow certain individuals to vote by mail instead of in person. This option is available to members of the Armed Forces, paramilitary forces, election officials, government employees, the elderly, and the physically challenged. Recently, media personnel covering elections have also been granted this option. Voters must apply using Form 12 D, receive their ballot by mail, and return it within a specified time. In the 2019 parliamentary elections, 22.71 lakh postal ballots were received, accounting for 0.37% of the total 60.76 crore valid votes. Postal ballots are counted before EVM votes. As per EC guidelines, the counting of postal ballots begins 30 minutes before EVM counting. Although EVM counting can proceed without completing postal ballot counting, the final EVM results should not be announced before finalising postal ballot counts. The changes were introduced in 2019 that led to an increase in postal ballots. In the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, the winning margin was significantly smaller than the number of postal ballots, highlighting their potential impact. Similarly, in the 2019 Arunachal Pradesh Assembly elections, postal ballots reversed the initial EVM results, changing the winning candidate. Designed by the Election Commission, this system is developed for service voters who are entitled to cast their vote electronically from outside their constituency. Central Forces under Arms Act and Government officials deployed in Embassies outside the country are classified as service voters. It is a secured system with a two-layer security system. Secrecy is maintained through the use of OTP and PIN and no duplication of casted Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot (ETPB) is possible due to the unique QR Code. This system has been set up in line with the existing Postal Ballot System and is an easier option for facilitating voting by the electors as the time constraint for dispatch of the postal ballot has been addressed using this system. The ETPBS was used for the first time in 2019. The ETPBS enabled 18,02,646 service voters to register their votes in the 2019 elections. While in 2014, there were 13,27,627 registered service electors. After the elections, the EVMs are securely stored in “strong rooms”, equipped with a single access door and protected by a two-layered security cordon. Candidates’ agents are permitted to maintain a continuous vigil over the EVMs until counting day. The locks on these strong rooms bear the seals of election officials as well as the candidates or their representatives. A list of EVM serial numbers used in the poll, along with the number of votes polled in each, is shared with candidates and their agents for verification during the counting. After polling, EVMs are sealed in their carrying cases at the polling stations in the presence of polling agents, who also sign the seals alongside the polling officer. The battery, the only power source for the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT), is removed at the polling station in the presence of polling agents after the poll concludes. Live feed from CCTV cameras covering the entry to strong rooms is provided to candidates’ representatives stationed at the counting centre. The strong rooms housing polled EVMs are secured with two-tier security arrangements. On the counting day, the EVM seals and serial numbers are verified by candidates’ counting agents before the counting begins. Any discrepancies are immediately reported and addressed, ensuring that the machines have not been tampered with since the poll ended. After verification, the control unit of each EVM is powered on, and the ‘Result’ button is pressed. This action displays the number of votes each candidate received. Counting supervisors then record these results on a result sheet, ensuring accuracy and accountability. After all the votes from the EVMs are tallied, the results from each table are compiled to form the final tally for the constituency. This process is done meticulously to ensure that the final results reflect the true will of the voters."

(Photo: PTI) The government’s move to relocate the statues of Mahatma Gandhi and BR Ambedkar within the Parliament premises and inaugurate the ‘Prerna Sthal’ has not gone down well with the Opposition. The Congress has alleged that the government does not want the statues of Gandhi and Ambedkar in the traditional sites of democratic protests right next to where Parliament actually meets. Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar inaugurated the ‘Prerna Sthal’ on Sunday that will house all statues of the freedom fighters and other leaders that were earlier placed at different places in the Parliament complex. Dhankar stated that the ‘Prerna Sthal’ aims to inspire and motivate people. “Imagine the contribution of these great personalities in the history of India. In which period were these great people remembered? I saw such a situation in the Central Hall. I became an MP in 1989, after that the change happened continuously,” he said. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge has called the government’s relocation move “arbitrary and unilateral”. “My statement on relocation of statues of major leaders in the Parliament House Complex – The statues of many great leaders, including Mahatma Gandhi and Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, have been removed from their prominent places in the Parliament House Complex and relocated to a separate corner. Removing these statues arbitrarily, without any consultation, violates the basic spirit of our democracy. There are about 50 such statues or busts throughout the entire Parliament House,” Kharge wrote on X. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said the purpose behind the relocation and its grandiose naming was to ensure the statues of Mahatma Gandhi and Ambedkar were not placed conspicuously in front of Parliament House, where MPs could hold peaceful democratic protests as needed. The government, however, said the relocation of the statues was done as part of a landscaping and beautification exercise. Different stakeholders were consulted before relocating the statues to another enclosure, it added. “None of the statues have been removed, they have been relocated. There is no need to indulge in politics on this,” Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said. “From time to time, I have been discussing these issues with different stakeholders. People were of the view that having these statues at one place will help disseminate information about their lives and achievements in a better way,” he added. Vice-President Dhankar, who inaugurated the ‘Prerna Sthal’, said the new enclosure will be opened for visitors throughout the year and host commemoration days to honour the contribution of the leaders to nation building. The Lok Sabha Speaker said lawns and gardens have been laid around the statues at the Prerna Sthal to allow visitors to easily pay their tributes to them and also take inspiration from their lives by accessing information using QR codes. Many lawmakers over the years had staged protests near the Gandhi and Ambedkar statues. In the last 10 years, many sit-in demonstrations were organised near the Gandhi statue while Opposition leaders had also gathered near the Ambedkar statue to celebrate the Constitution Day. A 4.9-metre-tall bronze statue of Mahatma Gandhi, sculpted by renowned artist Ram V Sutar, was inaugurated in 1993. In 2005, several members of the ruling party protested at the venue over the frequent parliamentary disruptions by the opposition. After the Lok Sabha Secretariat issued a bulletin barring MPs from using the premises of Parliament for holding any demonstrations or protests or religious ceremonies, Mahua Moitra, Trinamool Congress MP, in 2022 proposed that the statue itself be removed from the precincts of the Parliament House. On the birthdays and memorial days of BR Ambedkar, thousands pay their respects to his statue inside the Parliament complex. Previously, outer lawns of Parliament housed statues of various national icons such as Ambedkar, Mahatma Gandhi, Jyotiba Phule, Chhatrapati Shivaji, Maharana Pratap, Hemu Kalani, Mahatma Basaveshwara, Kittur Rani Channamma, Motilal Nehru, Maharaj Ranjit Singh, Durga Malla, Birsa Munda, Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj and Chaudhary Devi Lal. These statues have now been relocated to Prerna Sthal."

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk Edited By: Shilpy Bisht News18.com Last Updated: June 17, 2024, 15:40 IST New Delhi, India An IndiGo flight landed on runway 27 of the Mumbai Airport while an Air India flight was still in the process of taking off for Thiruvananthapuram. (Image: @karanbhanushaliii/X) Passengers of Air India and IndiGo flights at the Mumbai airport had a near-miss experience when both the aircraft came dangerously close to each other, raising questions of safety margins and who was responsible for this situation – the pilots or Air Traffic Control (ATC). The Airbus A320neo aircraft — IndiGo flight 5053 from Indore to Mumbai and an Air India flight 657 from Mumbai to Thiruvananthapuram were involved in the incident. The incident took place within 90 seconds when an Iraqi flight took off and an AI flight entered the runway for take-off. The IndiGo flight landed on runway 27 while the Air India flight was still in the process of taking off for Thiruvananthapuram. The footage of the incident was widely on social media. It appeared that the Air India flight was accelerating down the runway as the IndiGo flight descended towards the ground. As the A320neo got closer, the Air India flight managed to get airborne, likely unaware of the other aircraft approaching from behind. It was able to take off without incident. It seems the IndiGo pilots erred because once they had spotted an aircraft on the runway, they should have aborted the landing and initiated a go-around. The incident occurred in clear weather. Pilots can hear each other communicate with the controller on the radio communications channel, as per a report by The Times of India . As per the rules, the Air India pilot should have informed the Air Traffic Control (ATC) about the delay in taking-off, which would have led to the cancellation of his take-off clearance. But the AI pilots continued with the slow take-off while the IndiGo pilots were approaching for landing. The Airport Authority of India (AAI) issued a circular stating that the preliminary investigation reveals violation of the standard operating procedure for ‘Time-Based Spacing’ between arrivals. “If the controller observes a delay in aircraft commencing take-off run after issuance of take-off clearance, the take-off clearance will be cancelled and the aircraft shall be instructed to vacate the runway immediately,” as per the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). Since the Air India flight took longer for its take-off, the controller should have cancelled its take-off permission while asking the IndiGo aircraft to go around. The Mumbai Airport is the second busiest airport in India in terms of total and international passenger traffic after Delhi, and it was the ninth busiest airport in Asia and the 25th busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic in fiscal year 2023-24. The Mumbai airport handles over 850 flights per day, or around 46 arrivals and departures per hour at peak time. In the period April 2023-March 2024, it saw 52,820,754 passengers, up 20.2% from the year before. It involved 324,986 aircraft movements, up 11.9%. It processed 822,963 tonnes of cargo. With the increasing density of traffic and the support of technology, the ATCs are evolving means to cut the time gap between departures and arrivals. The peak-hour declared capacity of main runway 27 is 46 aircraft movements. But the Mumbai ATC ends up handling close to 55 flight arrival and departures in 60 minutes as flight that are delayed or arrive early encroach into other flights’ slots, as per a report by The Times of India . Delhi and Bengaluru and other major airports in the world are served by parallel runways, which allow for two runways to be used simultaneously. The deadliest, and the world’s worst airliner crash, occurred on March 27, 1977, at Tenerife when two Boeing 747 passenger jets collided on the runway. The collision occurred when KLM Flight 4805 initiated its takeoff run during dense fog while Pan Am Flight 1736 was still on the runway. The impact and resulting fire killed all 248 people on board the KLM plane and 335 of the 396 people on board the Pan Am plane, with only 61 survivors in the front section of the aircraft. With a total of 583 fatalities, the disaster is the deadliest accident in aviation history. Air India Express Flight 812 landed beyond the normal touch-down point, overshot, and crashed across a cliff at Mangalore on May 22, 2010. This deadly aviation disaster in India resulted in 158 fatalities. On January 2, Japan Airlines Flight 516, an Airbus A350-900 operating from New Chitose Airport to Haneda Airport, collided with an earthquake relief plane, the Japan Coast Guard De Havilland Canada DHC-8-315Q, while landing. The A350 plane burst into flames after the collision as the airliner skidded on the blazing runway. Both aircraft were destroyed. Fire crews spent hours dousing the fire. Yet, all 379 passengers and crew on board were evacuated. This was the first hull loss for an Airbus A350. Five of the six crew members on the coast guard plane unfortunately died, and the captain was injured."

Following the Canadian model, we are focusing on an unbureaucratic, comprehensible and digital solution that companies and associations in Germany have long wanted,” said Misbah Khan, a member of the German parliament from the Green party, in a statement. • Applicants must have finished at least two years of vocational training or hold a relevant university degree from their home country. • Proficiency in either German or English is a prerequisite. • Additionally, candidates must demonstrate adequate financial resources, including income from a part-time job, to sustain themselves in Germany for a year, amounting to over 12,000 Euros. • Those who are over 40 years are at a disadvantage as the Opportunity Card is targeted more at a younger professional profile. A prospective candidate must acquire at least six points to qualify for the Opportunity Card. What are the Benefits? • The residence permit has been extended to 24 months for first-time recipients. Previously, it was granted for 18 months for completing adaptation measures. • This permit can be further extended for an additional 12 months, with a maximum residency period of three years. • Moreover, the allowance for secondary employment during the qualification process has been increased from 10 to 20 hours per week, facilitating easier access for aspiring skilled workers into the job market. The job search period can be extended by another two years (only once), depending on exceptional circumstances. • Individuals whose qualifications require a skills analysis to determine equivalence may receive a residence permit for up to six months to complete this evaluation. • Applicants seeking this pathway must demonstrate proficiency in the German language at level A2 or higher (CEFR). According to German Labour Minister Hubertus Heil, Germany would need 7 million skilled workers by 2035, with sectors such as nursing, the food and beverage industry, and IT experiencing the maximum shortage. As of April 2024, the Federal Employment Agency reported 7,01,000 vacant jobs. Germany has been an attractive destination for Indian professionals. In 2022, Germany granted the most work visas to Indians, with 17,379 approved visas. In February 2023, when German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited India, he stressed the need to simplify the visa process for Indian professionals, especially in the IT sector. Germany is currently undergoing technical recession, with its economic output shrunk by 0.3% in the last quarter of 2023. According to Bundesbank (German central bank) economic forecast, real gross domestic product (GDP) will rise by a calendar-adjusted 0.3% this year, with the Bank’s experts anticipating economic growth of 1.1% next year and 1.4% in 2026. However, employment growth is still expected to be slow. “Employment growth is expected to weaken slightly as supply bottlenecks increase, coming to a halt in the course of 2026. This is because the slight decline in unemployment in 2025 and 2026 will no longer open up any substantial scope for additional employment,” noted the report."

(Photo: PTI) Nearly 15 people died in the Kanchenjunga Express collision on Monday, when a container freight train rammed it near West Bengal’s New Jalpaiguri, making it one of the deadliest train tragedies. The Sealdah-bound Kanchanjungha Express collided with a goods train on Monday morning near New Jalpaiguri, a senior North Frontier Railway (NFR) official said. Preliminary investigation into the accident reveals that the loco pilot of the goods train disregarded the signal, which led to the mishap. The loco pilot of the goods train and the guard of the passenger train are among those killed in the accident. Around 19 trains have been cancelled so far on the New Jalpaiguri, Siliguri Junction, Bagdogra and Aluabari Road routes in the wake of the accident. India has witnessed a series of train accidents in the last 10 years due to technical failures and human negligence. Here are some of the major train accidents that occurred in a decade. Gorakhdham Express in 2014: The locomotive of Gorakhdham Express on the Hisar-Gorakhpur route derailed along with 11 coaches in Uttar Pradesh. The cause of the accident was deemed to be a “fracture of tongue rail”, which helps trains smoothly switch their path to another railway line, and it was classified as “Failure of Equipment”. Janata Express in 2015: The Varanasi-Dehradun Janata Express failed to stop at a station in Uttar Pradesh, leading to a crash and derailment of some coaches on March 20, 2015. “While the train was entering Bachhrawan station, the loco pilot of the train overshot the signal and crashed into the sand hump, causing derailment of the train engine and two coaches,” a Railways spokesperson had then said. A later inquiry said braking failure resulted in the accident. Indore-Patna Express in 2016: Fourteen coaches of the Indore-Patna Express derailed in the Pukhrayan area of the Kanpur Dehat district on November 20, 2016. The accident claimed 152 lives – one of the biggest death tolls for railway accidents in recent years. The NIA attributed the accident to terrorist sabotage. Then Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said there was “possible criminal interference by outsiders”. However, in 2020, the final CRS report cited a sudden catastrophic mechanical failure as the “probable cause”. Hirakhand Express in 2017: The Jagdalpur-Bhubaneswar Hirakhand Express derailed at the Kuneru station in Andhra Pradesh on January 21, 2017. The train’s mishap led to the deaths of 40 people and injuries to more than 50. In July 2017, a theory that the Maoists had planted explosives to derail the train was ruled out. The final reports of the accident have not been released so far in the Indore-Patna Express and Hirakhand Express cases. Jalandhar-Amritsar DMU, Amritsar-Howrah Express in 2018: During Dussehra, nearly 60 people were mowed down by two trains on the railway tracks near Amritsar on October 19, 2018. The crowd of 300 people had gathered to watch the fireworks during the Dussehra celebrations when the Jalandhar-Amritsar DMU came on the tracks. Former CM Captain Amarinder Singh ordered an inquiry. Several factors – the people, Municipal Corporation of Amritsar, politicians, police and railways were blamed for the mishap. Then Minister of State Manoj Sinha said in response to a question in the Lok Sabha: “According to the CCRS preliminary enquiry report, the incident occurred due to negligence of persons reportedly standing on and near railway track witnessing Dusshera Mela.” Seemanchal Express in 2019: A rail fracture led to the derailment of bogies of the Delhi-bound Seemanchal Express in Bihar’s Vaishali district on February 3, 2019. Several people died and others injured in the incident. A fracture in the rail tracks can be caused due to fatigue, wear and tear, lack of proper maintenance, corrosion, etc. Freight Train Accident in 2020: An empty freight train running from Cherlapally Station near Hyderabad to the Panewadi Station in Nashik, accidentally mowed down 16 workers who were sleeping on the tracks on May 8, 2020. The loco pilot reportedly spotted the workers but failed to stop the train in time. The migrant workers from Madhya Pradesh were attempting to travel back home amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Bikaner-Guwahati Express in 2022: On January 13, 2022, 10 passengers were killed and more than 40 injured after 12 coaches of the Bikaner-Guwahati Express derailed in the Domohani area of West Bengal’s Jalpaiguri district. Shalimar-Chennai Coromandel Express in 2023: Three trains collided, leading to the deaths of at least 293 people on June 2, 2023. The accident occurred when the Chennai-bound Coromandel Express entered the loop line and rammed a stationary goods train in Balasore, Odisha. A few coaches of Yesvantpur Superfast Express derailed after crashing into the capsized coaches of the Coromandel Express on the adjacent track. Lucknow-Rameshwaram Bharat Gaurav Train Fire: A fire broke out in the Lucknow-Rameshwaram Bharat Gaurav train on August 25, 2023. Nine people died, and 20 passengers were injured. Preliminary investigations revealed that the fire was triggered by a gas cylinder which the passengers smuggled inside the coach for cooking. Bihar North East Express: On October 11, 2023, train number 12506 Anand Vihar Terminal-Kamakhya Junction North East Express derailed near Raghunathpur Railway Station in Buxar district of Bihar. Six coaches went off the tracks, causing four fatalities and injuring over 70 passengers. The derailment prompted an investigation into its causes, highlighting the urgent need for better maintenance and safety protocols on the railways. Andhra Pradesh Train Collision: Two passenger trains in Andhra Pradesh’s Vizianagaram district occurred on October 29, 2023. The Visakhapatnam-Palasa passenger train collided with the Visakhapatnam-Rayagada passenger train, leading to the death of 14 passengers. The accident was attributed to signal failure and human error, sparking debates about the modernisation of railway signalling systems."

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk Edited By: Shilpy Bisht News18.com Last Updated: June 18, 2024, 12:56 IST New Delhi, India According to railway officials, when TA 912 is issued, the loco pilot needs to approach the red signal at 10 kmph. The inquiry into the Kanchanjunga Express train accident in West Bengal on Monday points to human error and signal failure that led to a collision killing nine people and injuring 41. The locopilot of the goods train rammed into the rear of the Kanchanjunga Express between Rangapani and Chattar Hat railway stations of the Northeast Frontier Railway in West Bengal after being authorised to cross all red signals by Rangapani Station Master. The Railway Board’s initial report had revealed that the goods train, operating under a defective automatic signalling system, was travelling above speed limits when it crashed into the Kanchanjunga Express. “Automatic signalling has failed and you are hereby authorised to pass all automatic signals between RNI (Rangapani Railway Station) and CAT (Chattar Hat Junction),” document T/A 912 stated. When a signal failure in the automatic system occurs, the rules demand that the station master issue a written pass to the driver to cross the red signals. This written authority is called PLCT (paper line clear ticket) T/A 912. According to a source, T/A 912 had been issued to the driver of the express train. According to railway officials, when such a document (T/A 912) is given, the loco pilot needs to approach the red signal at 10 kmph, bring his train to a stop as close as possible to the rear of the signal, wait for 1 minute during day time and 2 minutes at night at the signal, and then proceed with extreme caution at speed not exceeding 15 kmph in good visibility conditions and 10 kmph in poor visibility. The locopilot should also ensure that a minimum distance of 150 metres or two clear OHE span is maintained between his train and the preceding train or any obstruction on the line, as per a report by The Times of India . The T/A 912 authority letter mentioned that the automatic signalling system had failed and authorised the driver to pass all automatic signals between Rangapani and Chattarhat, regardless of whether they were red or caution signals. The Chairman of Railway Board and Chief Executive Officer, Jaya Varma Sinha, claimed in an interview to a television channel that the goods train had “disregarded” the signal resulting in the accident. Documents, however, revealed that the Kanchanjunga Express was given a similar authority to pass all signals in danger. The train had come to a halt at signal (AS-650) when the rear end collision took place, according to a report by The Hindu . The Indian Railway Loco Runningmen Organisation (IRLRO) has expressed doubts about the railways’ claim that the driver disregarded the red light and strongly disagreed with attributing the disaster to a deceased loco pilot while an investigation is still being conducted. “Now, it is clear from the document that the loco pilot of the goods train was authorised to cross red signals because they were defective. This is the failure of the railway administration and not the fault of the driver,” the organisation’s working president Sanjay Pandhi said, according to The Indian Express . The collision occurred near Rangapani station, 30 km from New Jalpaiguri station, causing four rear compartments of Kanchanjunga Express to derail due to the impact by the goods train’s locomotive at 8.55 am, an official said. Passengers said the train was moving dead slow when the goods train rammed into it. Five containers from the goods train spilled over to the adjacent tracks. The accident was similar to the incident that happened last year in June near Balasore where a speeding Coromandel Express had collided with a stationary goods train, killing nearly 300 people. The Railway Board Chairman admitted that the railways’ ‘Kavach’ or anti-train collision system was not in place along the Guwahati-Delhi route where the accident took place."

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk Edited By: Shilpy Bisht News18.com Last Updated: June 18, 2024, 14:58 IST New Delhi, India Om Birla is the current Speaker and has held the post for the past five years. Reports suggest Birla will continue to be the Speaker. He won the Lok Sabha polls as a BJP candidate from Kota, Rajasthan. (Image: PTI) The election for the post of Lok Sabha Speaker is a crucial milestone that the BJP-led NDA government will overcome next. While the Opposition INDIA bloc leaders are demanding that the post be given to a TDP or JD(U) leader — both NDA allies — the BJP is keen to nominate one of its members. The BJP had enjoyed absolute majority with more than 300 seats in the last two Lok Sabha Elections. But this time, it had to rely on its allies, especially the JD(U) and TDP, to form the government at the Centre. Therefore, it is imperative for the BJP to ensure the coveted post goes to one of its people since the Speaker has the power to preside over the Lok Sabha sessions and decide the agenda. The BJP won 240 Lok Sabha seats, 32 short of the majority mark, in the Lok Sabha Elections 2024, the results of which were announced on June 4. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu’s Naidu’s TDP and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) won 16 and 12 seats respectively, emerging as key stake-holders in the new PM Modi-led government. The Speaker’s post falls vacant just before the new Lok Sabha session begins, in this case on June 24. According to Article 93 of the Constitution, the President appoints a Pro-tem Speaker to administer the oath of office to the newly elected Members of Parliament (MPs) on June 24-June 25. Before the election takes place, the pro-tem speaker will preside over the House for the first three days till the election. The general practice is to give temporary charge to the senior-most parliamentarian. The Lok Sabha Speaker is elected by a majority. More than 50% of the MPs have to vote for a particular candidate to become the Speaker. There is no fixed criterion for the appointment of the Speaker. After the election of the Lok Sabha Speaker on June 26, the prime minister is expected to introduce his Council of Ministers to the Lok Sabha. On June 27, the Rajya Sabha will also resume and President Droupadi Murmu will deliver a joint address to both the Houses of Parliament. The Speaker derives his power from the conduct of business in the House and the unwritten conventions. The Speaker is bestowed with the power of maintaining order and decorum. He is also the guardian of powers and privileges of the members, its House and committees. He has the power to decide which member can address Parliament or raise questions in the House. Most importantly, he can accept or reject a law that the government intends to pass as a Money Bill. A Money Bill is a legislation that deals with the matters related to taxes, government revenues and other financial issues. Aadhaar Act in 2016 was a Money Bill, which was introduced and debated in the Lok Sabha. When there is no quorum, the Speaker has the power to suspend or adjourn the proceedings of the House. He also has the power to disqualify any member of the House. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will propose the name of an NDA candidate for the post of the Speaker in the session, which is expected to backed by Union minister Rajnath Singh. At least five to six proposals are expected to be put forth for the candidacy by the NDA allies. In case, the Opposition fields its own candidate for the post, an election will take place. If this happens, it would be the first such instance in Independent India’s history as the presiding officer has always been chosen by a consensus, according to news agency PTI . At present, Om Birla is the current Lok Sabha Speaker, and has held the post for the past five years. Reports suggest Birla will continue to be the Speaker. He won the Lok Sabha polls as a BJP candidate from Kota, Rajasthan. Among the other names doing rounds is that of Daggubati Purandeswari. Daughter of TDP founder NT Rama Rao, Purandeswari is a BJP politician from Andhra Pradesh and also the state’s party president. Purandeswari won from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh by over 2.3 lakh votes this year. She has served as MoS in the Ministry of Human Resource Development in 2009. The post has been vacant for the past five years. The post of the Deputy Speaker is conventionally held by the member of the Opposition party. All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) MP M Thambidurai was the deputy speaker between 2014-19 when his party was a part of the ruling NDA. BJP’s Charanjit Singh Atwal was the Deputy Speaker in 2004, and MP Kariya Munda in 2009 during the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance’s (UPA) rule. While the NDA is pitching for a consensus candidate for the post of Speaker, the Opposition is asking for the post of Deputy Speaker citing convention. “We will force a contest for the post of Lok Sabha speaker if the government does not agree to have an opposition leader as deputy speaker,” a senior Congress leader said, as per PTI ."

(Photo: Getty) The latest Kerala Migration Survey report that was unveiled in the Loka Kerala Sabha in Thiruvananthapuram last week showed the number of emigrants to return home has gone up. The Kerala Migration Survey (KMS), 2023, conducted by the Gulati Institute of Finance Taxation (GIFT) with technical support from the International Institute of Migration and Development (IIMAD), also estimated the outward remittance from Kerala at Rs 43,378.6 crore, about 20% of the inward remittance. The survey is conducted every five years since 1998. It was conducted in the sample size of 20,000 households across 14 districts and 77 taluks of Kerala. • The number of emigrants from the state climbed to 2.2 million, close to the 2.1 million recorded in the previous migration survey held in 2018. • Kerala registered a marginal rise in student emigration compared to the previous survey in 2018. From 1,29,763 student emigrants in 2018, the number has doubled to about 2.5 lakh in 2023, around a 100% increase in the post-pandemic period. The survey noted a considerable increase in the number of emigrants leaving the state as early as 17 years. • There has also been notable shift in the preference of destination for student migration with the preference for non-GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries growing from 10.8% in 2018 to 19.5% in 2023. There has been a decline in the number of emigrants choosing GCC countries from 89.2% in 2018 to 80.5% in 2023. • The proportion of female emigration has also increased from 15.8% in 2018 to 19.1% in 2023. Female migration has further seen a shift from GCC countries to Europe and other Western nations as destination countries, accounting for 40.5%. In terms of education, 71.5% of female migrants were found to have completed degree-level education as opposed to only 34.7% of male emigrants. • Nine out of the 14 districts in Kerala observed a considerable decline in the number of emigrants when compared to 2018, indicating a saturation of international migration, the survey found. • North Kerala continues to dominate in the migration with Malappuram leading in the table with 3,77,647 emigrants in 2023. • In terms of religious distribution, Muslims account for 41.9% of total emigrants, followed by Hindus at 35.2% and Christians at 22.3%. • The global Malayali diaspora is estimated to be 5 million, whereas the Malayali diaspora outside Kerala, within India, is estimated at 3 million. Total remittances from migration also reached a record Rs 2,16,893 crore in 2023 from Rs 85,092 crore in 2018 – an increase of 154.9%. • The number of emigrants who have returned home is also estimated to be 1.8 million, a significant increase from 1.2 million in 2018. Most migrants are returning home due to Covid-19 pandemic-induced job loss. The survey showed around 18.4% of respondents reported job loss as a reason for return, 13.8% cited low wages, 7.5% poor working conditions, and 11.2% illness or accident. The desire to work in Kerala (16.1%), homesickness (10.2 %) and retirement (12.1%) were other key reasons. The increase in remittances showed average remittance per emigrant household also increased to Rs 2.24 lakh in 2023, compared to Rs 96,185 in 2018. The survey showed migrant households spend remittances on renovation of houses/shops (15.8%), paying of bank loans (14%), educational expenses 10%, and medical bills 7.7%. Only 6.9% of remittances are used for day-to-day expenditure. KV Joseph, director of the Thiruvananthapuram-based International Institute of Migration and Development (IIMD), said, as quoted by The New Indian Express, Gulf is no longer an attractive destination for young job seekers from Kerala. Immediately after the oil boom in the 1970s, a large number of unskilled and semi-skilled Keralites migrated to Gulf countries. Those who have settled down there in the 70s and 80s are returning since their children are either going to Europe, Canada or the US. Even construction sector that once employed a large number of migrant workers, especially during the oil boom of the 1970s, is at saturation. Young Arabs, who are educated and trained in American and European universities, are filling up top and mid-level positions in banking, IT, healthcare and hospitality sectors, leaving little space for the Indian immigrants to accommodate in."

(Photo: X) Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Bihar today to inaugurate a new campus at Nalanda University near Rajgir’s ancient university ruins. The campus is named after the ancient Nalanda University, which has attracted hundreds of scholars from around the world about 1,600 years ago. External Affairs minister S Jaishankar and ambassadors from 17 partner countries, including representatives from ASEAN nations, will attend the event. Bihar governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar and chief minister Nitish Kumar will join the Prime Minister. The university’s interim vice-chancellor, professor Abhay Kumar Singh, said, as quoted by The Hindu, “We consider the visit of the Prime Minister a very prestigious and auspicious occasion. The Prime Minister has made the occasion special because he is bringing the diplomats of East Asia Summit countries. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is also coming. This celebratory spirit will give Nalanda a boost.” The university has been a home to thousands of scholars and the world’s first residential university more than 1,500 years ago in the ancient kingdom of Magadha (present-day Bihar). During its heyday, Nalanda was located near the city of Rajagriha or the present-day Rajgir, not too far away from Pataliputra or the present-day Patna. It was founded in the 5th century CE and became one of the most renowned universities in the world. It had an impressive staff of 2,000 teachers and 10,000 students from far-flung regions such as China, Korea, Japan, Tibet, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia. Chinese monk Xuan Zang has offered invaluable insights into the academic and architectural grandeur of ancient Nalanda. Though the exact age of the university is still not known to the historians, but it did reach its peak of fame during the reign of Pala dynasty in the 8th and 9th centuries CE. It was during this era that the university saw international exposure. Subjects such as medicine, ancient Indian medical system Ayurveda, religion, Buddhism, mathematics, grammar, astronomy and Indian philosophy were taught there. However, Nalanda’s most enduring legacy lies in its monumental contributions to mathematics and astronomy. Did you know Aryabhata, the father of Indian mathematics who invented zero, used to teach at Nalanda in the 6th century CE? The admission into the university was as tough as getting into today’s elite colleges or Ivy League. Students underwent rigorous oral interviews with the university’s top professors. Those who passed were tutored by an eclectic group of scholars under revered Buddhist masters such as Dharmapala and Silabhadra. The university’s library, ‘Dharma Gunj’, or the ‘Mountain of Truth’, was a treasure trove of nine million handwritten palm-leaf manuscripts and the world’s richest repository of Buddhist knowledge. In the 1190s, the institution was set afire by Bakhtiyar Khilji, a Turko-Afghan military general. The campus blaze reportedly raged for three months, reducing to ashes what was arguably the richest repository of Buddhist wisdom. The few manuscripts, which survived the destruction, are now safeguarded in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Yarlung Museum in Tibet. After six centuries, the university was rediscovered in 1812 by Scottish surveyor Francis Buchanan-Hamilton and later identified as the ancient university by Sir Alexander Cunningham in 1861. In 2006, former president Dr APJ Abdul Kalam proposed the re-establishment of the university during a session of the Bihar State Legislative Assembly. The idea found strong support, leading to the passing of the Nalanda University Bill in 2010. In 2014, the new university began operating from a temporary location with just 14 students. The temporary location at the International Convention Centre in Rajgir, 10 km from ancient Nalanda, was inaugurated in September 2014 by the then-external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj. Former president Pranab Mukherjee laid the foundation stone for the permanent campus in Pilkhi village in Rajgir in 2016. Construction on the new campus started in 2017. The new campus merges eco-friendly architecture with ancient Vaastu principles, creating a net-zero carbon footprint campus spread over 100 acres. A 1.2-MW AC biogas-based waste-to-energy plant is in the last phase of completion. It features two academic blocks with 40 classrooms accommodating nearly 1,900 students, two administrative blocks, two auditoriums with a combined seating capacity of over 300, and hostels housing up to 550 students. The residential area includes 197 academic housing units, ensuring comfort and convenience for faculty and students alike. The new campus also has a guesthouse, an international centre, a dining hall with a capacity of 1,000, an Amphitheatre that can accommodate up to 2,000, and essential amenities such as a sports complex, a medical centre, a commercial centre, and a faculty club. A library with a capacity to hold 300,000 books and 3,000 users is scheduled for completion in September. The university has six schools – the school of Buddhist studies, philosophy and comparative religions, the school of historical studies, the school of ecology and environmental studies, the school of sustainable development and management, the school of languages and literature, and the school of international relations and peace studies, which is yet to commence. It also has four centres – the Center for Bay of Bengal Studies, Center for Indo-Persian Studies, Centre for Conflict Resolution and Peace Studies, and a Common Archival Resource Center. The university currently offers postgraduate and doctoral research courses, short-term certificate courses, and 137 scholarships for international students."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Himani Chandna Edited By: Shilpy Bisht News18.com Last Updated: June 19, 2024, 11:00 IST New Delhi, India While there are many causes behind SNHL, doctors said in some rare cases, the condition can develop suddenly and without a clear cause, as appears to be the case with Alka Yagnik. Veteran singer Alka Yagnik disclosed on her Instagram post on Monday that she has been diagnosed with a “rare sensory hearing loss” after a viral infection. She wrote, “A few weeks ago, as I walked out of a flight, I suddenly felt I was not able to hear anything”. According to experts, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) happens because of damage to the inner ear or the nerve that carries sound to the brain called the auditory nerve. Simply put, this type of hearing loss is caused by viruses directly attacking the hearing nerves, leading to inflammation. This type of hearing loss can impact the ability to hear both soft and loud sounds, and it can also distort sounds, making speech and other noises seem unclear. The most common symptom is hearing loss in one ear, though it can occasionally affect both ears. Other symptoms include tinnitus (a buzzing sound in the ear), a feeling of fullness in the ear, and dizziness. Meanwhile, doctors have noted an increase in cases of SNHL due to unknown reasons. “Recently, an increase in SNHL cases has been observed without a specific underlying cause identified,” Dr Manohar Shaan, head of the ENT department, at Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital in Mumbai, told News18. He said viral infections can cause SNHL by directly attacking the inner ear, damaging the immune system, or cutting off blood supply to the inner ear. Knowing the causes and risk factors are important to prevent and manage SNHL early, he cautioned patients. “It is influenced by the natural process of aging. Usually patients with SNHL report lack of clarity in understanding speech, or to differentiate words. It may also be accompanied with tinnitus,” said Dr Aparna Mahajan, Consultant, ENT, Amrita Hospital Faridabad. “Sensorineural hearing loss cannot be cured, though it can be managed in ways that can address its symptoms and improve your quality of life.” Experts believe the causes of SNHL can be different, from genetic factors to ageing, prolonged noise exposure, ototoxic medications, viral infections, head trauma and some other disorders. “This condition is different from temporary hearing changes after deboarding an airplane, which is caused by barotrauma, resulting from rapid air pressure changes affecting the eustachian tube’s ability to equalise pressure in the middle ear,” Dr Shaan explained. Generally, noise-induced hearing loss arises from extended exposure to loud sounds, and certain medicines are toxic to inner ear structures. Also, viral infections, such as measles and mumps, can inflame and damage the inner ear or auditory nerve. “The most common symptoms are a gradual or sudden decrease in hearing, difficulty understanding speech, tinnitus, and trouble hearing high-pitched sounds,” Shaan said. Dr Atri Banerjee from the ENT department at Narayana Health RN Tagore Hospital, Mukundapur, West Bengal, pointed out that unlike conductive hearing loss, which is often caused by blockages or damage to the outer or middle ear, SNHL typically involves problems in the auditory nerve or the hair cells in the cochlea. “These hair cells are essential for converting sound vibrations into electrical signals that the brain can interpret as sound. When these cells are damaged or die, the ability to hear can be significantly impaired.” While there are many causes behind the SNHL condition, Banerjee said “in some rare cases, the condition can develop suddenly and without a clear cause, as appears to be the case with Yagnik.” Dr Neha Sethi, senior consultant, ENT at Dharamshila Narayana Hospital Delhi, explained that “unlike conductive hearing loss that might be treated medically or surgically, SNHL is often irreversible.” “Management usually involves the use of hearing aids that amplify sound or cochlear implants for more severe cases, which electronically stimulate the cochlear nerve.” Sethi said that “for a playback singer like Alka Yagnik, whose career is deeply tied to auditory precision, this diagnosis can be particularly challenging.” According to Hyderabad-based neurologist Dr Sudhir Kumar, one must try to avoid exposure to viral infection and take the annual flu vaccine. He also suggests avoiding exposure to loud noise and the use of headphones or earphones for a long duration, especially at high volumes. “Many patients recover on their own in the first few days. Patients who receive early treatment with steroids also recover well. A few patients are, however, left with permanent or long-term hearing loss,” Kumar from Apollo Hospital said."

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk Edited By: Shilpy Bisht News18.com Last Updated: June 19, 2024, 13:39 IST New Delhi, India Policyholders to get a refund of the premium or proportionate premium for the unexpired policy period if he chooses to cancel his/her policy at any time during the policy term. A life insurance policyholder who wants a seamless exit payout can now get one as the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has introduced provisions that provide higher surrender value. At present, the policyholders don’t get any sum or receive less payout if they discontinue their premiums. The regulatory authority has ensured that the insurance company establishes “reasonableness” for existing and continuing policyholders. Insurers will now be liable to pay the special surrender value if the exit takes place after completing one year. No exit payouts were given until now in the first year. This provision can be utilised if the policyholder has already paid the premium for the first year. IRDAI has specified that Special Surrender Value must be at least equal to the expected present value of future benefits (accruing from the paid-up capital), paid-up sum assured on all contingencies and accrued or vested benefits provided in the policy (such as survival benefits). For non-linked pension products, assured benefits should be disbursed upon vesting, except in the case of linked pension products where the payment of defined assured benefits upon vesting is discretionary. IRDAI has clarified that pension products provided to individual customers must offer specific assured benefits, which may be disbursed in the event of death or any covered health contingency. A policyholder with multiple health insurance policies gets to choose the policy under which he/she can get the admissible claim amount. In the event of no claims during the policy period, the insurers may reward the policyholders by providing an option to choose a No Claim Bonus, either by increasing the sum insured or discounting the premium amount. Policyholders to get a refund of the premium or proportionate premium for the unexpired policy period if he chooses to cancel his/her policy at any time during the policy term. If a policyholder stops paying premiums after a certain period, the policy continues to exist albeit with a lower sum assured. This is referred to as paid-up value. The guaranteed surrender value (GSV) under the revised regulations for other than single premium products is 30% if the policy is surrendered in the second year, 35% in the third year, 50% between four years and seven years, and 90% during the last two years. For single premium products, the GSV will be 75% if surrendered within three years and 90% if surrendered in the last two years of the policy tenure. The regulatory authority wants to both safeguard and avert mis-selling. It has asked insurers in its annual report to identify major causes of lapses. These regulations seek to streamline the operations of entities engaged in reinsurance operations, IRDAI said. By promoting transparency and stability, these regulations aim to create a conducive environment for the growth and expansion of the reinsurance sector, ultimately benefiting both insurers and policyholders in India. Newly introduced measures such as the processing of cashless authorisation requests within one hour, the freedom to choose treatment of choice, including Ayush-certified therapies, and the choice of adjusting the No Claim Bonus by discounting future premiums or increasing the sum assured are an advantage for the existing policyholders, as per the report by The Hindu Businessline . In 2022-23, the insurance industry recorded a premium income of Rs 7.83 lakh crore – about 13% growth YoY. The private sector’s premium grew 16.3% while that of public sector insurers rose 10.9%. The IRDAI said the regulations aim to promote prudent practices in risk management related to outsourcing activities by insurers."

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk Edited By: Shilpy Bisht News18.com Last Updated: June 19, 2024, 17:21 IST New Delhi, India Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un talk to each other during their meeting in Pyongyang, North Korea, on Wednesday, June 19. (AP Photo) Russian President Vladimir Putin met his “comrade” Kim Jong Un in North Korea’s capital Pyongyang on Wednesday in a rare visit to the state in 24 years amid the Ukraine war. State-controlled North Korean news agency KCNA said Kim “could not contain his joy” at what it described as a “touching reunion”. Both the leaders, whose countries face escalating standoffs with west, have signed a mutual partnership that includes a vow to aid if either country is attacked. North Korea is under heavy UN Security Council sanctions over its weapons programme, while Russia also faces sanctions by the US and its Western partners over its aggression in Ukraine. There are growing concerns that an arms arrangement has been made between the two countries in which North Korea provides Russia with munitions for its war in Ukraine in exchange of economic assistance and technology transfers to Pyongyang. The “comprehensive strategic partnership” does not clarify the kind of assistance that both the countries have signed up for. The West has accused North Korea of circumventing international sanctions to transfer arms and missiles to Russia but Pyongyang has denied any such handover. Russia is likely providing North Korea with food, fuel and military technology for its satellites and submarines, according to analysts quoted by CNBC . Experts say Kim’s wishlist includes technologies related to advanced telemetry, nuclear-powered submarines, military satellites, and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Russian technology likely contributed to Pyongyang’s first successful military spy satellite launch in November 2023 — just two months after the last Putin-Kim summit. Kim said Moscow and Pyongyang’s “fiery friendship” is now even closer than during Soviet times, and promised “full support and solidarity to the Russian government, army and people in carrying out the special military operation in Ukraine to protect sovereignty, security interests and territorial integrity,” as quoted by news agency The Associated Press . North Korea may also seek to increase labour exports to Russia and other illicit activities to gain foreign currency in defiance of UN Security Council sanctions, according to a recent report by the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank run by South Korea’s main spy agency. There will likely be talks about expanding cooperation in agriculture, fisheries and mining and promoting Russian tourism to North Korea, the institute said. Since the war began in Ukraine in February 2022, Russia’s isolation by the West has increased, and Putin has been seeking partners and customers in the East for its oil and commodities. Russia’s military, which has been placed on a war-footing, is facing a shortfall of what it can produce monthly and how much is being spent on it on the battlefield in Ukraine. Putin needs Kim’s weapons to make up for a monthly munition shortfall of 50,000 rounds, even if Russia is producing ammunition at full capacity in the pursuit of victory in Ukraine, per the Center for Strategic and International Studies. According to a US statement in February, Russia has received more than 10,000 shipping containers – the equivalent of 260,000 metric tonnes of munitions or munitions-related material – from North Korea since September. Russian forces have also launched at least 10 North Korea-made missiles on Ukraine since September, a US official said, quoted by CNN . Putin also sees the relationship with Kim as a way to raise the specter of nuclear war, exploiting “US and South Korean concerns about North Korea” so that the Ukraine allies will be compelled to negotiate on Russia’s terms, analysts believe. Observers also believe that Putin is unlikely at this point to directly help North Korea’s nuclear programme, as neither Putin nor his close partner Xi want to see nuclear confrontation in the region, a CNN report mentioned. In March, a Russian veto at the United Nations ended monitoring of UN sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear programme, prompting Western accusations that Moscow is seeking to avoid scrutiny as it buys weapons from Pyongyang for use in Ukraine. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has called Putin’s visit to North Korea “in desperation, to develop and to strengthen relations with countries that can provide it with what it needs to continue the war of aggression that it started against Ukraine.” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters, “We’re not concerned about the trip. What we are concerned about is the deepening relationship between these two countries.” Kirby said this concern was “not just because of the impact it’s going to have on the Ukrainian people, because we know North Korean ballistic missiles are still being used to hit Ukrainian targets, but because there could be some reciprocity here that could affect security on the Korean peninsula.” Washington has an opportunity to exert strategic influence by working with like-minded South Korea and Japan against the Kim, Putin and Xi Jinping who are united in opposition to the US and the Western liberal order. Meanwhile, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Lin Jian said at a briefing that the summit was a bilateral exchange between Russia and North Korea but did not elaborate. “China has certain reservations regarding North Korea’s deepening military cooperation with Russia, which could undermine Beijing’s near monopoly of geopolitical influence over Pyongyang,” said Tong Zhao of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, as quoted by Reuters . China proclaimed a “no limits” relationship with Russia just days before Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but Beijing has so far avoided providing weapons and ammunition for the war effort. South Korea, where senior Chinese foreign and defence officials’ visit coincide with Putin’s visit to North Korea, said, “Our side expressed concern about Russian President Putin’s visit to North Korea scheduled on the same day, and China expressed hope that exchanges between Russia and North Korea would contribute to peace and stability in the region.” China would become concerned if North Korea’s partnership with Russia leads to provocative behaviour that makes the regional situation more difficult for Beijing as it wants to rebuild its economy and do trade, said Niklas Swanstrom, Director of the Institute for Security and Development Policy in Sweden, as mentioned by Reuters ."

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk Edited By: Shilpy Bisht News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 10:42 IST New Delhi, India Madhuri was driving a BMW on Monday night. She allegedly ran over Surya who was in an inebriated state. Her father, Beeda Masthan Rao, is a Rajya Sabha MP (Left). The daughter of a Rajya Sabha MP Beeda Masthan Rao, Beeda Madhuri, who allegedly ran over a 22-year-old man sleeping on the pavement near Beasant Nagar in Chennai, was released on bail within 24 hours of the incident. The police have identified the deceased as Surya, a painter who stayed in Odaikuppam near Besant Nagar. The incident comes just a month after the high-profile Porsche accident in Pune in which a teenaged son of a builder allegedly mowed down two software engineers from Madhya Pradesh. The case caused a hue and cry after the boy, who was driving the Porsche car in an inebriated state, was let off by a magistrate within 15 hours of arrest on a condition that he will write an essay on the crime. Madhuri was driving a BMW on Monday night. She was accompanied by her friend, another woman, allegedly ran over Surya who was in an inebriated state. According to the police, Surya had an argument with his wife Vanitha on Monday. After consuming alcohol, he slept on the pavement near Varadaraj Salai, about 2 km away from his home. His wife concerned for his safety, went searching for him and found him on the pavement. As per eyewitnesses and Vanitha, the car stopped briefly after the accident. The two women allegedly stepped out of the vehicle to assess the situation, alerted an ambulance and left the scene as a crowd gathered. Madhuri reportedly fled from the accident spot immediately but her friend got out of the vehicle and was arguing with bystanders after the mishap. Passers-by rushed Surya to the Government Royapettah Hospital nearby but he was declared brought dead. Madhuri surrendered before the police on Tuesday morning. She was arrested on charges of causing death due to negligence, a violation of Section 304A of the Indian Penal Code, but was released on station bail shortly thereafter. The police checked the CCTV footage and found that the BMW belonged to the BMR (Beeda Masthan Rao) Group and was registered in Puducherry. According to them, Surya got married eight months ago, and was striving to make a living through painting and doing odd jobs. Madhuri belongs to an affluent family. Her father Beeda Masthan Rao was elected as a Rajya Sabha MP in 2022. He served as an MLA before. Rao quit the Telugu Desam Party and joined the YSR Congress in December 2019. He is a backward-class leader belonging to the Yadava community. He is currently a member of the committee on agriculture, animal husbandry and food processing and committee for the ministry of commerce and industry, states his company website. Madhuri is the director of the BMR Group. Rao’s net worth is Rs 243 crore, with movable assets worth Rs 153 crore, and immovable assets at Rs 93 crore, according to his election affidavit. In 2014, the BMR Group of Industries was awarded the Best Hatchery award and also the largest supplier of shrimp seed in the country by MPEDA. Section 106 (2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 (BNS) stipulates imprisonment of up to 10 years and a fine for fleeing an accident spot and failing to report the incident to a police officer or a magistrate. This is in addition to the Indian Penal Code’s Section 304A under which the accused faces penalties of up to two years in jail upon identification. The BNS, which will be effective from July 1, has two distinct categories for “causing death by negligence”. The first category addresses causing death through any rash or negligent act that does not amount to culpable homicide. Offenders in this category may face imprisonment for up to five years and a fine. The second category deals with causing death through rash and negligent driving, not amounting to culpable homicide. If the individual flees without reporting the incident to a police officer or magistrate, they could face up to 10 years of imprisonment and a fine. In 2022, India registered the highest count of road crash fatalities, exceeding 1.68 lakh deaths. This roughly translates to an average of 462 deaths daily. The world saw a 5% decrease in road crash deaths, while India witnessed a year-on-year increase of 12% in road accidents and 9.4% in fatalities in the same year. An average of 19 deaths occur due to road accidents every hour in India, which amounts to nearly one death every three and a half minutes, as per a report in The Hindu. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 47,806 hit-and-run incidents were reported in 2022, in which 50,815 people died. As per data from the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, the share of such cases in road accidents and deaths was 14.6% and 18.1% in 2022 and 16.8% and 11.8% in 2021. This means most of the hit-and-run cases were reported in the State Highways, and other district and village roads which are maintained by the local bodies. In 2022, the conviction rate was 47.9% while in other forms of accidents, it was just 21.8%. This is higher than the conviction rate in murder and culpable homicide not amounting to murder at 43.8% and 38.7%, respectively. Charge sheets were filed in 66.4% of hit-and-run cases in 2022, vis-a vis 81.5% in murder cases, 84% of culpable homicide and 79.6% of other accidents. The major reason behind failure to file a charge sheet in these cases is inability on the part of the police to get enough proof. Such cases accounted for 28% of hit-and-run cases in 2022 compared to 11% in murder cases, 9% of culpable homicide cases, and 11% of other accidents."

(Image: PTI File) In India, marks and degrees decide the future of an individual. But if national-level exams are mired in controversies, what does it say about the integrity and faith in the testing systems? The controversy around the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) results and cancellation of the UGC-NET June 2024 exams not only puts the spotlight on the biggest riskers – the candidates – who devote their time, money and mind to prepare for such prestigious examinations, only to be to be declared void later, but also on the need for a system that ensures fairness and authenticity. A hue and cry over NEET results began earlier this month after 64 candidates received the perfect 720 score, nearly 1,500 were awarded “grace marks” to compensate for the loss time while appearing for the exam and some of them alleged paper leak. The Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Bill, 2024 was passed in February to ensure that exams in the country are conducted fair in order to bring credibility to the public examination system. It contains a total of 19 Sections divided into VI Chapters to comprehensively address all of the issues pertaining to the prevention of unfair means in the public examination. It deals with issues such as unfair means ranging from leakage of the question paper, accessing or taking possession of question paper or an Optical Mark Recognition response sheet without authority, direct or indirect assistance to any candidate such as providing solution to one or more questions by unauthorised person, violation of security measures, tampering with the computer systems and conduct of fake examination, issuance of fake admit cards or offer letters to cheat or for monetary gain. A “public examination” is defined as any examination conducted by a “public examination authority” listed in the Schedule of the Bill, or any “such other authority as may be notified by the Central Government” under Section 2(k). The five public examination authorities under the bill are: (i) the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), which conducts the Civil Services Examination, Combined Defence Services Examinations, Combined Medical Services Examination, Engineering Services Examination; (ii) the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), which recruits for Group C (non-technical) and Group B (non-gazetted) jobs in the central government; (iii) the Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs), which recruit Groups C and D staff in the Indian Railways; (iv) the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS), which hires at all levels for nationalised banks and regional rural banks (RRBs); and (v) National Testing Agency (NTA), which conducts the JEE (Main), NEET-UG, UGC-NET, the Common University Entrance Test (CUET). Besides these, all ministries and departments of the Central government and their attached subordinate offices for recruitment of staff also come under the purview of the Public Examinations Bill. According to the Section 9 of the Bill, all offences are cognizable, non-bailable and non-compoundable, that is, an arrest can be made without a warrant and bail will not be a matter of right rather a magistrate will determine whether the accused can be released on bail. “Any person or persons resorting to unfair means and offences” will land up in prison for three to five years, and will face a fine up to Rs 10 lakh. If the convict fails to pay the fine, “an additional punishment of imprisonment shall be imposed, as per the provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023,” Section 10(1) of the Bill says. The Section 10(2) of the Bill recognises the responsibility of a service provider, who is engaged to provide “support of any computer resource or any material, by whatever name it may be called”. The punishment ranges from 3 to 10 years in prison along with a fine of Rs 1 crore. It further provides for a four-year ban for the service provider from conducting public examination, which is a concrete measure towards fixing their liability. The Bill provides for harsher punishment in cases of organised paper leaks, where “organised crime” is defined as unlawful activity by a group of persons colluding in a conspiracy “to pursue or promote a shared interest for wrongful gain in respect of a public examination”. Section 11(1) says the punishment for organised crime will be “imprisonment for a term not less than five years but which may extend to ten years” and a fine “which shall not be less than Rs 1 crore”. There were at least 48 instances of paper leaks in 16 states over the last five years, in which the process of hiring for government jobs was disrupted, as per a report by The Indian Express. The leaks impacted the lives of at least 1.51 crore applicants for about 1.2 lakh posts. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Bill says: “Malpractices in public examinations lead to delays and cancellation of examinations, adversely impacting the prospects of millions of youth. At present, there is no specific substantive law to deal with unfair means adopted or offences committed… It is imperative that elements that exploit vulnerabilities of examination system are identified and effectively dealt with by a comprehensive Central legislation.” It clarifies that “Candidate as defined in the Bill shall not be liable for action within the purview of the Bill and shall continue to be covered under the extant administrative provisions of the concerned public examination authority.” AIPMT : The All India Pre-Medical Test (AIPMT), now known as NEET, question paper was leaked in 2011 in Haryana. Some candidates were reported to be using electronic devices, such as mobile phones and Bluetooth devices, to receive answers during the examination. The incident led to the cancellation of the exam, affecting thousands of aspiring medical students. IIT-JEE : The question papers of IIT-JEE (Indian Institutes of Technology Joint Entrance Examination), conducted every year for admissions into the IITs, were leaked in 1997 in Lucknow. According to reports, the papers were circulated through various channels, giving some candidates an unfair advantage over others. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), which was responsible for conducting the IIT-JEE at the time, decided to cancel the exam and conduct a re-examination later that year. In 2021, the paper was leaked again and a few foreign nationals were involved. SSC CGL : In 2018, the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) Combined Graduate Level (CGL) examination faced allegations of irregularities such as discrepancies in the conduct of the examination, including technical glitches and question paper leaks. AIIMS : Question papers were leaked on social media for recruitment of 3,055 nursing officers through the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) exams. The exam was scheduled to be held in June 2023. On the day of the exam, screenshots of the question papers were circulated on social media leading to speculations of paper leak. The CBI arrested the offenders. Vyapam Scam: The Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board (MPPEB) scam revolved around the Vyapam, an acronym for Vyavsayik Pariksha Mandal, a body responsible for conducting various entrance exams for professional courses and recruitment exams for government jobs in the state. The scam came to light in 2013 when irregularities and malpractices in the recruitment and admission processes conducted by Vyapam were exposed. Impersonation, tampering with answer sheets, and leaking question papers were among the common tactics employed to benefit certain candidates. A CBI court in 2019 convicted 31 people in the case."

Nearly 24 lakh students have appeared for NEET-UG 2024. (Image: PTI) The paper leak allegations in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) and cancellation of UGC-NET 2024 over integrity claims have put spotlight on the security protocols and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to conduct public examinations in India. Reports say the UGC-NET was cancelled after inputs from Indian cyber crime coordination centre suggested possible compromises, prompting the Ministry of Education to take action. The matter has been referred to the CBI and a new examination will be scheduled. Over 900,000 candidates had sat for the exam, which is conducted to determine eligibility for junior research fellowships. Meanwhile, the NEET will be re-conducted for the 1,563 students on June 23, 2024 who were given “grace marks” due to time loss during the originally scheduled examination on May 5. However, a panel decided to cancel the grace marks following allegations of discrepancies, thus necessitating the re-exam. Nearly 24 lakh students had appeared for the NEET-UG 2024. In today development, four men were arrested in Bihar in connection with the leaking of the NEET question paper. Among those arrested are three aspirants and a junior engineer at the Danapur municipal council. The suspects admitted to receiving and memorising the leaked question paper. Mastermind Amit Anand had admitted to orchestrating the leak and disclosed that candidates were provided with the paper and answers for a price ranging from Rs 30-32 lakh. For offline exams, the issue of security begins at the press. The printer should be selected on the basis of reputation rather than the “lowest quote”. A representative of the examining organisation should be physically present during printing, packaging and despatch of the papers, as per a report by The Hindu . The question paper packets should be received by the superintending officer of each centre who should store them securely until the exam. This procedure has been in place for entrance exams, including the Tamil Nadu Professional Courses Entrance Exams, at Anna University, Chennai, without any hassles. Another important thing, when the question paper is sent to the exam centre to be printed, the email should be encrypted and the password made available only to the designated authority. The Gujarat Lokayukta had suggested that question papers be printed at government-owned press where the responsibility could be fixed. This came after the question paper leaks in various examinations conducted by the Gujarat Subordinate Services Selection Board (GSSSB). Lokayukta demanded more autonomy for itself and urged the government to amend the Gujarat Lokayukta Act, 1986. For Online Exams Though paper may differ from candidate to candidate, technical glitches can affect the conduct of the exam and the question paper security. This is what happened in the first edition of the Common University Entrance Test (CUET) in 2022 and the exams had to be postponed in many centres. In 2022, the National Testing Agency (NTA) installed new “security patches” two hours ahead of the UGC-NET exam. This additional layer of safety measure meant downloading and installing the new software randomly. The installation was successful in 304 centres but seven centres faced technical issues because of which the exams had to be cancelled. Vineet Joshi, who was heading the NTA as Director-General at that time, had said the centres were being asked to stay completely isolated and computers should not be booked for any other activity. He also pointed out that the NTA deletes the specific software it uses once the exam gets over. In 2018, several technical snags affected the online exam conducted by the Ministry of Education of the United Arab Emirates. The authorities immediately moved to the offline mode and got over the difficulty with only 30 minutes delay. “Such measures can be adopted by allowing for adequate manpower and basic materials such as a master copy of the question paper kept ready to create the required number of hard copies in convenient nodal centres,” a report by The Hindu quoted as saying. Candidates appearing for the exam should follow the NEET UG 2024 dress code as provided by NTA. Shoes are also prohibited. Henceforth, the candidates are advised to wear slippers or sandals. Do not carry any banned items along and will have to undergo the security procedures. No bio-breaks would be allowed during the first one hour after the beginning of the exam and the last half an hour of the exam. Apart from the biometric attendance and frisking at entry, candidates will be frisked and biometric attendance will be taken again on entry from bio-break or toilets break. The NTA implemented various measures such as multistage biometric authentication for both candidates and invigilation staff, surprise visits by flying squads, utilisation of AI tools to identify discrepancies in candidates’ application details, thorough invigilation supervision, among others."

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk Edited By: Shilpy Bisht News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 17:07 IST New Delhi, India According to Pew Research Center’s 2021 estimates, Indians account for the third-largest group of undocumented immigrants in the US. Immigrant families in the US will be happy to hear this. The Joe Biden administration has announced an immigration policy that will offer legal status and streamline the path to residency and citizenship to half a million unauthorised immigrants who are married to American citizens. The new policy will also allow young immigrants to apply for work permits and deportation protections if they have lived in the US for at least 10 years and meet other requirements. Though undocumented spouses will still need to file necessary paperwork and pass a criminal background check. Applicants must have been legally married to their American citizen spouse by June 17. As per the current federal law, the immigrants who entered the US illegally are required to leave the country and then re-enter legally to apply for a green card. With the new Biden policy, eligible immigrants could potentially obtain a green card without needing to leave the US. After obtaining a green card, the immigrant can apply for the citizenship after living in the US for a certain amount of time. Earlier, if a non-citizen marries a US citizen, then he or she might have had to leave the country to apply for a green card. But now, after marrying a US citizen for 10 years or more and not having broken any law, a person will be eligible to stay in the US while his or her green card application is being reviewed. According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), 500,000 non-citizen spouses of US citizens, who have lived in the country for over 23 years, may be eligible under the new plan. The change could help companies find and hire qualified workers quickly. The new policy aims to make the legal immigration process smoother and more efficient for both employers and workers. The new policy will help Indian immigrants married to US citizens and have lived in the country for 10 years. It will alleviate the deportation concerns in those Indian-American households. This means undocumented spouses gain the ability to work legally and contribute actively to their families’ incomes and improve the financial situation. The policy change could extend benefits to H4 dependent children, potentially granting them Employment Authorization Documents (EADs). This would allow these children to pursue summer jobs and save for college expenses, significantly expanding their opportunities compared to current restrictions. According to Pew Research Center’s 2021 estimates, Indians account for the third-largest group of undocumented immigrants in the US. The new policy prioritises expediting employment-based non-immigrant visas, which are temporary work visas. This doesn’t directly address the concerns of Indian-Americans on H-1B visas who might want a permanent residency. While expediting work visas for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients and some undocumented immigrants might be positive, it could also create more competition for the limited number of H-1B visas available each year. This could make it harder for some Indian IT professionals to obtain H-1B visas. There is a 7% on green card allotment per year based on the birth country of the immigrant and not their nationality. The new policy does not address the concerns of green card applicants nor did it bring any reform to the process. Many of the high-skilled foreign workers in the US are H1-B visa holders, which allows them to live and work in the country for a maximum of six years. During this period, they have to find an employer who will file an employment-based green card application on their behalf."

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk News18.com Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 16:07 IST New Delhi, India Every year, more than one crore students register for various examinations conducted by the NTA. (Representational image/ PTI) The controversy over the medical entrance exam NEET UG is not over yet, even as the UGC NET exam was also cancelled over the possibility of a paper leak. Due to the controversy over two big exams one after the other, serious questions have been raised on the credibility of their organising body, the National Testing Agency. The NTA conducts about 15 entrance and fellowship exams, in which more than one crore youngsters participate. This makes NTA one of the largest exam-conducting agencies in the world. The National Testing Agency (NTA), established in 2017, conducts entrance examinations for admission/fellowship in higher educational institutions of the country. According to the information given on the agency’s website, it is a specialised and autonomous institution established under the Indian Societies Registration Act 1860. Every year, more than one crore students register for various examinations conducted by the NTA. In 2023, the figure was 1.23 crore, making the NTA the second-largest exam-conducting agency in the world after China’s Gaokao. There were one crore 29 lakh registrations for the Gaokao exam in 2023. This year, more than 23 lakh applications were received for NEET UG conducted by NTA, while there were 13.4 lakh applications for CUET UG and 99,717 for CUET PG. Apart from this, 14.7 lakh students had registered for JEE Mains, the country’s largest engineering entrance exam. More than 11 lakh applications were received this year for UGC NET, another major exam conducted by the NTA. Before the advent of NTA, the responsibility of conducting medical and engineering entrance examinations was with institutions like CBSE and AICTE. After NTA took over the responsibility, the burden of conducting examinations on these institutions was reduced. Although NTA was formed in 2017, the roots of this agency can be traced back to the Programme of Action 1992 connected to the National Education Policy 1986, in which the formation of a national-level examination agency was advised. The NTA is not only responsible for conducting entrance/fellowship examinations but also does research on educational, professional, and testing systems so that gaps in the knowledge system can be identified and eliminated. This agency identifies experts and institutions to prepare questions for the examinations. The administration of the NTA is handled through a governing body, which consists of a chairperson, a member secretary (director general), and eight members. The NTA chairperson is appointed by the ministry of human resource development and is usually a famous academician. Currently, the chairperson of the NTA is former UPSC chairman and retired professor Pradeep Kumar Joshi. Its director general is IAS Subodh Kumar Singh, who is also appointed by the central government. The Board of Governors includes members of the institutions conducting the test. According to the information on the NTA website, first of all, the subject experts prepare the test items. After this, banks of questions are prepared. Then the Test Development Committee checks it. After this, the question paper is written. Then the paper is checked again. After all these steps, the final paper is prepared. The NTA mainly makes the question paper, while the examination is organised through outsourcing. The agency issues different tenders for work related to conducting the examination. These companies look after the entire work of the examination centre. According to reports, the entire staff conducting the examination is also outsourced. The NTA issues tenders for the exam centre and its arrangements. Through this, arrangements for computers, CCTV systems, etc, are made. Apart from this, the hiring of staff is also done through a tender process. The NTA had issued tenders for outsourced staff like technical support group, office assistant, senior assistant, consultant, consulting adviser, data analyst, etc. It had asked for the educational details of these staff. Many of these people get salaries in lakhs. The NTA had also issued tenders for QR code solutions. Several companies were hired for this."

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk Edited By: Shilpy Bisht News18.com Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 10:31 IST New Delhi, India The ED challenged the trial court’s order on the ground that the court had failed to apply the 'twin test' for granting bail to Arvind Kejriwal under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. (Photo: PTI) Arvind Kejriwal has been granted bail by a trial court on money laundering charges but the Delhi High Court has put on hold his bail until it hears the matter next week linked to the now-scrapped excise policy. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) challenged the trial court’s order on the ground that the court had failed to apply the “twin test” for granting bail under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Kejriwal has been in jail since March 21, and was granted bail for a brief period to campaign in the Lok Sabha election held last month. Offences under the stringent PMLA are cognisable and non-bailable. The Section 45 of the PMLA deals with the ‘twin conditions’ of bail. The first condition is that the person has to prove in court that he or she prima facie is innocent of the offence. Secondly, the accused should be able to convince the judge he would not commit any offence while on bail. The section makes it mandatory to hear the public prosecutor in all bail applications, and when the prosecutor opposes bail, the court is required to apply a twin test. The burden of proof is entirely on the jailed accused, who would be often weak to fight the might of the state. The twin conditions make it almost impossible for an accused to get bail under the PMLA. Similar provisions are mentioned in other laws that deal with serious offences — Section 36AC of The Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, Section 37 of The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, and Section 43D(5) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. Under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), “No person accused of an offence punishable under Chapters IV (Punishment for Terrorist Activities) and VI (Terrorist Organisations) of this Act shall…be released on bail or on his own bond unless the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity of being heard”, or if the court “is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation…is prima facie true”. In the 2017 ruling in Nikesh Tarachand Shah v Union of India, a two-judge bench struck down the twin bail provision as unconstitutional, citing it failed the tests of ‘reasonable classification’. Reasonable classification’ is a feature of the right to equality, which is a fundamental right. But the provision was adopted back by Parliament through the Finance Act, 2018. It was challenged by various high courts later. In 2022, the Supreme Court heard a batch of petitions in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v Union of India. Petitioners argued that the reasoning in Nikesh Tarachand Shah was still valid, even if Parliament reinstated the law. However, a three-judge Bench rejected the previous ruling. The Bench disagreed with the observations in Nikesh Tarachand Shah. It stressed that the perception of Parliament regarding the seriousness of money-laundering and its threats to national sovereignty and integrity. Experts have questioned the logic of comparing money laundering cases with anti-terror and narcotic laws. The government, however, has argued that person involved in money laundering are “influential, intelligent, and resourceful, and the crime is committed with full pre-meditation, which ensures that offence is not detected and even if it is detected, investigation agency cannot trace the evidence”. One major challenge to the amendment on bail in the Vijay Madanlal Choudhary ruling involves whether these amendments can be passed through the Money Bill route. A larger Bench of the SC is set to review if laws like the Aadhaar Act and service conditions for Tribunal members can be passed this way, though the Bench is yet to be constituted. Although the Supreme Court has agreed to review its ruling in the Vijay Madanlal Choudhary case, the decision remains valid as no stay has been issued. The ruling mandates that the twin test must be strictly applied by all courts, including special and constitutional courts, for both regular and anticipatory bail. Despite this, an accused can still be eligible for bail under Section 436A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). It allows for the release of those who have served half of their maximum sentence. The bail was given by a vacation judge in the Rouse Avenue Court upon furnishing a bail bond of Rs 1 lakh on June 20. The ED requested the court to defer signing of the bail bond by 48 hours so that the order may be challenged before the appellate court. However, the court rejected the plea and asked for production of the bail bond before the duty judge on June 21. The trial court then challenged the order for immediate hearing. Kejriwal’s counsel Vikram Chaudhri had told the court that the case against him was based entirely on the statements of people who were not only tainted but had also been arrested and subsequently promised bail for supporting ED’s case. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju, who was appearing for the ED, told the court that the agency was “not conducting an investigation in the air but possessed concrete evidence”, as quoted by The Economic Times."

Coli outbreak. (Getty Images) Nearly 86 people have been admitted to hospital in the UK as a result of E. Coli outbreak, which has been linked to salads containing lettuce. There are 256 confirmed cases of the E. Coli infection across the UK, according to health officials. Food manufacturers have recalled sandwiches, wraps, salads and rolls in supermarkets and retail chains over fears that they are linked to the outbreak. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has said lettuce is thought to be the likely source of the outbreak. All the recorded cases involve Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O145 (Stec), as mentioned by The Guardian . According to the Cleveland Clinic, E. coli (Escherichia coli) is a group of bacteria that normally resides in the gut (gastrointestinal/GI tract) of healthy people and animals. The strains that inhabit the intestine are generally harmless and even aid in digestion. However, under certain conditions, some strains of E. coli can cause illnesses such as diarrhea, stomach cramps and a high fever. The Shiga toxin-strain of E. coli (STEC) is a bacterium known for causing severe foodborne diseases, including food poisoning. In the current outbreak, all recorded cases involve STEC, with young children, elderly people, and those with underlying conditions in their immune systems at the most risk. The UK sees about 1,500 cases of STEC annually, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), E. Coli is transmitted to humans primarily through consumption of contaminated foods, such as raw or undercooked ground meat products and milk. Faecal contamination of water and other foods, as well as cross-contamination during food preparation (with beef and other meat products, contaminated surfaces and kitchen utensils), can also lead to infection. It is often spread by close contact with an infected person, as well as direct contact with an infected animal or its environment. An increasing number of outbreaks are associated with the consumption of fruits and vegetables (including sprouts, spinach, lettuce, coleslaw, and salad) whereby contamination may be due to contact with faeces from domestic or wild animals during cultivation. There are three ways by which lettuce leaves can become contaminated with E. Coli. According to a crop science expert, Professor Jim Monaghan, at Harper Adams University, as quoted by SkyNews , “E. coli essentially wants to be inside the guts of warm-blooded animals.” Pathogenic strains can be found in 10-15% of dairy herds, meaning that a minority of manure is contaminated with E. coli. These leaves get contaminated by manure. In cases of indirect contamination, the bacteria can enter the soil or water and then can be transferred to the lettuce. According to US government regulators, greens and lettuces pose a particular food safety risk. According to one Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analysis, leafy vegetables were responsible for 22% of foodborne illnesses between 1998 and 2008 in the US. Some of the symptoms that a Shiga toxin-producing strain of E. coli include bloody diarrhea, harsh stomach cramps, vomiting and a fever. The UKHSA said hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) may occur up to two weeks after the start of the diarrhoea while adding, “If your symptoms do not go away or you develop easy bruising, feel you are passing less urine than usual or your urine is pink/brown in colour, please urgently seek medical advice as these symptoms could indicate the start of HUS and you may need further tests.” Further complications could include thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which is when blood clots form throughout the body as a result of the illness. Some patients may also develop hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is linked to kidney failure and can cause life-threatening complications. There is no particular treatment for a STEC infection, which typically resolves on its own within about a week, according to CDC. However, managing symptoms involves staying well-hydrated since diarrhoea can quickly lead to dehydration. It’s crucial to avoid antibiotics as they can heighten the chances of developing complications like HUS. • Wash your hands properly • Cook meat thoroughly • Keep raw meats separate from cooked ones, and sanitise cutting boards after cutting up raw meats • Enjoy pasteurised dairy and juices, not raw milk • And wash produce before you eat it • Wash leafy greens like spinach properly as they are prone to picking up bacteria that might run off from cattle farms"

(Getty Images) An Indian worker died in Italy tragically after he was dumped on the road without any medical assistance after his arm was severed by heavy farm machinery. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said Satnam Singh, one of thousands of Indian immigrants who work the fields in the country, was the victim of “inhuman acts”. Singh was reportedly left on the side of the road near his home with his arm severed and his legs crushed. He was injured while working in a melon greenhouse in the Agro Pontino, a rural area south of Rome. He died at a hospital in Rome on Wednesday. The BBC quoted Italian media as saying that Singh’s boss, Antonello Lovato, left Singh and his wife by the roadside near their home. Singh’s severed arm was placed in a fruit box. Medical help reached Singh until an hour and a half later. He was airlifted to a hospital in Rome but died. Singh’s employer Antonello Lovato is now under investigation for criminal negligence and manslaughter. Singh, who was in his early 30s, was reportedly living and working as an undocumented immigrant in Italy for around two years. The Flai CGIL trade union has called for a strike of agricultural workers to protest the death of Singh, the BBC reported. Maurizio Landini, the union’s secretary general, said: “We are faced with a situation of real slavery. The death of a worker — an undocumented worker — is of unprecedented gravity.” Reports have pointed to gangmasters or ‘Caporali’ who are employed by local farmers to find cheap, readily available hand-pickers rather than employing them directly. These gangmasters take a share of workers’ wages and charge them for transport to the fields, as well as the food and water they receive. Almost a quarter of the agricultural workforce in Italy in 2018 was employed under this method, according to a study by the Italian National Institute of Statistics. The practice also affects workers in the service industry and building sectors. In 2016, an Italian woman had died of a heart attack while working for 12 hours daily to pick and sort grapes. Under this system, workers, even the ones who are in Italy legally, are paid extremely meagre wages, and live in shacks or hovels or shanty towns – where there are no schools or hospitals. According to a report by the CNN , migrants were found to work under a gangmaster, with no employment contract, and for more than 10 hours a day. “For each 300-kilo box of tomatoes filled by the workers, the landowner gives €5 ($5.80) to an Italian middle-man who deals with the gangmaster. After they both take their cut, the worker gets €3 ($2.5). Migrants are charged €5 for transport. Sometimes five more for food,” the CNN report quoted as saying in 2018. Workplace accident insurance agency INAIL said earlier this month that fatal accidents in Italy had risen by four to 268 in the first four months of this year. There were about 100 last year, it said, as reported by news agency PTI . Latina, a Mussolini-founded new town south of Rome and where Singh lived, hosts thousands of immigrant labourers, many of them Sikhs, working picking fruits and vegetables for the local ‘agro-mafia’. An agreement between India and Italy allows 10,000 Indian workers to go there in 2024. Under the agreement, around 30,000 Indian workers can enter Italy for seasonal or non-seasonal employment between 2023 and 2025. Most Sikh migrants work in Italy’s dairy sector, as fruit pickers or in olive gardens. In another case, a few years ago, an Indian Sikh migrant, Balbir Singh, from Punjab had described his slave-like conditions tending to cattle in Latina. He told media that he used to work for 12-13 hours a day, including Sundays, with no holidays and rest. The farm owner paid him 100 to 150 euros ($120 to $175) a month, he said, which amounts to less than 50 cents an hour, as quoted by news agency AFP . The legal minimum for farm workers is around 10 euros an hour. Balbir Singh was rescued by a police raid on March 17, 2017 after appealing for help via Facebook and WhatsApp to local Indian community leaders and an Italian rights activist. Officers found him living in a caravan, with no gas, hot water or electricity, and eating the leftovers that his boss either threw in the bin or gave to chickens and pigs. The UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery in 2018 said over 400,000 agricultural workers in Italy are at risk of exploitation. Nearly 100,000 likely face “inhumane conditions”. According to 2021 data from national statistics office Istat, around 11% of Italian workers were employed illegally, rising to more than 23% in agriculture."

(AP Photo) More than 1,300 people have died due to extreme heat during the annual Hajj pilgrimage that takes place in Saudi Arabia, authorities have said. Amongst the dead are 98 Indians, the Indian government has said. More than half of those who died were unregistered pilgrims and joined the Hajj through irregular channels, leaving them unable to access facilities such as air conditioned tents and buses, news agency AFP reported. Although Saudi Arabia has increased safety measures at the Hajj in recent years, but it still faces criticism for not doing enough, particularly for unregistered pilgrims. As per MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal 98 Indians have died during the pilgrimage this year. “We have heard that because it was very hot, and on the day of Arafat, the pilgrims who come there, several people suffered that day due to the heat wave. People from other countries suffered more. From our country, six people died on the day of Arafat,” he said. Hajj is the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia that is required once in a lifetime of every Muslim who can afford it and is physically able to make it. Some Muslims make the journey more than once. It occurs once a year during the Islamic lunar month of Dhul-Hijja, the 12th and final month of the Islamic calendar year. Hajj is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, in addition to the profession of faith, prayer, almsgiving and fasting. For pilgrims, performing Hajj fulfills a religious obligation, but it’s also a deeply spiritual experience of a lifetime for many. It’s seen as a chance to seek God’s forgiveness for past sins, to grow closer to God and to walk in the footsteps of prophets. Extreme Heat : Severe heat conditions are believed to be the major factor behind the high death toll. The Saudi Arabia health ministry had warned pilgrims to avoid heat exposure and stay hydrated but many fell victim to heatstroke. Scientists have said that global warming is worsening the summer. Pilgrims who travel for Hajj face unfamiliar heat, strenuous physical activity, and many of them are elderly or unwell. According to Carl-Friedrich Schleussner of Climate Analytics, who spoke to Reuters , with a 1.5C rise in global temperatures above pre-industrial levels, the risk of heatstroke during Hajj could increase up to five times. Overcrowding : The health authorities were called out for mismanagement that exacerbated extreme conditions, leading to crisis at some places. Pilgrims said accommodation and facilities were poorly managed, with overcrowded tents lacking adequate cooling and sanitation facilities, as mentioned in a BBC report. A government statement, however, said resources were made available for pilgrims, which included 189 hospitals, health centres and mobile clinics with a combined capacity of more than 6,500 beds, and over 40,000 medical, technical, administrative staff and volunteers. Transportation : Some pilgrims had complained of walking long distance in extreme heat, with some blaming roadblocks and poor management. Saad Al-Qurashi, an adviser to the National Committee for Hajj and Umrah, told the BBC: “Anyone who does not have a Hajj visa will not be tolerated and must return to [their] country.” Every year, the number of pilgrims performing Hajj increases, with billions spent on infrastructure by the Saudi authorities. In order to accommodate several thousands of pilgrims in one location, the Saudi authorities allot country-wise quotas, which determine the total number of people who can take the journey. This is largely done based on the number of Muslims in a particular country. This year, Saudi Arabia allowed 1.75 lakh Indians to undertake the pilgrimage — 1.4 lakh went through the official Haj Committee of India, and the rest went through more expensive private operators. The Hajj Committee of India (HCoI) distributes to different states on the basis of their Muslim population. A total of 1.8 million slots were handed out by the Saudis worldwide. The Indian government has a Hajj mission in Jeddah. It provides a medical mission, hospital, ambulances and arrangements for Indian citizens by Indian officials overseas. According to the Union Health Ministry, nearly 40,000 people over the age of 60 years undertook the Hajj this year. Union Health Secretary Apurva Chandra said “harsh weather conditions” this year have necessitated round-the-clock services for the pilgrims. A live portal was developed to provide real-time data and analysis on the pilgrims seeking medical care, and the services being provided. Historically, Hajj has witnessed stampede-like situations and epidemics during the pilgrimage, which attracts over 2 million people from around the world. In 2015, a stampede in Mina killed over 2,400 pilgrims, the deadliest incident ever to strike the pilgrimage, according to the Associated Press. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede. A separate crane collapse at Mecca’s Grand Mosque earlier the same year killed 111. The second-deadliest incident at the Hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people. More than 1.83 million Muslims performed the Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to the Saudi Hajj authorities."

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk Edited By: Shilpy Bisht News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 12:01 IST New Delhi, India The BJP nominating seven-time MP Bhartruhari Mahtab (in pic) as pro-tem speaker ruffled Opposition’s feathers, with the Congress backing its senior MP K Suresh for the post. The newly elected leaders of the BJP-led NDA government and Congress-led Opposition attended the first Lok Sabha session on Monday. The session will continue till July 3. The BJP member, Bhartruhari Mahtab, took the oath as pro-tem speaker. He is tasked with running the proceedings of the House until the Speaker is elected. The BJP nominating seven-time MP Bhartruhari Mahtab as pro-tem speaker had ruffled Opposition’s feathers, with the Congress backing its senior MP K Suresh for the post. Senior leader KC Venugopal called Mahtab’s appointment “an attempt to destroy democratic and parliamentary norms…” Until the Speaker of Lok Sabha is chosen, the Pro-tem Speaker, which essentially means “for the time being”, is chosen to administer some important duties. The Constitution does not mention the post. However, the official ‘Handbook on the Working of Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs’ speaks about the ‘Appointment and Swearing in of Speaker pro tem’. The system of appointing a pro-tem speaker in India is adopted from the ‘Father of the House’ convention in the UK’s Westminster system of parliament which states that this title is bestowed on the member who has the longest unbroken service in the parliament and this member will be responsible for presiding over the House until the Speaker is elected. The Speaker has to fulfill certain responsibilities regarding the day-to-day proceedings of the House. As per Article 94 of the Indian Constitution states: “Whenever the House of the People is dissolved, the Speaker shall not vacate his office until immediately before the first meeting of the House of the People after the dissolution.” According to the Congress, Mahtab’s appointment by the BJP deviates from the traditional practice of appointing the senior member, adding that it is an “established tradition” in the Lok Sabha that the senior-most MP becomes the pro-tem Speaker. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh has alleged that K Suresh’s nomination was ignored because of his Dalit lineage. “If this argument is adopted, then why has Ramesh Chandappa Jigajinagi, a BJP MP who is also in his seventh consecutive term, not been considered? Is it because he is a Dalit like Suresh,” the AICC general secretary in-charge of communications quoted as saying by Hindustan Times . The BJP, however, said the allegation of Congress falls flat as K Suresh has only served eight nonconsecutive terms, having lost in 1998 and 2004, compared to Mahtab who has served seven consecutive terms as Lok Sabha MP. Hence, this is only Suresh’s fourth consecutive term as Lok Sabha MP, thus not qualifying him for the post of a Pro-tem Speaker. In the 17th Lok Sabha, the pro-tem was appointed based on the number of years the MP has served in Lok Sabha. Virendra Kumar was appointed as pro-tem speaker by the President as he was the longest-serving consecutively elected MP then compared to Maneka Gandhi who was the senior-most MP but in non-consecutive terms. In 1956, Sardar Hukam Singh was appointed to the post of Pro-tem Speaker even though he was not the senior-most MP. In 1977 too, DN Tiwari was appointed as pro tem speaker even though he was not the senior-most member of the House. When the post of the Speaker falls vacant, the “duties of the Speaker are to be performed by a Member of the House appointed for this purpose by the President as Speaker pro tem”, according to the Handbook. The primary duty of the pro-tem Speaker is to administer oaths to the new MPs. Under Article 99 of the Constitution, “Every Member of the House shall, before taking his seat, make and subscribe before the President or some person appointed in that behalf by him, an oath or affirmation according to the form set out for the purpose in the Third Schedule of the Constitution.” According to the handbook, the senior-most members (in terms of number of years of membership of the House) are generally chosen for the purpose, though there have been exceptions. After the new government is formed, the Legislative I Section of the Government of India prepares a list of the senior-most Lok Sabha members, which is submitted to the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs or the Prime Minister for identifying an MP as pro-tem Speaker and another three members for oath-taking. Bhartruhari Mahtab, son of Odisha’s former Chief Minister, Harekrushna Mahtab, was with Naveen Patnaik-led Biju Janata Dal (BJD) prior to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Mahtab, 66, had announced his resignation from the party in March, citing reduced activity within the party recently. Later, he joined the BJP. Bhatruhari currently is the owner and editor of The Prajatantra, an Odia daily founded by his father — Harekrushna – who was a member of the Congress and played a crucial role in the Independence. Bhatruhari has been elected as an MP seven times from Cuttack. He won the 2024 Lok Sabha elections from the seat by more than 57,000 votes. Mahtab received the Outstanding Parliamentarian Award in 2017, and the Sansad Ratna Award 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 for his outstanding role as an MP. Bhartruhari Mahtab became BJP’s choice after the party’s clean sweep in Odisha polls. The BJP dislodged Naveen Patnaik’s 24-year regime, winning 78 seats, four above the majority mark, and formed the government in the state. The BJD won 51 seats, while the Congress won 14 and the CPI(M) won one seat. The BJP won 20 out of 21 Lok Sabha seats in the state."

    "article_content": "Curated By : News Desk Local News Desk Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 14:22 IST Hyderabad, India The women make organic fertilisers and pesticides. For more than twenty years, women from the Self Help Group (SHG) in Algol village, Zaheerabad Mandal in Telangana, have been producing organic fertilisers and pesticides, securing their income. These women manufacture neem oil and neem cake. Neem oil is applied as an organic insect repellent across various crops, while neem cake serves as an organic fertiliser. The SHG members of Algol have sustained the production of neem oil and cake for over two decades. Twenty-five years ago, the Deccan Development Society (DDS) provided a machine to these women to promote organic farming in the region. However, production halted for a few years due to various challenges. Four years ago, the Sangareddy district administration stepped in to support these women by providing three machines. Since then, the 15 women have resumed production and have been sustaining it for the past four years. Suvarna, one of the members, explained that every year during the season, they purchase neem seeds from Jadcherla, Tandur, and other parts of the State. Neem trees typically bear fruits in July and August. These fruits are dried and used to produce oil and cake. The women receive orders from farmers across the State who practice organic farming. After crushing one quintal of neem seeds, the women obtain 95 kilograms of cake and 5 litres of oil. They purchase the seeds at Rs. 30 per kilogram and sell the cake for Rs. 35 per kilogram, while the oil fetches Rs. 400 per litre. Each litre of oil can yield 200 litres of pesticide when mixed with water. The women have gained recognition for their efforts, as few others are producing these two products. Another member of the SHG, Nirmalamma, has appealed to the government for assistance in scaling up their year-round production of neem oil and cake, as well as in marketing their products. She expressed that they currently face challenges in gathering sufficient funds to purchase a large quantity of seeds at the start of each year."

(Image: X) Another Revanna family member, Suraj, a JD(S) MLC and son of former Karnataka minister HD Revanna, has been arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a party worker. An FIR was registered against him at the Holenarasipura police station under Section 377 (unnatural sex) of the IPC. The allegations against Suraj Revanna, 36, stem from a complaint filed by a 27-year-old male party worker. “I absolutely reject these allegations. They are part of a political conspiracy. An FIR has also been lodged against the complainant. Let the truth come out. I have faith in the law of the land,” Suraj Revanna had said. Suraj Revanna, a member of the legislative council (MLC) in Karnataka, is the eldest son of Holenarasipur MLA HD Revanna, the brother of Prajwal Revanna and the grandson of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda. Suraj is the eighth member of the Gowda family to make his way into politics. He began his political career by campaigning for his father during the Assembly elections in 2013, when he was a medical student. He showed an interest in joining active politics after completing his postgraduation in general surgery in 2015. Suraj focused on strengthening the party organisation in Channarayapatna taluk while his younger brother contested and won the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. Suraj became an MLC in 2021. During his active campaigning during the 2018 Assembly elections and the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Suraj and his associates were involved in arguments and clashes with other party workers. His affidavit for the MLC polls in 2021 showed that his name was dropped by the Hassan district in two cases, as per a report by The Hindu. He got married in 2018 but did not mention about his marriage in the election affidavit in 2021. Later, a petition was filed in the high court for alleging suppressing the fact about his marriage in the affidavit, The Hindu report said. Despite internal party squabbles over his candidature for the Legislative Council in 2021, Suraj won and represented Hassan. According to the complainant, Suraj Revanna allegedly committed “unnatural offences” and sexually abused him at his Gannikada farm in Holenarasipura on June 16. In his complaint, the victim stated that he was an active JD(S) worker and had met Suraj at Kollangi village during the last Lok Sabha campaigns. Suraj was brought to Bengaluru by the Hassan police on Sunday following his arrest. He was produced before the magistrate of Special Court of Magistrate for criminal cases against former and present MPs and MLAs, at his residence at Koramangala after he was subjected to a medical examination. The judge then remanded Suraj in judicial custody for 14 days. The Holenarsipur Rural police registered the case against him and his associate Shivakumar HL, under Sections 377 (unnatural offences), 342 (wrongful confinement), and 506 (criminal intimidation). The entire Revanna family has been embroiled in a controversy after pen drives containing videos of Prajwal Revanna with different women surfaced in Hassan during the election campaign. His father HD Revanna and mother Bhavani are out on bail. They have been accused of kidnapping and keeping an alleged victim of their son Prajwal’s sexual assaults. Prajwal Revanna arrested by the SIT at the Kempegowda International Airport, in Bengaluru on May 31 following his return from Germany where he was holed up after rape and intimidation cases were registered against him. He is presently in custody of the Special Investigation Team, formed exclusively to probe the charges against him."

    "article_content": "Published By : Ritayan Basu Trending Desk Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 14:38 IST New Delhi, India Jacob Fatu on WWE debut (X) Jacob Fatu made a roaring debut at the Friday Night SmackDown. Fatu, who has plied his trade in the independent circuit for more than a decade, has partnered with Solo Sikoa, Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa to become the new member of the Bloodline family. On his first day with WWE, Cody Rhodes was slated to face off against Sikoa in a one-on-one bout. The match saw interference from Tonga and Loa, who launched a surprise attack on Rhodes at the ringside. That’s when Kevin Owens and Randy Orton came forward to help the Undisputed WWE Champion. The trio then took down Tonga and Loa before shifting their focus to Sikoa, who received some brutal treatments before Fatu made a sudden appearance. Jacob Fatu was quick to take down Cody Rhodes and Randy Orton with a super kick. Kevin Owens came running to assist his friends but failed to save them from the ire of Fatu. The Bloodline member went hard on Rhodes and smashed him on the announce desk. Once his opponents were down, Fatu went into the ring and celebrated the win with Solo Sikoa, Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa. Jacob Fatu has worked with several independent promotions like PCW, AAW, GCW and West Coast Pro before becoming a free agent in February this year. He is the son of former WWE star Sam Fatu and the nephew of the legendary Rikishi and Umaga. Fatu started making noise during his time with Major League Wrestling. He joined the company as a member of the Contra Unit and eventually became its leader. As the head of the heel, Fatu secured the MLW World Heavyweight Championship and held the title for a record time. He first defended the championship at Saturday Night SuperFight against LA Park, producing a dominant performance. Fatu turned into a face after losing the MLW World Heavyweight Championship to Alex Hammerstone at War Chamber, ending his reign of 819 days. For the rest of his tenure with MLW, Fatu worked with Juicy Finau and Lance Anoa'i, forming a group– the Samoan Swat Team. They took the name from a tag team founded by Rikishi and Samu in the late 1980s. Going by his blood relation with Roman Reigns, Jimmy and Jey Uso, it was anticipated that Jacob Fatu would join the Bloodline once during his wrestling career. He was greatly inspired by the USO brothers and took training under the guidance of their famous father and his uncle Rikishi. Fatu competed in his last MLW match at SuperFight in February.

The first merit list will be released on July 12. The last day for admission is July 18 and the new academic session will commence on August 7. The second merit list will be released on August 8. A system-based merit list will be generated for the selection of candidates. A total of 25 UG courses are available across participating colleges in West Bengal.

Candidates must note that Presidency University, Jadavpur University, and some autonomous and minority colleges have been exempted from the system, West Bengal’s Education Minister Bratya Basu had said earlier. Basu had also earlier stated that the common admission process would negate the possibility of one student with good marks taking admission to multiple colleges at once, and then retaining his seat in the desired course and vacating the rest. Due to this lots of seats remain empty every year, he added. In the centralised process, one candidate will be offered only one seat at a time, depending on his results with the scope to get a better opportunity in case there is a vacancy elsewhere, he told PTI.

    "article_content": "Curated By : Shreyanka Mazumdar News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 15:08 IST Mumbai, India Kartik Aaryan's hard work and efforts in Kabir Khan's Chandu Champion yields him another film that could do well at the Box Office. Chandu Champion, starring Kartik Aaryan, saw a rise in box office collections during its second weekend. According to Sacnilk.com, the film earned Rs 6.5 crore on its second Sunday. Based on the life of Murlikant Petkar, India’s first Paralympic gold medalist in freestyle swimming, this sports drama gained momentum with positive word of mouth and no major releases this week. It exceeded its opening day earnings of Rs 4.75 crore, with day two bringing in Rs 7 crore. The film’s highest single-day collection remains day three, at Rs 9.75 crore. The movie’s collections dropped over the weekend, hitting a low of Rs 3 crore on day 6. It bounced back on Saturday, making Rs 4.85 crore, and with Sunday added, Chandu Champion has now earned Rs 49.25 crore in India. The film, directed by Kabir Khan, is based on the life of India’s first Paralympics gold medallist, Murlikant Petkar. News18 Showsha has rated Chandu Champion 4/5. Talking about Kartik’s performance in the movie, our reviewer stated, “Kartik has delivered his career-best performance that aptly conveys his character’s inner turbulence, much of it derived from Murli’s childhood bullying and people’s disbelief in his potential. Moreover, it’s the emotional yet rousing finale that will have audiences cheering for Kartik, the star.” Kartik went through rigorous training to look the part of a freestyle swimmer in the film, which involved reducing his weight from 90 kgs to 72 kgs and his body fat from 39% to 7%. In fact, Kartik recently took to social media to share a viral before-and-after transformation picture of himself that encompassed his journey from an ‘insomniac’ to a ‘fitness enthusiast’. In an exclusive chat with News18 Showsha, Kartik’s trainer said he started a ‘program-based workout’ with Kartik in 2022 for Chandu Champion, and back then, the actor was as heavy as seen in the picture that has garnered a lot of scrutiny. Talking about how Kartik’s physicality had ‘shocked’ him, he said, “In the beginning, I gave him some basic movements like squats, pull-ups and push-ups, and he couldn’t do any of it! I knew that he had gained weight for Freddy but the fact that he couldn’t pull off even these basic movements really shocked me.”"

In a shocking turn of events, South Korean rapper Zico came under the spotlight after Goo Hara’s death case has become the talk of the town yet again. Over the weekend, SBS aired an episode of Unanswered Questions focusing Goo Hara’s death. The episode also touched upon the robbery that took place at her home after her death. It was suspected of stealing a safe which had Goo Hara’s old phones. The description of the robber was also shared in the episode. According to Koreaboo, Goo Hara’s brother appeared on the episode and spoke about the stolen safe. He revealed he took out all the valuables from the safe before the robbery happened. The episode also mentioned details about the features of the robber. It was revealed the robber was 5’8 tall and likely to be in his 20s or early 30s. A sketch was also drawn and displayed on the screen. Following the description, several social media users in South Korea claimed the man looks like Zico. The speculations were all over the internet. Soon, Zico’s agency KOZ Entertainment reacted to the speculations. “We have uncovered malicious and defamatory comments on social media about our artist, Zico. We have come to the decision to take legal action due to the severity of these defamatory comments and the level of misinformation being shared,” statement read. “In addition, we would like to clearly state that the recent rumors about our artist is false and defamatory, and also that we will be taking legal action,” the agency added. Goo Hara died on November 24, 2019. The South Korean singer was found dead in her home. Her death shocked the K-pop world. Her death was ruled out as a possible suicide. The idol had attempted suicide a few months before her death but had recovered at the time."

(Image via X/@Naveen_Odisha) Bhubaneswar BJD president Naveen Patnaik held a meeting with his party’s nine Rajya Sabha MPs on Monday and asked them to emerge as a ”vibrant and strong” opposition in the Upper House of Parliament during its upcoming session that would begin on June 27. At the meeting, Patnaik also asked the lawmakers to raise issues concerning the state’s interests in a befitting manner. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the party’s leader in Rajya Sabha Sasmit Patra said, ”The BJD MPs this time will not be confined to speaking on issues only, but are determined to agitate if the BJP-led government at the Centre ignores Odisha’s interest.” Besides raising the demand for special status to Odisha, the BJD MPs will raise the issues of poor mobile connectivity and low density of bank branches in the state, he said. ”Odisha’s demand for revision of coal royalty has been ignored by the Centre for the last 10 years. This is causing great loss to the people of the state who are deprived of their rightful share,” he added. Maintaining that the nine MPs in Rajya Sabha will act as a strong opposition, Patra said Patnaik has given clear instructions to fight for the rights of the state’s people in the Parliament. When asked whether BJD would maintain its earlier stance of giving issue-based support to the BJP-led government, he said, ”No more support to BJP, only opposition. We may go to any extent to protect the interests of Odisha.” Later, Patra told PTI, ”There is no question of supporting the BJP. The BJD president asked us to act as a strong and vibrant opposition if the NDA government continues to ignore the genuine demands of Odisha.” The BJD has nine MPs in the Rajya Sabha, while it failed to win any seat in the recently held Lok Sabha elections, for the first time since its formation in 1997. The BJD also lost power in the state with the BJP bringing an end to its government of 24 years. The BJD not only supported the BJP in Parliament on different issues over the last few years but also helped Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw get elected to Rajya Sabha in 2019 and 2024. At a meeting with senior BJD leaders on Sunday, Patnaik had said, ”You all know that the BJP has got four seats more than the majority mark in the Odisha assembly. At the Centre also, it does not have a majority on its own. Hence, you should work hard, stay united, and strengthen the party.”"

    "article_content": "Reported By : Manoj Gupta CNN-News18 Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 15:13 IST New Delhi, India Many of those asked to leave were wearing T-shirts with designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s photo. (Reuters/File) Families of the 1985 Kanishka bombing victims on Sunday turned away members of the pro-Khalistan Sikhs for Justice outfit during a prayer meeting in Canada to mark the 39th anniversary of one of the most heinous terror-related air disasters in the history of civil aviation. The Montreal-New Delhi Air India ‘Kanishka’ Flight 182 had exploded 45 minutes before it was supposed to land at London’s Heathrow Airport on June 23, 1985, killing all 329 people on board, most of them Canadians of Indian descent. Eighty-six of the victims were children. The bombing was blamed on Sikh militants in retaliation to ‘Operation Bluestar’ to flush out militants from the Golden Temple in 1984. During Sunday’s prayer meeting, those present asked Sikh for Justice and other pro-Khalistani group members to leave, categorically stating that no Sikh wanted separate nation of Khalistan. The families of the victims also expressed disappointment that no representative of the Canadian government was present to mark the anniversary of the tragedy. They also condemned the moment of silence held in Canada’s House of Commons last Tuesday to mark the first anniversary of designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s death. Many of those asked to leave were wearing T-shirts with Nijjar’s photo. “This is open reflection of the Canadian Sikh community. They are overpowered by politicians and political will, and made to show the world that they want Khalistan. No Canadian Sikh wants Khalistan. They feel Western countries are doing this because they don’t want India to compete with them,” a source in the Indian High Commission said. The Indian missions in Canadian capital Ottawa and Toronto city marked the anniversary of the 1985 Kanishka bombing. High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma paid homage to the victims of “cowardly terrorist bombing”, the High Commission in Ottawa posted on X along with a series of photographs from the event. Addressing the gathering, Verma said, “No government in the world should overlook the threat of terrorism emanating from its territories for political gains. Human lives are much more important than the transitory political interests. All terrorist activities should be met with exemplary legal and social actions, before they start harming the larger humanity. Governments, security agencies, and international organisations must work in concert to dismantle terrorist networks, disrupt their financing, and counter their twisted ideologies.” The Indian mission in Toronto also marked the day. “Consul General Siddhartha Nath laid a wreath at the Air India 182 memorial, Humber Park, Etobicoke in solemn remembrance of the 329 victims of the terrorist bombing of AI 182 on this day, 39 years ago,” the Consulate General of India in Toronto posted on X along with a photograph. In another post on X, the mission said the Consul General also attended the memorial service held at Queen’s Park Toronto for the victims and met with the bereaved families. “In his remarks he highlighted the importance of unified global efforts to combat terrorism and standing firm against its glorification,” it said, sharing a series of photographs. Earlier in the day, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in a post on X paid his homage to the memory of the 329 victims of AI 182 ‘Kanishka’ who were killed on this day in 1985. “Today marks the 39th anniversary of one of the worst acts of terrorism in history,” he said. “My thoughts are with their families. The anniversary is a reminder why terrorism should never be tolerated,” Jaishankar wrote. On Friday, the Canadian police said the investigations into the bombing of the Air India Flight 182 remain “active and ongoing”, terming it the “longest” and one of the “most complex domestic terrorism” probes. In a statement, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Assistant Commissioner David Teboul called the bombing the “greatest terror-related loss of life involving and affecting Canadians” in the country’s history as he offered “deepest sympathies, understanding and support to the families of the victims”. “The Air India investigation is the longest and certainly one of the most complex domestic terrorism investigations that the RCMP has undertaken in our history,” Teboul said. “Our investigative efforts remain active and ongoing,” he said."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Raj Bhojani LawBeat Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 15:14 IST Mumbai, India A street vendor selling food in Mumbai. (Image: Shutterstock) The Bombay High Court on Monday remarked that streets and roads are cleared by the authorities when the Prime Minister or other VVIPs visit, but not otherwise for the citizens. “For years together citizens keep suffering in this manner. Courts keep on passing orders. The state is rendered helpless to say we will do this and that, we will do underground, overground..Why are we not protecting citizens who are ratepayers? When the Prime Minister or VVIPs come, roads are cleared. Why not otherwise? We need to have the state really working on this,” the court said. The division bench of the Bombay High Court, comprising Justice MS Sonak and Justice Kamal Khata, was hearing suo moto Public Interest Litigation concerning illegal hawkers on the footpaths. During the previous hearing, the bench suggested that the “mobile vendors” concept or a “pop-up market” that permits hawkers to sell their items at a particular place at particular times could be introduced by the BMC. Senior Advocate SU Kamdar, appearing for the BMC, submitted that for the vending committee elections, a returning officer was already appointed. He added that some illegal hawkers were regularly removed but they kept returning, and some FIRs were also filed. Kamdar also submitted that the suggestions of a mobile market and an over-ground market were under consideration. Justice Kamal Khata responded, emphasizing the need for the identification of hawkers. “They cannot be coming back. Because they have not been identified. Let there be a combing operation. Like biometric for slums. Take one street after another. Every street they have to identify. We have to find a solution. We have to get data on the density of hawkers. The biggest trouble is identification of hawkers. Because they can damage and they can go,” Justice Khata said. Furthermore, the bench also said that people were forced to walk on streets due unlicenced hawkers on footpaths. “At least as far as footpaths are concerned, you clear them up on a daily basis. We are forcing people to walk on the streets. That is the cascading effect. If footpaths are encroached upon, where are people to walk? That is their fundamental right. We tell our children to walk on footpaths. But if there are no footpaths, what are they going to do? There is a problem with every ratepayer. State has to do something drastic. It can be twelve years you will be working on the issue despite the Supreme Court order,” the court said. The bench asked Senior Advocate Kamdar to conduct the elections for the vendor committee within 4 weeks and listed the matter for hearing on July 22, 2024."

The NCLT approval facilitates the separation of demerging entity Raymond Ltd and Raymond Lifestyle, which will be the transferee company, with Ray Global Consumer Trading also being integrated into the new structure. Once the restructuring scheme becomes effective, shareholders of Raymond Ltd will receive four equity shares of Raymond Lifestyle for every five shares held in Raymond Ltd. Shareholders of Ray Global Consumer Trading will receive two equity shares of Raymond Lifestyle for each share held in Ray Global Consumer Trading. Equity shares of Raymond Lifestyle will be listed on the stock exchanges. Advocate Hemant Sethi and Devanshi Sethi of Hemant Sethi & Co, while appearing for all the companies argued that each of these business verticals are significantly large and mature and have a distinct attractiveness to divergent sets of investors, strategic partners, and other stakeholders. “Each business will be able to target and attract new investors with specific knowledge, expertise and risk appetite corresponding to their own businesses,” argued the lawyers for the company. “Thus, each business will have its own set of like-minded investors, thereby providing the necessary funding impetus to the long-term growth strategies of each business.” According to the companies’ petition to the NCLT Mumbai bench, the primary objective of the restructuring is to unlock the potential value of Raymond’s distinct business verticals. The textile and lifestyle segments have grown significantly, warranting independent management and operations. The separation is expected to enable focused management of each business vertical, enhance operational synergies, and streamline the corporate structure."

Neha Sharma surely knows how to raise temperatures! The actress, known for her impeccable fashion sense, recently made heads turn in her latest social media post. She looked stunning in a classic white crop top and blue jeans combo. She captioned her post, “Ain’t no Monday blues here .” The actress smiled for the camera and played with her fair to shun away her Monday blues. Neha looked ravishing in her video and left her friends gasping for breath. Check out the hot video here: A post shared by Neha Sharma (@nehasharmaofficial) Neha Sharma remains grapevine’s darling because of her strong and on-point social media and paparazzi game. Her appearances outside gyms and airports with her sister Aisha Sharma frequently catch the attention of the shutterbugs and needless to say, go viral on social media within minutes. Apart from her social media posts and sartorial sensibilities, the actor often makes headlines for her strong opinions on the film industry. And in a recent interaction with News18 Showsha, Neha makes a bold statement on how an actor is sometimes forced to play de-glam roles to be taken seriously. Known for her glamorous avatars on and off-screen, Neha too has sometimes been seen shunning the sheen and taking on parts that go against her image. “No offense to anyone but I feel that to be taken seriously in this industry, you need to de-glam yourself. If you look a certain way, they’ll call you a bad actor. I think it’s just a stereotype,” she states. According to Neha, actors like her often resort to a ‘ploy’ like this so as to change the perception that they’ve in the industry. “And if you aren’t a very good looking person, people start seeing the acting and performance in your eyes and suddenly, the little nuances in your act are appreciated a lot more. This has become a ploy for all actors including me to de-glam so that we’re taken a bit more seriously,” she adds."

Jogendranagar, India The move is aimed at improving the student-teacher ratio, Kaliprasad Chakma said (Representative image) The Tripura government has initiated an exercise to identify schools with a student strength of less than 50 and may merge them with nearby educational institutes, which have better enrolment, an official said on Sunday. The exercise, which has been taken up following the Centre’s directive last month, is expected to be completed by the end of June, he said. “As part of a plan to boost the learning system, the district education officers were asked to identify the government schools having a student strength of below 50 for merger with institutes having reasonably better enrolment,” Officer on Special Duty (OSD), Education department, Kaliprasad Chakma told PTI. The move is aimed at improving the student-teacher ratio, he said. “After completion of the exercise, the government will consider all aspects and may merge these schools with ones situated preferably within 1 km or 1.5 km radius”, he said. According to Chakma, preliminary reports indicate that the state has 800 junior and senior basic schools with a student enrolment of less than 50. In total, there are around 2,500 junior and senior basic schools in the state. After the completion of the ongoing exercise, the department will seek the opinion of school management committees (SMCs) and local bodies and then submit a report to the government to make a necessary decision for the merger, he said. “The objective of the move is to reorganise the student-teacher ratio at the primary level government schools. It has been found that three teachers are posted in a junior basic school which has only 13 students, while many schools are facing shortages of teaching staff. The problem of such distribution of teachers may be addressed by the exercise”, he said. Responding to the move, the state’s youth Congress leader Md. Shajahan Islam alleged that the BJP-led double-engine government has been “forcing the poor students to get admission to private-run schools. “The BJP government has failed to improve the education system in its six-year rule. We came to know that the education department has initiated a process to close down 160 schools in West Tripura district alone, citing less-enrolment. Where will the poor students go? The youth Congress strongly protest the move”, he said. CPI (M)-backed Tribal Students’ Union general secretary Sujit Tripura claimed that the government has been trying to shut down many schools in rural and tribal areas to deprive the tribal students of education.

(Photo Credits: Instagram) Whenever superhero movies come to mind, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is often the first thought. With a plethora of films that have entertained audiences for years, MCU filmmakers continue to innovate and surprise. One such film is the upcoming Deadpool & Wolverine. The film’s director, Shawn Levy, recently shared insights about this third installment in the Deadpool series. He claimed it is shaping up to be unlike any MCU movie audiences have seen before. In a recent interview with Total Film, Levy explained his vision for Deadpool & Wolverine. He said this movie would “break moulds” within the Marvel Universe.

In this film, they fight villain Cassandra Nova, played by Emma Corrin. “We had no idea it would be this unique moment where people are asking what the MCU means any more. Can it surprise us? Can it break moulds in ways that we don’t expect? We certainly hope that this movie is an answer to those questions,” Levy told Total Film. He further mentioned that Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, has already seen a lot of success with the MCU. Yet, he acknowledged that the consistent success of Marvel films is applause-worthy, but also hinted at the necessity for change and innovation. “You can’t keep doing the same thing ad nauseam and expect people to greet it with the same excitement,” Levy added. In addition to its fresh approach, the film will introduce some new faces to the MCU. Emma Corrin, known for her role in The Crown, will make her MCU debut as the antagonist Cassandra Nova. Joining her is Matthew Macfadyen, famous for his role in Succession. he will play a TVA agent in the film. Even before its official release, Deadpool & Wolverine has made waves in the industry.

Earlier films of the franchise, Deadpool & Deadpool 2 are available for streaming on Disney+. As for Deadpool & Wolverine, it will hit cinemas on July 26."

Almost all of us have had a chapter dedicated to the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation and its largest settlement Mohenjo-daro in our history books. Mohenjo-daro has been a peak area of interest for archeologists and history enthusiasts in general and filmmaker Ashutosh Gowariker went ahead with an ambitious project of projecting it on the big screen. In 2016, he made the film Mohenjo Daro which starred Hrithik Roshan and Pooja Hegde in the lead roles. Set during the peak of the Indus Valley Civilisation around 2016 BC, the narrative centres on a farmer’s journey to the city of Mohenjo Daro. There, he unexpectedly falls in love with a woman of high status. As their romance unfolds, they find themselves entangled in a struggle against the city’s ruling elite, facing formidable challenges as they strive to protect and preserve their civilisation. Mohenjo Daro was made on a budget of Rs 120 crore, which was huge 8 years ago. Recreating the ancient city and getting the costumes of that era right was a major challenge that Ashutosh Gowariker faced. However, despite all the grandeur and the efforts, the film did not work at the box office. Mohenjo Daro managed to collect only Rs 108 crore globally. The movie could not even recoup its budget. Did you know that much of the budget for the film was spent on the remuneration of the lead actor? Hrithik Roshan reportedly took home half of the film’s budget as his salary for the film. Although the performances and VFX of Mohenjo Daro were praised, the faulty script and screenplay as well as the historical inaccuracies were singled out for criticism. With Mohenjo Daro, Ashutosh Gowariker’s luck at the box office ran out. He next made another historical film Panipat, which starred Arjun Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt and Kriti Sanon but it also received negative reviews and ultimately tanked at the box office."

While speaking to News18, Mujahid and his family members shared the entire story of how a happy-go-lucky person, a student of class 12, fell prey to the man, who also allegedly sexually harassed him for more than two years. On the complaint of Mujahid and his family members, Muzaffarnagar Police booked the middle-aged person, identified as Om Prakash and is probing the matter. Mujahid said it all began almost two years back when he first met Om Prakash, the main accused in the case, at a local factory where Mujahid initially worked as a daily wage labourer. “Om Prakash ji was in-charge there. Quite often he used to help me out but I never thought that it was all a part of his plan,” said Mujahid. However, after a couple of months, Mujahid said that he left the job and started working at a local beauty parlour to assist his father, a farmer by profession, to meet the family’s financial needs. “Unlike the local factory where I used to get Rs 150 a day, at the beauty parlour I used to get almost Rs 450 a day, which also included tips from the customers. However, my friendship with Om Prakash continued,” Mujahid recalled. The seemingly sweet friendship, however, turned out to be a strained one when one day, Om Prakash allegedly shot some nude videos of Mujahid and threatened to release them on the internet if he didn’t obey his orders. “Om Prakash used to call me to his rented accommodation where he used to harass me sexually. I didn’t have any option than to obey his orders as he had threatened to put my videos on the internet, also he threatened me that he would kill my father if I raised an alarm,” Mujahid said. However, on June 3, things went to an extreme, when Mujahid said that Om Prakash called him to his accommodation, took away his mobile phone and other belongings and sedated him. “I woke up to the horrifying words of Om Prakash, who told me that I am a woman now and he would take me to Lucknow and would marry me. He also threatened that If I resisted, he would kill my father,” Mujahid told News18. On waking up, Mujahid said that he realised that he was at Begrajpur Medical College, Mansoorpur, Muzaffarnagar, UP, he experienced a sharp pain in his abdomen and soon after he realised that his genital part was missing. “It took me some moments to realize what actually had happened to me. I didn’t even have my mobile phone, I took some hospital staff’s phone to call my parents and asked them to reach the hospital immediately,” said Mujahid, while accusing Om Prakash, doctors and the hospital staff of performing sex change surgery on him without his consent. “ Allah unhe kabhi maaf nahi karega (God will never forgive them). I want justice. I am hopeful that UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ji would help me and would make sure that the wrong doers get the strictest punishment,” lamented Mujahid. Mujahid’s father Mohammed Yameen, who seemed shattered, further blamed Om Prakash and the team of doctors who performed the surgery. “On getting my son’s call, we immediately rushed to the hospital. Be it Om Prakash or the doctors, all are hand in gloves. I want action against Dr Farooqi, the main surgeon who performed the surgery. I want to ask the hospital management why they didn’t ask for the ID proof of my son and Om Prakash, who posed to be his father. On the basis of the IDs, they could have concluded the fact that they are not father-son,” Mujahid’s father Yameen told News18. On Mujahid’s father’s complaint, the Muzaffarnagar Police registered an FIR at Mansurpur Police Station and arrested Om Prakash. “A case has been registered in which a person alleged that he was misled by another person and was made to undergo a sex change surgery. We have registered the case under sections 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 420 (cheating) and 377 (unnatural offence) of IPC. The further investigation is on,” said Ramashish Singh, Circle Officer of Khatauli Police Station in Muzaffarnagar. However, hospital authorities denied Mujahid’s claim that he was deceptively operated on. According to Chief Medical Superintendent Kirti Goswami, the man had been regularly visiting the hospital for two months to meet Dr Raza Farooqui, a plastic surgeon. Goswami stated, “The man identified as a woman and wanted to undergo sex reassignment surgery.” Dr Farooqui said he referred Mujahid to two psychiatrists to assess his mental condition, a legal prerequisite before a sex-change operation. The procedure was performed only after the psychiatrists deemed him mentally fit. “The man came here to get admitted on June 4 and his operation was conducted on June 6. All these procedures are legal and were conducted under the supervision of Dr Farooqui,” Goswami emphasised. Additionally, Goswami claimed that the authorities had a video of the man before his operation, in which he could be seen discussing his desire to undergo gender change surgery. This video, according to Goswami, serves as evidence that Mujahid’s decision was informed and voluntary. The hospital’s stance highlights the legal and procedural adherence throughout the process, contrasting sharply with Mujahid’s allegations of deception."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Shreyanka Mazumdar News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 15:46 IST Mumbai, India Nana Patekar starred in Vidhu Vinod Chopra's Parindey in 1989. Nana Patekar, known for his outstanding roles in films like Parinda and Krantiveer, recently made a comeback with Vivek Agnihotri’s The Vaccine War. Reflecting on his past work, Nana recalled his experience working with Vidhu Vinod Chopra on the film Parinda in 1989, describing it as having “bad memories.” In a candid interview, Nana expressed his discomfort with Vidhu Vinod Chopra, saying, “Every time I meet Vidhu Vinod Chopra, I wish this was our last time”, said Nana in a recent interview.” In an interview with Lallantop, the veteran actor revealed that he doesn’t like Vidhu Vinod Chopra at all. He explained, “I don’t like Vidhu Vinod Chopra. I have no control over my anger. I am still the same. That aspect of my life hasn’t changed yet. Every scene has its setting, tune, and note, there is a way to talk. Now, I don’t know if you watched Parinda, I was in the character, so when the director says, ‘Lights, camera, clap’, if you aggressively say ‘action’, it starts to linger in your ears. It echoes and hurts your ears.” He added, “Let us be in our character please. What happens, when someone shouts, we forget the note that is required for the scene and unknowingly pick director’s note. Just say ‘action’ calmly. Let us get into our character and note. It is because of this we must have had a tiff. I have very bad memories of him (Vidhu Vinod Chopra) and even habits.” Nana then turned to the camera and said directly, “Vidhu, please hear this. I want to tell you all this to your face and not behind your back.” When asked to recall his last meeting with Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Nana said, “Every time I meet him, I wish it to be the last meeting.” “No, seriously”. During the filming of Parinda, there’s a well-known story that has been doing the rounds. It’s said that Vidhu Vinod Chopra had instructed the cast and crew to bring their own food to the set. However, Nana Patekar disagreed and insisted on having food provided on set. This disagreement escalated into an argument between the two, where Patekar verbally abused the director. This angered Vidhu Vinod Chopra, who then tore Nana Patekar’s kurta on set."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Ananya Singh LawBeat Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 15:46 IST New Delhi, India The case involved Muraleedharan K.V. (Respondent), a Deputy Collector who joined government service in 1987 and retired in May 2020. Highlighting the necessity of judicial prudence in handling corruption enquiries, the Kerala High Court has ruled that such unwarranted enquiries can tarnish the careers of public servants. The court, presided over by Justice K. Babu, in response to a petition challenging an order by the Enquiry Commissioner and Special Judge in Thrissur, made the observation that “a Special Judge functioning under the PC Act must be conscious of his responsibilities and obligations. Even an unnecessary preliminary enquiry may cause a blemish in the career of a public servant. Unfortunately, in the present case, the Special Judge was not conscious of his duties and obligations”. The case involved Muraleedharan K.V. (Respondent), a Deputy Collector who joined government service in 1987 and retired in May 2020. During his service, Muraleedharan faced several disciplinary proceedings, which were ultimately closed by the government in July 2022. Following this, he submitted a representation seeking promotion, which he claimed was withheld by certain officials in the General Administration Department, preventing its submission to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). Muraleedharan’s complaint to the Enquiry Commissioner and Special Judge, Thrissur, alleged a conspiracy by several officials, including the then Chief Secretary, V.P. Joy, and others, who he claimed demanded illegal gratification and withheld his promotion file. The special judge, in an order dated October 10, 2023, directed the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) in Thrissur to conduct a quick verification, suspecting a prima facie case of misconduct. Furthermore, the special judge had made adverse comments against IAS officer A. Jayathilak. The state, represented by Special Government Pleader A. Rajesh, argued that Muraleedharan had been considered for promotion to IAS since 1998 but was not recommended by various selection committees due to pending disciplinary proceedings and questions about his integrity. The state highlighted a history of disciplinary actions against him, including penalties and suspensions for various misconducts. It was also argued that Muraleedharan was known for filing frivolous complaints against government officials. The court observed that the special judge had made unwarranted remarks against A. Jayathilak, the then Additional Chief Secretary, without any allegations from Muraleedharan. The court noted: “It is pertinent to note that the respondent/ complainant has not raised any allegation against Shri. A.Jayathilak I.A.S….The unwarranted observations happened to be recorded in the impugned order essentially for the following reasons: (1) The Special Judge erroneously understood the facts (2) The light and casual approach of the Special Judge in dealing with a complaint alleging corruption against public servants.” The HC criticised this approach of the special judge, highlighting the embarrassment it caused to Jayathilak, an extremely honest civil servant. Justice Babu stated, “It is the responsibility of this Court to ensure that a patently erroneous order or observation by the Special Judge does not tarnish the career of an honest civil servant. The observations in the impugned order are liable to be obliterated completely.” The court further emphasised that “simply on a complaint which is not supported by any valid, credible material, an investigation could not be ordered by the Special Courts”. The court concluded that the special judge’s order was “perverse, untenable in law, and, grossly erroneous and glaringly unreasonable.” The court quashed the order and all associated observations, clarifying that Muraleedharan’s allegations of illegal gratification were not credible given his history of disciplinary issues and the lack of a prima facie case."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Aparna Deb News18.com Last Updated: June 18, 2024, 11:42 IST New Delhi, India Out of these 156 helicopters the Defence Ministry is looking to procure, 90 are for the Indian Army, while 66 are for the Indian Air Force. Defence equipment manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics shares gained five per cent in early trade on June 18, after the state-run firm received a ‘Request For Proposal’ from the Ministry of Defence. The scrip surged nearly 6 per cent to its all-time high of Rs 5,484.20 on BSE in Tuesday’s trade. HAL has notified that a RFP has been issued to the company by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) for procurement of 156 LCH Prachand or Light Combat Helicopters (90 for the Indian Army and 66 for the Indian Air Force). As on March 31, 2024, HAL’s order book stood in excess of Rs 94,000 crore with additional major orders expected during FY 2024-25, the company had said on April 1. HAL, with a robust order book and accelerated delivery plan, is expected to sustain and improve the growth trajectory and support the Indian Defence services in their endeavor towards Defence preparedness of the country, the company had said. Meanwhile, the stock is quoting higher for the ninth straight trading day, having rallied 26 per cent during the same period. It has rebounded 40 per cent from a low of Rs 3,918.50 touched on June 5 in the intraday trade. Thus far in the calendar year 2024, the market price of HAL has nearly doubled, zooming 96 per cent. In comparison, the BSE Sensex has gained 6.7 per cent during the period. Estimated value of 156 LCH is Rs 45,000-50,000 crore. The contract will be placed with HAL after the negotiation process. The company has already delivered the initial 15 LCH contract received in FY22. The company’s order backlog (Rs 94000 crore at 3.1x FY24 revenue) and order pipeline remains robust. Including this contract, management has been guiding for order inflows worth Rs 1.6-1.7 trillion in the next 2-3 years where the government has already provided approvals, ICICI Securities said in a note. HAL is engaged in carrying out design, development, manufacture, repair, and overhaul of aircraft, helicopter, engines and related systems like avionics, instruments and accessories primarily serving Indian defence programme. It also manufactures structural parts of various satellite launch vehicles of the Indian Space Research Organization (Isro). The Government of India held majority stake of 71.64 per cent in the company, while 1.89 per cent was held by the Life Insurance Corporation of India as on March 31, 2024. The government’s initiatives for promoting domestic manufacturing and HAL’s established relationship with its customers is expected to continue to benefit HAL in the long run, though there might be some increase in the competition from the private sector. CARE Ratings believes that HAL will continue to benefit from its strategic importance to the Indian defence forces resulting in maintaining its leadership position in the Indian Aerospace and Defence industry supported by long track record of operations and high entry barriers along with maintaining its highly comfortable financial risk profile. On June 14, HAL bagged a ‘buy’ call from Jefferies and a target price of Rs 5,725 apiece, indicating a 12 percent upside potential due to its focus on indigenisation and exports. “We expect HAL to continue double-digit growth for 3-5 years as the sentiment around defence indigenisation and exports remain upbeat. HAL is in a sweet spot as the business has high technology entry barriers,” the brokerage firm said in a recent note. Jefferies also pointed out that current valuations do not fully reflect HAL’s high entry barriers and near-monopoly status."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Aparna Deb News18.com Last Updated: June 18, 2024, 13:25 IST New Delhi, India Paytm Shares of One 97 Communications Ltd (Paytm) surged 4 per cent to Rs 442 in Tuesday’s trade on BSE following reports that the company is in talks with Zomato to sell its movie ticketing business. Zomato shares also rose 1.5 per cent in early trade. The stock will also be in news as Non-Executive Independent Director Neeraj Arora resigned from his position. Paytm appointed Rajeev Krishnamuralilal Agarwal as Non-Executive Independent Director of the company. In the case of Zomato news, Paytm said the potential transfer of Entertainment business, a component of our Marketing Services, is one opportunity under consideration. It had in its recent earnings call said that its focus will be on payment and financial services along with digital goods commerce, which are designed to help merchants scale their businesses. “However, any discussions currently underway are preliminary and do not involve any binding agreements that require approval or disclosure under Regulation 30 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, or other applicable laws. As such, any information pertaining to these discussions should be considered speculative at this time,” Paytm said. If the transaction goes through, it will be among the largest buyouts for Zomato after it acquired Uber Eats in 2020 and took over quick commerce platform Blinkit (formerly Grofers) in 2021 in an all-stock deal valued at Rs 4,447 crore. In the case of Arora’s resignation, Paytm said the resignation was due to pre-occupation and other personal commitments. He will accordingly cease to be a Non Executive Independent Director with effect from closure of business hours on June 17, 2024. Consequently, he will also cease to be a member of the “Nomination and Remuneration Committee” and the “Investment Committee” constituted by the board of Paytm. Agarwal has got wide experience of Securities Markets, Commodity Markets and Taxation. He was Whole Time Member at SEBI for five years. He was also member at Forward Markets Commission, erstwhile regulator of Commodity futures markets, for five and a half years. Paytm shares are up 21 per cent in the past one month. Yet, they are down 34 per cent year-to-date. Commenting on the development, JM Financial BFSI analyst Sameer Bhise said, “Media reports speculate a deal value of Rs 1,500-2,000 crore. While Paytm in its quarterly filings does not disclose revenue or profitability of its events and movie verticals, we estimate total revenue of Rs 275–300 crore for the verticals in FY24. This implies a likely valuation of 5x-7x FY24 sales. Note that the deal would potentially add only around 2.5% to Zomato’s FY24 consolidated revenue. The impact on profitability is difficult to ascertain at the moment as annual subsidiary-level disclosures come with a lag. Zomato’s balance sheet remains healthy to facilitate the deal with a net cash balance of Rs 12,200 crore as of March 2024.”"

The BSE Sensex, which hit an all-time high of 77,852 in the intraday trade, ended mildly higher by 35 points at 77,336 levels. The Nifty50, on the other hand, closed at 23,516, down 42 points. It hit a record high of 23,664 during the day. Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, and SBI, were the top gainers on the 30-stock index, rallying between 1 per cent and 3 per cent. Titan, Maruti Suzuki, L&T, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Reliance Industries, Power Grid, Bajaj Finance, ITC, and HUL, however, weighed on the bourses as they fell up to 3.4 per cent. In the broader markets, the BSE MidCap hit a lifetime high of 46,442.9 in the morning deals, but closed at 45,833.5, down 0.91 per cent. The BSE SmallCap, too, touched a new lifetime summit of 51,968.25 before closing at 51,393, down 0.58 per cent. Among sectors, the Nifty Bank ended 2 per cent higher, hitting a record high of 51,957 intraday. Market View by Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. Higher highs and higher lows are clear indicators of a strong bull rally. This is happening now in the Nifty which has set four days of record highs. Net institutional activity has turned positive with both FIIs and DIIs turning buyers. The US 10-year bond yield declining to 4.21 % may nudge FIIs to buy more. This is pushing FII-heavy stocks like HDFC bank and ICICI bank which have more room to appreciate since their valuations are fair. Global Cues The optimism comes after S&P500, overnight, notched fresh record highs, driven by a rally in Nvidia shares. The broad market index added 0.25 per cent to close at 5,487.03, while the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.03 per cent to end at 17,862.23. The tech-heavy index also closed at a record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.15 per cent to settle at 38,834.86. Meanwhile, markets in Asia Pacific were largely positive Wednesday morning with hang Seng up 1.5 per cent, Kospi 0.9 per cent, and Nikkei 0.5 per cent. ASX200, however, was lower by 0.1 per cent."

    "article_content": "Reported By : Aparna Deb News18.com Last Updated: June 19, 2024, 10:26 IST New Delhi, India Vodafone Idea As much as 20 percent equity stake in Indus Towers was sold in block deals on June 19, with UK’s Vodafone Group being the likely seller. The deals, involving 53.30 crore shares of the mobile tower company was worth a total of Rs 17,065 crore. Following the large deals, shares of Indus Towers fell 6% to Rs 320.60, while Vodafone Idea stock was also trading 1.3% down at Rs 16.64 at the time of writing this article. While Moneycontrol could not immediately identify the parties involved in the transaction, CNBC-TV18 reported citing sources that Vodafone Group was eyeing to offload up to 18 percent stake in Indus Towers. According to reports, private equity firms I Squared Capital and alternative investment firm Stonepeak were among the list of buyers vying for Vodafone’s stake in the mobile tower company. Based on the report, Abhilash Pagaria, Head – Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research, anticipated a float adjustment for Indus Towers in passive indices to take place in the next few days. He estimated a global passive flow impact of $200 million emerging out the float adjustment. As per Pagaria, an inflow of around $130 million is expected through Indus Towers’ float adjustment in the MSCI index and an influx of another $65 million through the changes on the FTSE. It was previously reported that the Vodafone Group was planning to offload a near 10 percent stake in Indus Towers in a bid to raise $1.1 million. Before the transaction, Vodafone PLC held 567.2 million shares or 21% stake in the tower company after it sold a 7.1% stake in early 2022. This could be the second-largest block deal executed in India after the ITC transaction in March, where British American Tobacco Plc (BAT) sold a 3.5% stake in ITC through an open market transaction for around Rs 17,485 crore. Buyers in the block deal will have a lock-in period of 90 days. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, BNP Paribas, and Jefferies are the placement agents for the block deal. Vodafone has been searching for a buyer for the remaining shareholding in the business for years. An agreement with Canadian pension fund fell through in 2022, according to media reports. In February, KKR entity Silverview Portfolio Investments Pte Ltd sold 130.8 million Indus shares, or 4.85%, at Rs 210.21 apiece, aggregating Rs 2,749.61 crore. CPPIB had sold 57.6 million shares or 2.14% in India’s largest telecom tower company at Rs 212.15 apiece, aggregating Rs 1,223.46 crore. Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers merged in late 2020. Airtel is the biggest shareholder in Indus, with 47.95%; Vodafone Group has 21.05%, and 30.97% is with the public, according to the tower company’s latest filing with the BSE. Vi accounts for 35-40% of the tower company’s revenue. Ambit Capital estimates Vi still owes Indus around Rs 10,000 crore. Lately, though, Vi has begun clearing its substantial dues to Indus, boosting the tower company’s net profit in the fiscal third quarter."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Namit Singh Sengar News18.com Last Updated: June 19, 2024, 12:25 IST New Delhi, India Trading in index and stock options has soared in India in the last few years, fueled mainly by retail investors. (Representative image) Options trading is a way of dealing in contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a particular asset (like a stock) at a certain price by a certain time. It’s a bet on the future price movement of the asset. Markets regulator SEBI is looking at ways to make sure options trading is done responsibly and to protect investors from excessive risks. SEBI is concerned about the recent surge in options trading, particularly by retail investors, for a couple of reasons like; Why Options Trading In Radar? What’s the Latest Update? According to a recent report by Reuters, SEBI is considering a series of tweaks to its derivative trading rules, as it seeks to address risks arising from explosive growth in options trading. The report added that the new rules could include higher margins for options contracts and more detailed disclosures, and are being considered after a series of meetings with exchanges, brokers and fund houses over the past four months, the sources told the news agency. Trading in index and stock options has soared in India in the last few years, fueled mainly by retail investors, sparking warnings from market participants and government officials. The notional value of index options traded more than doubled in 2023-24 to $907.09 trillion from the year before. An unchecked explosion in retail trading of futures and options can create future challenges not just for the markets, but for investor sentiment and household finances, India’s federal finance minister warned last month. One source who is a regulatory official told Reuters that there was a need for appropriate risk disclosure and steps to prevent excessive speculation or possible manipulation. The first step the regulator is considering is a linking of options trading with underlying cash volumes in a stock, to contain the build-up of open positions in less liquid stocks, the sources said. In cases where there is excessive build-up of options positions relative to cash volumes, the margin requirement for trading options would increase, they said. Options volumes in India are roughly four-fold underlying cash trading volumes, whereas the global average ranges from 5-15 times. “This ratio has raised concerns,” said the second source. In the United States, the derivatives to cash ratio is about 9 times. SEBI will also suggest increasing disclosures on index and stock options contracts, rather than just options activity and open interest as is now done, the sources said. The regulator is planning to ask exchanges to levy flat fees on brokers regardless of their turnover, the sources said, changing a practice of charging lower transaction fees for brokers with high turnover. Earlier this month, SEBI suggested tighter rules for individual stock derivatives which, if implemented, would weed out derivatives linked to illiquid stocks. The proposed changes are in the discussion stage and will be put up for public consultation over the next few months before they are introduced, the sources said. RISING SPECULATION? Of the 108 billion options contracts traded worldwide in 2023, 78% were on Indian exchanges, according to data from the Futures Industry Association(FIA). Retail investors make up 35% of derivative trading in the country. In April, 78% of trades done on India’s largest exchange, the National Stock Exchange were by investors trading less than 1 million rupees ($11,969). The burst of volumes has created an opportunity for foreign trading firms. U.S.-based Jane Street and Millennium are currently in a legal fight in courts with the former suing the latter for its India options strategy. Jane Street claimed it earned about $1 billion in revenues from the strategy in 2023. As yet, Indian exchanges haven’t launched zero-day expiry options contracts, a popular strategy involving buying an option contract the same day it is set to expire, which helps traders mimic similar contracts offered in markets like the United States. A source familiar with the government’s thinking said that in private conversations, officials have expressed its reservations about a surge in zero-day options trading. This is pure speculation and doesn’t serve any purpose in the market, the source said. The government has also asked the regulator to consider if lot sizes of options contracts can be increased to prevent very small investors from entering the market, this person said. An email sent to India’s finance ministry on Friday seeking comments has not been answered. The rate of growth of options volumes in India is explosive and much higher than anywhere else in the world, Will Acworth, Senior Vice President, Data & Research, FIA said. “The real issue for the government and SEBI is less about risks to the financial systems but more about investor protection,” said Acworth, adding that buying options without fully understanding the product is akin to gambling."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Aparna Deb News18.com Last Updated: June 19, 2024, 13:23 IST New Delhi, India Paytm Shares of Paytm extended losses for a third straight session, falling up to 2.5 percent on June 19, with an Emkay note highlighting risk to customer traffic if a deal with Zomato for the movies and event ticketing business goes through. The domestic brokerage said the entertainment is a high-margin business with a take rate of 5-8 per cent in movies and event ticketing business — a subset of marketing services. This is likely to hit Paytm’s customer traffic, it said. Paytm’s strategy is to focus on the dwindling core business of payments and financial services, post the RBI action. Paytm recently shelved plans to manufacture General Insurance products, and instead is focusing on distribution. Paytm’s subsidiaries Wasteland Entertainment (Paytm Insider) and Orbgen Tech (Ticketnew.com) logged FY23 revenue of Rs 193 crore and Rs 16 crore, leading to marketing/overall revenue share coming in at 14 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively. “Assuming higher revenue of Rs 260 crore in FY24 (factoring in strong traction in 3QFY24), Zomato is reportedly offering higher deal value of Rs 2,000 crore (8x revenue), incl. receivables. The deal would shore-up Paytm’s cash balance (Rs 5,300 crore) and could be used to scale-up rewards/cash-back program to revive its payment business (UPI market share down, to 6 per cent in May 2024 against 10.5 per cent in January 2024),” Emkay Global said. Given the business slowdown, the Paytm management guided an Ebitda loss (exESOP) of Rs 500-600 crore in the June quarter, as the full-quarter impact of business disruption gets absorbed. For now, Emkay Global has retained its ‘Reduce’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 300 per share, given the prolonged business slowdown. In the last year, Paytm stock has plunged over 53 per cent, underperforming benchmark Nifty which delivered returns of 25 per cent during this period."

(X) WWE NXT’s latest episode made a return yesterday, June 4. The show aired live from the company’s performance centre in Florida. The NXT night was advertised to host TNA Knockout’s Champion Jordynne Grace’s debut match against Stevie Turner. Later on the show, the Heritage Cup champion Tony D’Angelo put his trophy on the line against the No Quarter Catch crew’s Damon Kemp. The latest NXT episode also featured a six-man tag-team action match featuring the wrestlers who will compete at the brand’s premium live event Battleground next week. The said clash will be a ladder match for the Women’s NXT North American Championship title. TNA Knockouts Champions Jordynne Grace wins on her debut Jordynne Grace made her appearance on NXT last month as Roxanne Perez’s new title contender for Battleground. Ahead of the championship clash, Grace faced off against Stevie Turner in her debut with NXT. The ex-TNA wrestler dominated the clash with multiple bodyslams. She then hit Tuner with the Vader Bomb before staring down Perez at ringside. Grace then finished off her opponent with the Juggernaut Driver to seal a win. Tony D’Angelo retains his NXT Heritage Cup Tony D’Angelo began his title defence by securing an early fall. He hit Damon Kemp with a Bridging Fisherman Suplex to go 1-0 up. Round two ended without a fall for any wrestlers due to exhaustion of the time limit. The third round witnessed a similar story after Damon landed a Rolling Nothern Lights but failed to capitalise within the time limit. D’Angelo finished off Kemp with another fisherman suplex to retain the NXT Heritage Cup. Ethan Page Becomes Official Member Of The NXT Roster After attacking Trick Williams last month, Ethan Page wanted to have a contract negotiation with the WWE brand in front of the fans. Page got his wish as NXT manager Ava handed the wrestling star a contract inside the ring. Page then signed it and handed it over to the manager while revealing a stipulation that would hand the wrestler a NXT Championship match at Battleground. Ava eventually signs the contract to give Page a title shot. All Results: Jordynne Grace vs Stevie Turner – Jordynne Grace sealed a pinfall victory with the Juggernaut Driver. Jazmyn Nyx vs Thea Hail – Nyx beat Hail by pinfall with a Pele Kick. Damon Kemo vs Tony D’Angelo for the NXT Heritage Cup – Tony D’Angelo won both falls by pinfall to retain the NXT Heritage Cup.

    "article_content": "Published By : Aditi Ray Chowdhury Reuters Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 15:34 IST Seoul, South Korea Live TV footage showed firefighters spraying the damaged steel and concrete building. (Image: Representative/ANI) A powerful explosion set a lithium battery factory on fire in South Korea on Monday, killing at least 16 people, and a search and rescue operation is ongoing for five others who remain missing, local fire officials said. The fire, which has largely been extinguished, ripped through a factory run by battery manufacturer Aricell in Hwaseong, a major industrial cluster about 90 minutes southwest of the capital Seoul. The blaze began after a series of battery cells exploded inside a warehouse with some 35,000 units, said Kim Jin-young, a local fire official. What had triggered the explosion remains unclear, he added. A Reuters witness saw firefighters moving up to six bodies out of the factory. Due to the intensity of the blaze, rescuers were finding it difficult to identify the dead, Kim added. Yonhap news agency had earlier reported that some 20 bodies had been found inside the plant, but Kim told a televised briefing that 16 people had died and two others were suffering from burns and other serious injuries. He said rescuers were inside the factory trying to find the five people unaccounted for. Kim Jae-ho, Fire and Disaster Prevention professor at Daejeon University, said the fire had probably spread too quickly for workers to escape. ”Battery materials such as nickel are easily flammable,” he said. ”So often, there is not enough time to respond, compared to a fire caused by other materials.” President Yoon Suk Yeol was monitoring the situation, his office said, while Interior Minister Lee Sang-min called on the local authorities to take steps to prevent any hazardous chemicals from contaminating the surroundings. Established in 2020, Aricell makes lithium primary batteries for sensors and radio communication devices. It has 48 employees, according to its latest regulatory filing and its Linkedin profile. Calls to Aricell offices were unanswered. The company is not listed on South Korea’s stock market but is majority owned by S-Connect, according to Aricell regulatory filing. S-Connect is registered on the junior Kosdaq index and its shares closed down 22.5%. Live TV footage showed firefighters spraying the damaged steel and concrete building. Parts of the upper level had collapsed, and large chunks of the building looked like they had been blown out into the street by an explosion. South Korea, a major industrial economy, has made efforts to improve its safety record after several past accidents, many of which have been blamed on negligence."

    "article_content": "Published By : Siddarth Sriram PTI Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 07:00 IST Saint Lucia Mohammed Siraj for India (AFP) A lot more spice has been added to the India-Australia contest here on Monday after the latter’s loss to Afghanistan and the local curators feel playing three spinners would be a tad too much on what has proved to be the best batting strip in the T20 World Cup. India have been playing an extra spinner in Kuldeep Yadav since the start of the Super Eights and after picking five wickets from three games, Rohit Sharma is unlikely to bench him. The other spin options are all-rounders Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja. A day before the game that can potentially knock Australia out of the tournament, members of the groundstaff wanted to see Mohammed Siraj back in the side to support Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh at the expense of a spinner. The main square has six black soil pitches and number three would be in use for the day game on Monday. “The pitch is nice and hard, should stay the same throughout in a day game. Whichever team bats should score 180 to 200. I prefer to bat and put runs on the board. England batted poorly. The pitch got a bit tricky and the ball was not coming on,” said a member of the groundstaff at the Darren Sammy Stadium. West Indies scored 218, the highest total of the tournament thus far, in a day-night game with light dew making batting easier. In the only day game held before, South Africa were able to defend 163 against England. “It gets drier in a day game when the sun is out, it would be a good game tomorrow. Here we don’t get much spin. We get nice bounce but not a lot of spin on this black soil pitch. I would play an extra pacer. The surface is more suited to the pacers and has consistent pace and bounce. “Bowlers will need to bowl well else they get punished,” said another member of the groundstaff. It is to be noted that in the England-South Africa day game, the spinners did alright with Keshav Maharaj taking a couple of wickets for the Proteas. Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali picked one each. The top dressing of the main square was done five months ago as part of World Cup preparations. Sri Lanka had also managed to amass 201 against Netherlands here. The wind factor will be here too like it was in Barbados and Antigua. India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey said ahead of the game, “The breeze and the wind has been a factor in the last two games. So obviously, you plan certain ends. You will want any particular bowler – you’ve got to look at your best match-up and say which is the best end for the particular bowler. “But it’s not going to be possible every time. You still sometimes have to come and bowl from the difficult end, which Arsh did in the last game. Barbados was different when he bowled from a difficult end. “You’ve got to be able to do that. It’s not only possible each and every time, but you need to consider the surface, the conditions while implementing your plans.” Stay updated with the latest from T20 World Cup 2024 .

(AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa) India vs Australia in T20 World Cup 2024 Group 1 Super 8 fixture at the Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, St Lucia will most likely ensure on of the two teams from the Group a place in the semi-final today before Afghanistan take on Bangladesh. However, there now seems to be a big question mark on the match itself with the weather prediction for the game being a bit of an iffy affair. If India win against Australia, they will make it to the semi-final by virtue of finishing top of the table. But, if Australia manage to win, they will keep their chance of semi-final qualification alive, but they will be nervously awaiting the outcome of the Bangladesh vs Afghanistan fixture. Australia have to beat India at any cost to make the semis and a loss will dent their chances. But, there is heavy rain prediction at St Lucia on matchday, and that makes things tricky, for Australia especially. IND vs AUS, St Lucia Weather Live Updates: India vs Australia Super 8 Match Could be a Washout? There is a 51 percent chance of rain at 10 AM local time (half an hour before the match). A washout will not be good for Australia. If that happens, both teams (India and Australia) will split points – one each. India with 5 points will ensure a semis spot, but Australia will be stuck at 3 points and then the equation for Afghanistan will be simple: Win against Bangladesh a book their semis spot. No NRR will come into play If Afghanistan beat Bangladesh, they will have four points and will advance to the semi-finals with India. In case of rain, the only way for Australia to reach the semi-finals is if Bangladesh defeats Afghanistan. In that scenario, Bangladesh and Afghanistan will each have two points, and India (5 points) and Australia (3 points) will advance to the semi-finals. There is no reserve day for Super 8 matches. There will be a reserve day for the first semi-final, while there is no reserve day for the second semi-final to be played in Guyana. Stay updated with the latest from T20 World Cup 2024 .

(AP) Jasprit Bumrah has so far been untouchable in the 2024 T20 World Cup, picking up 10 wickets and that too at an economy of just 3.42 runs per over. The fast bowler’s performances have greatly contributed to India’s unbeaten run in the tournament and ahead of the last Super 8 clash against Australia, Piyush Chawla and Paul Collingwood feel Bumrah can be the difference between the two sides. Unbeaten India prepare for the #SuperRivalry #INDvAUS | #FollowTheBlues | #T20WorldCupOnStar https://t.co/Pdzp6t03Xu — Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) June 23, 2024 Former India spinner Chawla said that the pitch does not matter for Bumrah as the Indian pacer has the arsenal to utilise every playing condition. “Whenever he steps onto the field, he brings his A-game out. And we have seen what he can do with the ball surface doesn’t matter for him because we have seen what he has done in the US where the wickets were seaming around and when we came to the Caribbean, the way he bowled, he used the pitch really well with the good effect. He used his cutters and then his pace-on deliveries and he’s somebody who can bowl yorkers at will. But he knows when there is something in the pitch for the bowler and he didn’t even try to use those yorkers against Bangladesh. Those four overs are very, very crucial,” Chawla was quoted as saying on Star Sports.

He is the person who would be on any team sheet. He is somebody who can take a lot of wickets. And I think when you’ve got a player like that in your rank and bowl four overs; I think Australia are probably in a little bit of trouble. I can imagine that he would be putting them under a serious amount of pressure, but it’s going to be a great one to watch,” Paul Collingwood was quoted as saying on Star Sports.

The defending champion crushed the United States by 10 wickets with 62 balls remaining in their last Super Eight game. Jordan grabbed four wickets off five balls in his last over to dismantle the USA for 115 runs in 18.5 overs and become the first Englishman to claim a hat trick in T20Is. He began the 19th over by having Corey Anderson caught at long-on by Harry Brook. Two balls later he clean bowled Ali Khan, then trapped Nosthush Kenjige lbw and bowled Saurabh Netravalkar to complete his hat-trick, all three falling without scoring.

Obviously, the hat trick is definitely a special one. I will come on to that in a second, but I thought the team performance was really solid today. The way we set the tone in the power play. We knew they were going to come hard, played a few good shots, but then the way Liam and Rash controlled things for us in the middle, just set up things nicely for us at the back end and we were able to reap the rewards,” Jordan said at the post-match press conference. “But to get that hat trick, obviously in a well-documented place that I was born, a place that I played so much cricket, in front of my family, my friends, the atmosphere, hearing the music going, everything, a nice day. Yeah, it was a special one,” he added.

I think having gone through it in the last World Cup that we won as well . I think it is standing us in good stead because there was not too much panic in when I think it was the Ireland game and they ended up winning on Duckworth Lewis and then we had to be in a position where we had to win every game after that,” he said. “But I think the calmness within the dressing room, the dressing room has a lot of experience now, both in the playing 15 and also off the field as well. So, we’ve had some really good chats. And I think the scenarios that we found ourselves in, where we had to get our run rate up and stuff like that, and try to beat people and really dominate games, really gave us some really clear direction. I think you are seeing that in the way we are playing now,” Jordan added. (With inputs from Agencies) Stay updated with the latest from T20 World Cup 2024 . Explore T20 World Cup Match Today .

Buttler’s unbeaten 83 off 38 balls helped England defeat co-hosts USA by 10 wickets in Barbados. England had to win the game in 18.4 overs to ensure that their net run rate was above that of South Africa. It would have also confirmed England’s direct qualification into the semis and Buttler did exactly that. Buttler was in majestic form against the USA and his power-packed knock comprised seven sixes. Buttler did not take much time to get in the groove and in the third over of the game the English skipper was found hitting two back-to-back marvellous maximums facing USA’s left-arm pacer Saurabh Netravalkar.

(AP Photo) USA fast bowler Ali Khan recently shared his thoughts about the historic win over Pakistan in the T20 World Cup. It was no doubt a monumental achievement for the USA who debuted in the tournament this year on home soil. The co-hosts kicked off the campaign in style, beating Canada by seven wickets. They were up against Pakistan in the following game, which turned out to be a nail-biting encounter. Both teams produced 159, forcing a Super Over where the USA notched a five-run win. Khan, who was part of the victorious unit, talked about the match during a recent interview with former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif on Times of Karachi. India Aur Pakistan Mai Sy Hum Nay Pakistan Pick Ki Jis Ko Hum Gira Saktay Hain, said USA fast bowler Ali Khan @IamAlikhan23 @iRashidLatif68 @DrNaumanNiaz @krick3r #CaughtBehimd #RashidLatif #AliKhan #PAKvUSA #T20WorldCup2024 pic.twitter.com/0ppK1GLnpK — Times of Karachi (@TOKCityOfLights) June 22, 2024 Rashid Latif revealed that the people of Pakistan were unhappy with Ali Khan, who has his roots in the country. The USA cricketer said that those fans would have been more disappointed if he had “bowled the Super Over.” “I am thankful that they didn’t ask me to bowl that over. Otherwise, I won’t be able to come to Pakistan again. It was a very emotional game as Pakistan is a big team. We never played against them earlier and then we got that in the World Cup. They have some big names like Babar Azam, (Mohammed) Rizwan, Fakhar Zaman and Shaheen Afridi,” Khan explained. ALSO READ | Naveen-Ul-Haq Takes a Cheeky Dig Hinting Lack of Support After Afghanistan Beat Australia in T20 World Cup According to Ali Khan, they got a huge confidence boost after defeating Bangladesh in a bilateral T20I series ahead of the World Cup. The fast bowler further revealed that the USA were confident about beating Canada and Ireland in the league stage of the T20 World Cup. “When it came to India and Pakistan, we had to pick one side to bear and it was Pakistan. We had our plans set and once we stepped onto the field, we executed our plans very well,” he said. Ali Khan feels the Pakistan unit failed to showcase their A-game in the match in New York. “If you see Pakistan’s history, either they will destroy you or they will get destroyed by their own. We were lucky that day,” he added. After winning two matches in the group stage, the USA qualified for the Super 8 round while Pakistan finished third in the table. The American side, however, could not continue the momentum afterwards. They lost to England, South Africa and West Indies in the Super 8 stage and were knocked out of the tournament.

    "article_content": "Curated By : Siddarth Sriram News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 12:36 IST New Delhi, India Tabraiz Shamsi wreaked havoc over the West Indies batters, registering a magical spell of 3/27 (AP) It was a rollercoaster ride till the very end, but South Africa weathered a literal and metaphorical storm against the West Indies to clinch a 3-wicket win and seal their spot in the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup 2024. SA skipper Markram won the toss and, in an unexpected turn of events, sent the West Indies out to bat first. The move came as a surprise for many, knowing that the Proteas have clinched 4 out of 4 wins in their campaign so far after having batted first. But, it wouldn’t matter much for Markram and his men soon enough. Opening the innings for the West Indies, Shai Hope went down along with the hopes of his side early on, as the swashbuckling batter was dismissed for a golden duck by Jansen with the third delivery of the first over. The misery would only pile on though, as Markram, who took the ball next, also struck instantly, removing the swashbuckling Pooran for a mere run, and it all seemed bleak for the hosts. South Africa was running high, and Roston Chase stepped up to break the deadlock with a couple of blitzing boundaries to get off the mark and ease the pressure. But, South Africa would almost strike again, tempting Chase to sky one high, only for Nortje to drop the catch and provide another life for Chase — a mistake South Africa would go on to regret. Chase, alongside opener Kyle Mayers, took the attack to South Africa, swiping away at boundaries galore, as the duo rebuilt their side’s innings in fine fashion, bringing them up from 5/2 to 69/2 by the halfway mark. South Africa would not fold though, as they turned the tide around with the introductions of spinners Shamsi and Maharaj. Shamsi, in particular, would run riot over the West Indians, dazzling with perfect line and composure, to scalp both the dangerous Mayers and Sherfane Rutherford in quick succession, before finally removing the dangerman Chase after he reached his fifty. In a seemingly bizarre move, Rabada wouldn’t be introduced to bowl till the 18th over. But, the move turned out to be one of brilliance as his introduction would lead to the immediate dismissals of both Andre Russell and Akeal Hosein in the same over, as West Indies went down 8 wickets. All-in-all, a spirited fight from the tail-enders would help the West Indies muster up 135 runs, leaving it all up to South Africa to take the win, if they so please. And it sure seemed like they wanted the win bad, as Quinton de Kock got off to a blazing start, punishing Akeal Hosein for three fours in the very first over itself. But, cometh the hour cometh the man, as Andre Russell stepped up with the ball to scalp both de Kock and his strike partner Reeza Hendricks in the same over, pushing South Africa to a cautious 15/2, right before rains stopped play. The consistent showers could have rained on the West Indies’ hopes had the match been abandoned, but lucky for them, a revised target of 123 from 17 overs was set for South Africa. Stubbs, the new man in, instantly went to work, slashing for boundaries, as Hosein failed to inspire any change. But, one man who would end up doing so, would be Alzarri Joseph. The pacer instantly found the breakthrough for West Indies, removing Markram and then the hard-hitting Klaasen after he went on an onslaught of Motie, to swing momentum back towards the hosts. A spirited spell from the likes of Andre Russell and Alzarri Joseph ensued, as the pace dup kept a patient Stubbs at bay, wringing the game out. The biggest twist in the tale was yet to come, and it occurred with the introduction of off-spinner Roston Chase. Chase, in classic fashion this tournament, choked out the Proteas batters, keeping his lines tight, and turned the game around once again, when he claimed the wickets of David Miller and most importantly, Tristan Stubbs, who fell victim in the 14th over. The momentum had completely turned around to favour the hosts, as the crowds roared them on, and South Africa kept it close, inching towards the target through the storm with Marco Jansen and Keshav Maharaj at the crease. Needing 13 runs from 12 balls, Chase was entrusted with the ball one last time, and he delivered again, removing Maharaj and piling the pressure onto Jansen and new man Rabada. But, the ace pacer Rabada kept his cool to drive confidently for a stellar four to end the over, and needing 5 to win from the last over, Jansen finished it off in style, pummelling McCoy for a six straight down the ground to seal the deal. With their win, South Africa now joins England as the semi-final qualifiers from Super Eight Group 2. Stay updated with the latest from T20 World Cup 2024 . Explore T20 World Cup Match Today .

Naib claimed 4-20 and Naveen-ul-Haq bagged 3-20, but it was the third century partnership of the tournament from Gurbaz and Zadran that laid the foundation for a win that also kept Bangladesh alive.

The unbeaten Proteas joined England in the last four as Group 2 winners when Marco Jansen (21 not out) smashed a six down the ground off the first ball of the final over to get South Africa to their adjusted target of 123.

In the 2023 ODI World Cup, Pat Cummins-led Australia defeated India by six wickets in the final to lift their sixth title.

In the ongoing T20 World Cup, India remain unbeaten with five consecutive wins, including two in Super Eight matches against Afghanistan and Bangladesh respectively. “Playing against Australia in the upcoming T20 World Cup is going to be very emotional. I know how much this match means to the team and the fans, especially after our loss to them in the ODI World Cup at home. It will be more than just a game; it will be a chance for redemption and to show our resilience. “The way we have been playing in the tournament till now has surely boosted the confidence of the players before the highly awaited clash of titans.

Our playing 11 needs to be well-balanced, with a mix of pace and spin to exploit these conditions. Australian batters are aggressive and pose a real threat, but we can counter that with disciplined bowling. It’s essential for our bowlers to maintain tight lines and lengths, vary their pace, and make smart use of the conditions,” he said. “Spinners can play a key role by targeting the middle overs to break partnerships and keep the pressure on.

West Indies were sent out to bat first, by Aiden Markram. Despite a horror start, leaving them at 5/2, Roston Chase stepped up when he was needed the most, and piled on 52 runs to power his side to a subpar total of 135 runs. After a couple of overs into the chase from SA, consistent showers ensued, which could have rained on the West Indies’ hopes had the match been abandoned, but lucky for them, a revised target of 123 from 17 overs was set for South Africa. Powell’s men fought till the very end, as the West Indies pushed South Africa to the brink of elimination with a clinical bowling showcase, but Marco Jansen weathered the literal and metaphorical storm to lead the Proteas to a 3-wicket win in the last over. “Credit to the boys for fighting till the end. As a batting group this is a performance we want to forget, we didn’t bat well in the middle overs. We lost wickets in clusters and that always breaks the back of the batting team. It was a commendable effort,” stated skipper Rovman Powell in a post-match interview. For Powell though, as heartbreaking as the loss was, the bigger picture proved to be one of victory, for West Indies cricket witnessed a revival through the tournament. After years of losing their standard and fans in the international level, hosting the T20 World Cup and the performance of the national team ensured that the Caribbean was yet again reminded of the gentleman’s game. “We haven’t won the World Cup or reached the semifinal but we have played some good cricket in the last 12 months. There is a buzz among the supporters about West Indies cricket again and that is something we take away. We really appreciate the support we have got,” stated a proud Powell.

A1 team India— Shelender Bishnoi (@ShelenderB44581) June 24, 2024 India and Australia have emerged as two of the best teams in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024. Both sides finished their groups undefeated to book a place in the Super Eight. In this stage, India won their previous matches against Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Whereas, Australia conceded a shocking loss to the Rashid Khan-led side. Now the semi-final qualification of both teams will be at stake in the upcoming game. India’s couple of victories give them a decent safety net whereas Australia will likely be on wafer-thin ice if they concede a second-straight loss. Australia skipper Mitchell Marsh recognises the challenge ahead of them. As per ESPNcricinfo, this is what he said about the upcoming clashing in a recent interview – We have a lot of belief in our group. We are a very good cricket team. Yes, tonight we had an off night but I guess there’s also a positive in the fact that in 36 hours we go again. It’s a big game, it will be against India, obviously, and it’s a must-win game. I think if you look back at the short history of this team, I know for a fact that it brings out the best in our guys, so the boys will certainly be up and about for it.” Stay updated with the latest from T20 World Cup 2024 .

    "article_content": "Published By : Nibandh Vinod Trending Desk Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 07:00 IST West Indies won their second consecutive ODI World Cup trophy on this day 46 years ago. (Image: @ICC/X, formerly Twitter) The West Indies cricket team established their supremacy by winning their second consecutive ODI World Cup trophy 46 years back on this day. Having won the inaugural edition of the tournament at the iconic Lord’s in 1975, the Caribbean side was the favourites to win back-to-back two crowns four years later. With Sir Clive Lloyd handling the leadership duties, the West Indies faced England in the 1979 ODI World Cup final in London on June 23. Sir Viv Richards put on a batting masterclass to light up the sport’s ultimate game. He produced one of the finest individual displays in ODI history to help the West Indies seal the trophy once again. Batting first, the West Indies posted a solid total of 286. West Indies batting was spearheaded by star batter Sir Vivian Richards. West Indies’ opening pair of Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes departed early. Greenidge was dismissed for nine while, Haynes lost his wicket to Chris Old. Seeing West Indies in early danger, Richards took it upon himself to anchor the innings by racking up a monumental century. Collis King also played a crucial knock by following a different approach. While his teammate Sir Viv Richards calmly collected boundaries, King was on the offense right from the get-go. He smashed a 66-ball 86 while hitting 10 boundaries and three sixes. He was dismissed by Phil Edmonds but it was too late for the Englishmen. In the second innings, England began their run chase in a methodical and controlled manner. They did not lose a single wicket until the 129-run mark. England, however, were slowly running out of deliveries to reach the target. England skipper Mike Brearley was the first batter to depart for his side, losing his wicket to Michael Holding. The West Indies pacer added another soon, dismissing Geoff Boycott for 57. The Caribbean duo of Colin Croft and Joel Garner joined the action to scalp the remaining eight wickets. Garner picked five of them to bowl out England for 194, sealing a 92-run victory for West Indies. Michael Holding contributed significantly by picking up two wickets in the 1979 World Cup final against England. Stay updated with the latest from T20 World Cup 2024 .

    "article_content": "Reported By : Sahil Malhotra News18.com Last Updated: June 20, 2024, 19:16 IST New Delhi, India Hanuma Vihari (PTI Photo) Hanuma Vihari will not move to Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association for the upcoming domestic season and the India cricketer informed has about his decision to head coach Chandrakant Pandit this morning. “He has backed out. I got a message this morning that he will not be playing for us. It’s unfortunate but we can’t help it,” says Pandit. It’s been more than two weeks since Vihari got a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Andhra Cricket Association (ACA) which he didn’t submit to MPCA. MPCA office bearers kept waiting for the paperwork to complete all formalities but it never came their way. Coach Pandit too tried establishing contact with Vihari for the last 4-5 days but the right-hander only called back last evening. “I have been trying to speak to him for the last 5-6 days but wasn’t able to talk. I then dropped him a message and he called back last evening and said he would update me. This morning I got a message from him that he will not be able to play for us,” adds Pandit. As reported by CricketNext earlier, MP were considering Vihari for the leadership role but his last-moment back out hasn’t gone down well with the officials. Especially because it has happened for two consecutive years and it was Vihari who had reached out to Pandit after his rift with Andhra Cricket Association officials during the 2023-24 season. Vihari had tweeted about getting NOC after a long delay but neither the tweet nor the NOC is available on his timeline. “It has happened for two consecutive years now and it’s very unfortunate. Everyone in the association was prepared to have him but the last moment back out, again, isn’t good,” says Pandit. Vihari didn’t respond to CricketNext’s messages and had earlier refused to comment on the developments. It is not clear at this stage whether Vihari stays back at Andhra but those close to developments feel the political developments in the region could have forced the batter to change his mind. “Not entirely sure what is going in his mind but he could well stay back at Andhra after recent political developments. If he has deleted his NOC means he is staying back at Andhra only,” says a source tracking developments. Stay updated with the latest from T20 World Cup 2024 . Explore T20 World Cup Match Today .

    "article_content": "Reported By : Sahil Malhotra News18.com Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 18:23 IST New Delhi, India Mohammad Shami has resumed bowling after being away from action since India's loss to Australia in ODI World Cup Final Mohammad Shami has resumed bowling at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) but it’s difficult to put a date on his India return at this stage. The seamer underwent surgery on his right Achilles tendon in February and is undergoing rehab under the watch of Dr Nitin Patel (Head of Sports Science and Medicine at NCA) and Strength & Conditioning coach Rajinikanth at the NCA. Shami has just taken a break but is likely to return to Bengaluru very soon to resume his rehabilitation. His childhood coach Badruddin is very pleased with the seamer’s progress but feels it will take some more time before he is ready to make a comeback. “Shami has started bowling. Not with full run-up or full tilt but has started releasing the ball without any discomfort in the nets. This is a good sign because bowling activity has begun,” says Badruddin. Shami last played for India on November 19 in the 2023 World Cup final vs Australia in Ahmedabad and has been away from action since then. He has missed the South Africa tour, the home Test series vs England, the 2024 edition of the Indian Premier League and the ongoing T20 World Cup. A post shared by (@mdshami.11) India’s home calendar was released by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Thursday and the Men in Blue will host Bangladesh for two Tests and 3 T20Is in September-October. Secretary Jay Shah had said in March that they are targeting the Bangladesh Tests for Shami’s return but more clarity on the return date will happen only when he resumes bowling full tilt. “No doubt he will be back in India colours very soon. You would have seen the progress he has been making via the social media videos and the post. He is working very hard but more clarity will come when bowling resumes at full tilt and how the body reacts after that,” says a source close to the cricketer. The NCA, as they did with Rishabh Pant, Jasprit Bumrah, KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer, prefers the shorter formats for players who have undergone long rehabs and it’s very likely to be the case with Shami too as he hasn’t played any cricket for over six months now. Before the Bangladesh Tests, India will tour Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka in July for limited-overs fixtures and it remains to be seen whether the 33-year-old can get the Return to Play (RTP) before any of those assignments. Zimbabwe looks unlikely as of now and if he doesn’t regain complete match fitness before the Sri Lanka tour, the three T20Is vs Bangladesh in October are also being looked at for a potential return. The return during Bangladesh Tests is not completely ruled out yet but the stakeholders don’t want to risk injecting him directly into Tests. “There is a very important away tour of Australia this year where India play five Tests. Mohammed Shami is going to be a very crucial player for the side during that assignment and a very cautious approach is going to be followed. NCA has used T20I and ODIs for players returning from long injury lay-offs in the past and the route is likely to be followed with Shami too. “It is always better to ease a player back into competitive cricket, especially for a fast bowler. Again, that’s a safety-first plan but you never know. If he bowls without discomfort for an extended period in the nets and participates in match simulations without any trouble, Bangladesh Tests could well be the series of his return,” says a well-placed source. Shami has been working hard on his fitness and a range of mobility exercises have been included in his routine. A lot of focus is being given to core activation, strength building and compound movements, and substantial progress has been made by the seamer who wasn’t able to walk without crutches some time back.

A post shared by Rishabh Pant (@rishabpant) In fact, India inched closer to a semi-final berth in the T20 World Cup having won their first two games in the Super 8 stage.

Bangladesh were never really in the chase and managed 146/8 in reply, succumbing to their second Group 1 defeat to be on the brink of elimination. Electing to field, Bangladesh began with spin from both ends but quickly abandoned the novelty after the first two overs yielded 23 runs and no wicket. Shakib Al Hasan bore the brunt of the assault but redeemed himself by ending the 39-run opening stand between India skipper Rohit Sharma (23) and stalwart Virat Kohli (37). Rohit offered a skyer to perish but Kohli smacked three sixes before Tanzim Hasan triggered a mini-collapse in the eventful ninth over. The pacer splattered Kohli’s stumps, had his next ball hit for a six by Suryakumar Yadav, and was celebrating the wicket of India’s number three batter in the following delivery.

Pandya then returned to break the opening stand when Bangladesh began their chase. The seamer had Litton Das caught in the deep before spinner Kuldeep Yadav claimed three quick wickets to effectively derail Bangladesh’s chase. Both Tanzid Hasan (29) and Towhid Hridoy (4) fell lbw to the left-arm wrist spinner, who also removed Shakib and finished with figures of 3-19.

    "article_content": "Published By : Feroz Khan PTI Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 21:47 IST Bengaluru, India India were a class apart. (BCCI Photo) Smriti Mandhana waltzed to a characteristically elegant 90 to form the crux of India’s six-wicket win in the third and final women’s ODI against South Africa, marking their 3-0 series clean sweep in Bengaluru on Sunday. Mandhana, whose innings came off 83 balls (11×4), had efficient support casts in Shafali Verma (25), Priya Punia (28) and Harmanpreet Kaur (42, 48b, 2×4) as India went past the target of 216 without exerting themselves much. The hosts made 220 for four in 40.4 overs, after South Africa were restricted to an underwhelming 215 for eight despite skipper Laura Wolvaardt’s solid 61 (57b, 7×4). Though she failed to make a third hundred on the bounce, the knock underlined the way Mandhana dominated this ODI series, scoring 343 runs at an average of 114.33. The 27-year-old was once again composed in the middle, and played some typically graceful shots around the Chinnaswamy stadium. The pitch was smoothened out during the chase and the SA bowling was anything but threatening, giving the Indian vice-captain ample time to pursue her game without an iota of pressure. On view were those trademark shots that make her batting a sight for the sore eyes – swivel pulls, cover drives, straight drives and those late taps that touch the rope after teasing the third man fielder. However, Mandhana’s batting partners too deserved a pat on their backs for producing little yet polished knocks. Shafali helped her make 61 runs in 11.5 overs for the opening wicket, while Priya, who is playing an ODI for the first time since 2019, assisted her in amassing 62 runs in 66 balls for the second wicket. Skipper Harmanpreet was fluent during the unbeaten third wicket stand that was worth 54 runs. But the vociferous, highly-partisan crowd that touched 15000 could not see a popular Mandhana century, as her attempt to sweep left-arm spinner Nonku Mlaba ended in the hands of Ayabonga Khaka. Earlier, the Indian bowlers showed an unbending will to restrict South Africa to 215 for eight after the visitors raced to 102 without loss in 19.5 overs. Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits (38, 66b, 2×4, 1×6) negated Indian bowlers during their first-wicket alliance as SA looked set for a big total that could have given them a chance to register a consolation win. Both Wolvaardt and Brits were comfortable against the Indian bowlers even though there was a hint of varied bounce, which was evident when pacer Pooja Vastrakar beat the defence of Sune Luus (13) with a delivery that stayed close to her ankle. However, the SA openers found a way to tackle that, as they hardly opted for aerial shots and collected their runs more pragmatically with singles, twos and the occasional power shots. Brits’ six off left-arm spinner Radha Yadav over mid-wicket following a little shimmy down the track was the lone moment of explosion. At the other end, Wolvaardt maintained a strike-rate of over 100 without ever really taking undue risks. The tourists crossed the 100-run mark in the 18th over but their fortunes turned around when pacer Arundhati Reddy pulled off an excellent return catch to dismiss a set Wolvaardt. Arundhati later produced an even better caught and bowled effort to jettison Anneke Bosch as India twisted the knife through SA’s batting unit under Arundhati (2/36) and off-spinner Deepti Sharma (2/27), who was hard to score off. However, South Africa also had their own indiscretions to blame for the downfall. Brits and Nondumise Shangase (16) charged out for non-existing singles to get run out just when they were looking to upshift the gears. The Proteas lost eight wickets for 113 runs in that period and it was always going to be too deep an abyss for them to climb back. Stay updated with the latest from T20 World Cup 2024 .

Team India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey said that the “implementation of plans” against Australia will be key as Rohit Sharma and Co. eye a spot in yet another ICC tournament. “We played them initially. Earlier, a lot of these guys have played against them. A lot of guys have played in the IPL. So, in terms of knowing of the game, the approach that is going to change has been similar in the past games that we played. I don’t think it’s going to change. I think it’s all what we can do is really focus on the implementation of our plans,” Mhambrey said at the pre-match press conference. “And the bottom line is execution. I think if you’re as close to execution, you will win every game. So, it’s not about what the other opponent’s going to do yet. We know what kind of approach they come with. That’s the way they played in the past as well. But I think the focus purely should be on, that’s what we will focus on in execution. And if we’re as close to our plans, I’m pretty sure that we’re going to cross the other side,” he added.

When asked about Kuldeep’s performance so far, Mhambrey said: “He’s always been a class bowler, he’s always done well for us, always won games for us initially as well. But unfortunately, because of the kind of wickets that we played in the US, he couldn’t get an opportunity, couldn’t get a run. But good to see that he’s come out the last two games, he’s done well. This was fabulous. I think he really bowled well, used the conditions very well and yeah, good to see that he’s got in the run.” ALSO READ | ‘IPL is Totally Different, Boss…Not The Same Experience’: Kuldeep Yadav on Role of IPL Leading up to T20 World Cup Campaign When asked about if India would look to field four spinners, Mhambrey clarified that the pitch would dictate such calls. “It all depends on what surface – I hope the surface won’t be that spinner friendly I think going in yes three spinners, I think just add the balance but I’m not very sure all the other venues – in case, I’m saying I don’t look like the surface is going to be that dry and going to turn so much but yeah if the surface is like that, there’s a lot of wear and tear in the wicket yeah for a spinner if you think that’s the best option you want to go and enter the game, you might as well go with it,” Mhambrey said.

As the Indian cricket team ready for the match against Australia, bowling coach Paras Mhambrey asserted that the pair’s contribution are not be measured by just runs. “I think Virat has been – in the past, we’ve seen from the IPL itself and Rohit from the World Cup. I think both of them in great form. I think every game there is a certain plan that you go in with. Sometimes some individual has to take a chance, the other has to play a defending role. So, I think that’s going to happen out here, that’s what is happening. Rohit is playing his natural game,” the bowling coach said at the pre-match press conference. “But it’s good to see that in this game especially, the intent that Virat has shown, I think that’s good to see that, good to see that intent. And I think, performance – you’ll have games like this, you’ll get a 40-odd, 50-odd run, but I think the way he went about with the intent, that was good to see. That was good-hearted. And I think that’s the intent that we want as a batting unit as well. Something that we’ve been emphasizing throughout the previous World Cup, and this World Cup as well. I think if you do not show the intent it’s good to see that intent on the ground today,” he added.

Paras Mhambrey though is not quite counting out the all-rounder’s capabilities with the ball in hand. “See first of all, we always knew that Shivam adds bowling, maybe one or two overs. It depends on the situation where and how we can use it. But as long as right now, currently, with three seamers doing their job with three spinners, it’s difficult to get him over or so. But one thing that we’re definitely doing is working in the nets, consistently working on the bowling. The conversations is going, still have those kind of conversation knowing that maybe in a game going ahead, one of the games he will play a critical role. Maybe only six balls, maybe only over, but that will be very important over for us. So, preparation is going on. I think he’s in the right frame of mind. He’s working on his bowling, so good to see that. But if the situation does arise, I’m sure he’s prepared for it,” he said. Stay updated with the latest from T20 World Cup 2024 .

A 34-year-old hiker was rescued in the US state of California after being stranded in the mountains for 10 days, surviving on wild berries and one gallon of water daily. Lukas McClish set out for a three-hour hike in the Santa Cruz Mountains on June 11 but lost his way due to landmarks destroyed by recent wildfires. His family reported him missing on June 16, prompting a multi-day search. There were multiple reports of “witnesses hearing someone yelling” for help, but the location was hard to establish. McClish was spotted on Thursday by a drone from the Santa Cruz Sheriff’s Office in the forest between Empire Grade Road and the Big Basin Highway. He was found with no major injuries and reunited with his family, described by the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office as a successful team effort.

In an interview with a local ABC News outlet, McClish recounted hiking with minimal gear — just pants, hiking shoes, a hat, a flashlight, and a Leatherman tool. He survived by drinking water collected in his boot, ensuring he consumed a gallon each day. However, nearing the end, his body needed sustenance beyond water. Reflecting on his ordeal, McClish expressed gratitude for the rescue teams and described the experience as humbling and awe-inspiring. After the ordeal left him tired and sore, he indicated he would likely avoid wilderness activities for the remainder of the year."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Lifestyle Desk News18.com Last Updated: June 03, 2024, 13:01 IST New Delhi, India Ready-to-eat breakfast cereals made with whole grains are a part of this group. The fast-paced demands of life can impinge on the most regular tasks of our daily lives and make it seem daunting, especially in making sure that our children start their day with a nutritious breakfast. Preparing breakfast for our children during the morning rush, as they get ready for school, is an inevitable part of modern life. We cannot overlook or skip this important meal as we all know it is the fuel that sets the tone for the entire day, especially for our active little ones who are constantly on the move. Nadiya Merchant, Associate Director of Nutrition, Kellanova India, says, “The nutritional benefits of breakfast for children are well known, it not only keeps them energised but impacts cognitive functions such as attention span and memory. It also refuels the body, replenishes glucose levels, improves nutrient intake, and promotes overall metabolic health.” It is therefore necessary to help your child develop a healthy relationship with their morning meal. Skipping the first meal of the day should never be an option. Merchant adds, “Breakfast should provide a variety of nutrients such as carbohydrates, fibre, protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals that perform wide range of functions in the body. These nutrients must be obtained through a judicious combination of different food groups such as grains, especially whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and dairy.” So, how do you ensure that your breakfast provides whole-grain food and fibre? The whole grain food group, which is quite vast, includes wheat, rice, corn, oats, barley and ragi, among others. Whole grains provide carbohydrates especially fibre, B vitamins and antioxidants which are important for health. Fibre, found in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes, is important for digestive well-being and helps release energy gradually by slowing down the digestion of carbohydrates. Merchant shares, “Ready-to-eat breakfast cereals made with whole grains are a part of this group. A bowl of breakfast cereal is often best enjoyed with milk or yoghurt and fruits or dry fruits. It provides a mix of nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and fibre. What also makes it so popular among parents and kids today is the fact that it fits perfectly into the rush-hour lifestyle, can be prepared quickly and is both nourishing and tasty.” There will be days when you choose to go beyond ready-to-eat breakfast cereals and create a memorable breakfast experience for your kids by using your imagination. With creativity, you incorporate whole grains and fibre through a playful morning platter full of vibrant shapes, colours, and diverse range of textures to keep them enthusiastic about their morning meal. For instance, a plate of multigrain pancakes or waffles, topped with berries, yoghurt and nuts or whole grain bread sandwiches loaded with fresh veggies like cucumber, tomato, shredded carrots, lettuce leaves and a glass of milk/buttermilk will ensure that your child gets his/her share of whole grains, fibre, protein, vitamins, and minerals at the very start of the day. Remember, these habits will go a long way in instilling a healthy relationship with food in your child and setting a foundation for a lifetime of healthy eating."

    "article_content": "Published By : Shreeja Bhattacharya Trending Desk Last Updated: June 07, 2024, 07:10 IST New Delhi, India The saturated fats in biscuits contribute to high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels. (Image: Shutterstock) Whether you are craving a quick bite, looking to tide over your hunger or wanting to enjoy your tea, biscuits are the ultimate snack. Easy to pack or stash in a desk drawer, they’re perfect for a quick, on-the-go snack. But have you ever wondered if biscuits are a healthy choice? Bursting the bubble about one of the most-consumed snacks, Nutritionist Amita Gadre explained, “Biscuits fall short of being a wholesome choice due to their lacking nutritional profile. Characterised by a high fat and refined flour content and no fibre content. Any cookie or biscuit offers just empty calories. Meaning other than energy or calories, you don’t get any nutrients like protein, vitamins, or minerals.” “You might find sugar-free, zero-fat, no Maida, or diabetes-friendly biscuits. Even then, they are mostly empty calories. If we continue to eat food that doesn’t provide us with adequate nutrition, we will miss out on opportunities to nourish our bodies. Also, biscuits are made up of mostly refined wheat flour, or maida, and they lack fibre. Poor fibre intake is the primary cause of constipation in children as well as adults,” she added. She further shared that she has seen adults eating cold-pressed oil to lower cholesterol but not reducing their intake of biscuits. The saturated fats in biscuits contribute to high triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels. A post shared by Amita Gadre | Nutritionist (@amitagadre) She went on to say, “Remember, when I say biscuits, I am also talking about rusk, khari, nankatai, and jeera biscuits. They are all the same.” Shocking, right? But the question that echoed through the minds of many was, “If not biscuits, then what to eat with tea?” The nutritionist advised, “Nothing,” but added that if you feel hungry, opt for wholesome, nourishing foods like makhana, low-oil chewda, methi thepla, vegetable rolls or fruit. She also cautioned to maintain a gap of at least 15 minutes between tea and food to prevent the anti-nutrients in tea from affecting the iron content of your meal. Does this mean you can’t ever eat biscuits? Nutritionist Amita Gadre reassures that you can occasionally indulge in a cream biscuit of your choice. However, she advises against making it a habit."

    "article_content": "Published By : Shreeja Bhattacharya Trending Desk Last Updated: June 07, 2024, 08:15 IST New Delhi, India ICMR pointed out that boiling cereals and legumes decreases the concentration of phytic acid, which hinders the absorption of minerals. (Image: Shutterstock) The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) last month released dietary guidelines to encourage healthy eating habits among citizens. Through the 17 guidelines, the apex medical research body stressed that overcooking or boiling the pulses for too long reduces the quality of essential proteins present in them. Reasoning the same, ICMR noted that cooking pulses for a longer time leads to “loss of lysine.” Not only this but ICMR also revealed that the best way to improve the nutritional value of a meal is to prepare it in a pressure cooker or simply boil it. ICMR said, “Pulses should not be overcooked or boiled for too long as this reduces the quality of proteins. Longer cooking causes a drop in the nutritive value of pulses as it results in the loss of lysine.” While reasoning why one must prepare pulses in the pressure cooker, ICMR stated that the cooking method destroys anti-nutritional factors like enzymes. It is worth noting that enzymes don’t allow essential nutrients to get digested. The guidelines highlighted, “Boiling or pressure cooking is the best way to improve the nutritional quality of pulses since anti-nutritional factors (enzyme inhibitors that do not allow nutrients to get digested) are destroyed during boiling and pressure cooking. Hence, these methods increase the digestibility and therefore protein availability.” Explaining further, ICMR pointed out that boiling cereals and legumes decreases the concentration of phytic acid, which hinders the absorption of minerals. Therefore, it makes crucial minerals like calcium, magnesium, iron and zinc absorbable at the time the digestion process takes place. It advised adding enough water when boiling pulses to improve the nutritional quality of pulses. “Remember to add only the required amount of water during boiling. B complex vitamins and vitamin C may be lost if the cooking water after boiling is discarded. Prolonged boiling also results in the loss of vitamins. Mineral content is not dramatically altered with boiling,” ICMR added. ICMR also recommended steaming the green vegetables to increase the level of antioxidants and polyphenols in them. The guidelines read, “In contrast to boiling, during the process of steaming, the food merely comes into contact with steam. Direct contact between vegetable tissue and water is thus avoided, which significantly minimizes the loss of water-soluble vitamins and phytochemical compounds through leaching.” ICMR in collaboration with the National Institute of Nutrition has released 17 new dietary guidelines tailored to Indians of various age groups. The guidelines emphasised the importance of a balanced diet, encouraging the consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains and lean meats while advising moderation in intake of oil, sugar and salt."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Lifestyle Desk News18.com Last Updated: June 09, 2024, 13:32 IST New Delhi, India Cast iron continues to stand the test of time as a valuable companion in the kitchen In an era dominated by sleek stainless steel and non-stick cookware, cast iron stands as a stalwart symbol of tradition and durability in the kitchen. Its timeless appeal lies in its ability to withstand the test of time, offering generations of cooks unparalleled performance and versatility. From searing steaks to baking artisanal bread, cast iron excels in delivering even heat distribution and unparalleled flavor enhancement. Beyond its culinary prowess, cast iron evokes a sense of nostalgia and connection to the past, reminding us of simpler times when meals were cooked with care and shared with loved ones. As we rediscover the joys of traditional cooking methods, the enduring allure of cast iron continues to captivate home chefs and culinary enthusiasts alike, reaffirming its status as an indispensable tool in the modern kitchen. For Dr Manu Nanda, Chief Marketing Officer, Stove Kraft Ltd, there’s something incredibly grounding and comforting about rediscovering the timeless traditions of our ancestors. “Cast iron cookware is a prime example of this – a humble material that has stood the test of time, transcending generations with its durability, versatility, and unparalleled ability to imbue foods with rich, unmatched flavors.” This remarkable material is virtually indestructible, able to withstand the highest heat without warping or cracking. “Its natural non-stick properties develop over time, eliminating the need for harmful chemical coatings. And let’s not forget the incredible flavor it imparts to foods – that iconic, wholesome, deeply satisfying taste that can only come from cast iron’s ability to evenly distribute and retain heat,” shares Dr Nanda. Perhaps most importantly, cast iron cookware is also a natural source of dietary iron, an essential mineral that many of us struggle to get enough of in our modern diets. As the iron from the cookware subtly transfers into our foods during cooking, we benefit from a delicious and nutritious boost with every meal. It is also a treasured family heirloom, passed down from one generation to the next with love, memories, and flavors absorbed over decades of use."

Add 40g of unsalted butter and stir until melted. Gradually add fresh cream, stirring constantly until smooth. Set aside to cool slightly. • Crush Monaco biscuits into fine crumbs and mix with 20g of melted unsalted butter. Press this mixture into a 6-inch tart mould and bake at 160°C for 10 minutes until lightly golden and firm. • In a bowl, combine roasted almond flakes with the toffee sauce until evenly coated. • Pour the almond and toffee mixture over the baked biscuit crumble in the tart mould, spreading evenly. • Bake the tart in the preheated oven at 180°C for 15 minutes until the filling is set and the edges are golden brown. • Allow the tart to cool slightly before carefully removing it from the mould. • Serve the Almond Cinnamon Tart warm, with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream for a delightful treat.

    "article_content": "Published By : Shreeja Bhattacharya Trending Desk Last Updated: June 15, 2024, 07:00 IST New Delhi, India ICMR is not the only organisation that has warned Indians against excessive sodium intake. (Image: Shutterstock) The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has once again warned against excessive salt consumption in its recent guidelines. The research council revealed that since all types of salts have the same sodium content, it does not matter if one takes extra pink salt or consumes standard table salt. This clarification counters the common belief that some types of salts are okay to consume in extra quantities as they are healthier. Rock salts like pink salt (sendha namak) and black salt (kala namak) are believed to be healthier as they have added minerals like iron, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and manganese. In its guidelines, ICMR said, “Pink and black salts can be easily distinguished by their colour, texture and smell. Pink salt is one of the purest forms of salt. Black salt upon storage grows darker. Assorted spices, charcoal, seeds and tree bark are used in the preservation of this salt. Therefore, irrespective of the variety of salt, their consumption should be limited as the sodium content in them is almost similar.” ICMR is not the only organisation that has warned Indians against excessive sodium intake. Back in 2023, the WHO Global Report on Sodium Intake Reduction listed India amongst the top 50 countries with extra salt consumption. Ideally, one is expected to take a maximum of 5 grams of salt daily. The WHO study reveals that in India the average salt consumption often exceeds 10 grams per day, which is double the recommended number. The high salt intake is linked with several health complications such as hypertension, high risk of heart diseases, and poor gut health. Its new guidelines, ICMR notes, “Existing evidence reveals a deleterious impact of high salt intake on blood vessels, blood pressure, bones and gastrointestinal tract. There is a strong association between salt intake and blood pressure.” In extreme cases, excessive salt intake has also been associated with gastric cancer. Additionally, higher sodium intake can negatively affect our bone health by reducing its density by promoting calcium excretion. ICMR suggests that in addition to monitoring one’s salt intake, one should include potassium-rich foods such as fresh vegetables in their meals as these food groups help in the excretion of extra sodium. One can also prefer to use special low-sodium salt substitutes (LSSS) or reduced sodium salt. These salts are made by replacing sodium chloride with potassium chloride or magnesium sulfate."

(X) WWE Universal Champion Cody Rhodes has developed a huge fanbase with his never-give-up mentality. The support was evident when the company decided to replace Rhodes with Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson in the WrestleMania roster earlier in April. After fans showed their displeasure, WWE was forced to book the American Nightmare for a title match against Roman Reigns. Rhodes first started hitting headlines when he beat Seth Rollins consecutively at WrestleMania 38 and WWE Backlash. The duo once again met inside the steel structure at Hell in a Cell and this time again, Rhodes had the last laugh Rhodes, who competed with an injury, recently reminisced about the match on a social media post. The steel cage fight might have been cancelled after Rhodes tore his pec during a training season. WWE, however, wanted the fight to take place, considering the hype among fans. Despite struggling with the injury, Rhodes put up a neck-and-neck battle against Rollins. After winning the match, Rhodes underwent surgery and had to take a break from WWE to recover. Glimpses of the battle recently surfaced on X (formerly Twitter) with the caption, “2 years ago today, Cody Rhodes wrestled Seth Rollins with a torn pec. Absolutely Wild.” I didn’t win this match, Chicago won it for meI was so embarrassed and dejected, nothing in the eyes and just enough left in the tank for one dance Just the clips are wild enough for me https://t.co/ErcTaTSUno — Cody Rhodes (@CodyRhodes) June 5, 2024 The American Nightmare reposted the footage and shared that he felt “embarrassed and dejected” while going into the Hell in a Cell event. “I didn’t win this match, Chicago won it for me. I was so embarrassed and dejected, with nothing in my eyes and just enough left in the tank for one dance. Just the clips are wild enough for me,” Rhodes wrote on X. As far as his next big assignment is concerned, Cody Rhodes is expected to defend his Universal Championship title at the WWE Clash at the Castle, scheduled for June 15. He will go up against AJ Styles, who has kept his eyes on the coveted title for a long time. The duo earlier clashed at WWE Backlash where Rhodes secured a comfortable win to retain the title. On the last episode of Friday Night SmackDown, AJ Styles launched a surprise attack on Rhodes after teasing his retirement. Styles were supported by Karl Anderson and Luke Gallows who are also desperate to dethrone Rhodes. While Rhodes is set to take revenge at Clash at the Castle, WWE has yet to confirm if his Universal Championship will be on the line."

    "article_content": "Published By : Vivek Ganapathy Trending Desk Last Updated: June 07, 2024, 18:46 IST United States of America (USA) Roman Reigns. (X) WWE star Roman Reigns’ absence from the company’s promotional material has led to several doubts over his future. Reigns has not made a WWE appearance since losing his Universal Championship to Cody Rhodes. Speculations of a potential return were quite high as the company gears up for one of its biggest events of the summer, WWE SummerSlam. The rumours sparked after the Tribal Chief was spotted training with a close friend. But the company has seemingly revised its plans for Reigns’ return. A promotion for the final SmackDown night before SummerSlam was recently released and Reigns was notably absent from the star-studded line-up. Presale for WWE: Friday Night SmackDown is LIVE! Use code FRIDAY for early access to tickets through tomorrow.: https://t.co/JkxIVo1Qt0 pic.twitter.com/1vMYIbTBi5 — Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse (@RMFieldHouse) June 5, 2024 Instead of Reigns, the advertisement featured several other stars like Cody Rhodes, Randy Orton, LA Knight, Bayley, Jade Cargill and Bianca Belair. This suggests that Reigns’ hiatus will likely extend beyond SummerSlam. It, however, should be noted that the Tribal Chief’s omission from the promotional material does not mean that he will not return to the company. His recent intense training session with bodybuilder and actor Kai Greene only suggests that Reigns is preparing for a blockbuster return with the company. Reigns’ absence from the company was speculated way before WrestleMania 40. Former WWE head writer Vince Russo had talked about how the multiple-time heavyweight champion could be leaving the company for a brief time. He explained that if the company shifted their focus to Rhodes and The Rock it would give Reigns a window to take a break. He said, “That does give Roman the time off. If they go to Cody and Rock, that can give Roman the time off”. Reigns is one of the biggest stars that WWE has produced in the last decade. While the former Universal Champion has consistently performed in multiple main events, Reigns has operated on a limited schedule. He held the Undisputed Championship for a record 1,316 days before losing the title to Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania and has not appeared since. During his absence, Reigns is also working on a heist comedy film named ‘Good Fortune’. The movie is set to be released in late 2024. It features a star-studded cast including actors like Keanu Reeves, Keke Palmer and Sandra Oh."

Jordan then ascended to the top of the ladder to grab the inaugural championship, sealing a monumental win.

With a last jolt of energy, the supersonic duo turned a Spanish Fly into a Phoenix Splash. The match-up was so intense that a ‘This is Awesome’ chant broke out around the arena. It seemed like the Good Brothers’ best chance to secure a victory but failing to do so, they will now have to wait for another title shot. Roxanne Perez beats Jordynne Grace at NXT Battleground The TNA Knockouts Champion Jordynne Grace made a solid championship match debut, dominating the major portion of the fight using her strength.

(Pic Credit: WWE) WWE Universal Champion Cody Rhodes elated fans by suggesting that he wanted to visit some old friends at NXT. Rhodes is currently one of the prominent names in the WWE. The champ, however, donned the role of a fan for a day as he tuned in to watch WWE NXT Battleground. The premium live event of the company’s developmental brand was held in Nevada yesterday, June 9. Rhodes shared a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to reveal that he was watching the pay-per-view while also suggesting that he was thinking of visiting his old buddies in Florida. Tagging NXT in charge Shawn Michaels and commentator Vic Joseph, he wrote, “Actually thinking of “dashing” down to FL this week with a gift and see some old friends.” Watching @WWENXT Battleground curious how my old friend @OfficialEGO will do against @_trickwilliams ( Actually thinking of “dashing” down to FL this week with a gift and see some old friends ) @VicJosephWWE @ShawnMichaels — Cody Rhodes (@CodyRhodes) June 10, 2024 The interesting revelation from Rhodes sparked several reactions from WWE fans who just could not believe that the Universal Champion could make an NXT appearance soon. One of them enquired, “Cody going down to NXT again?” Cody going down to NXT again? pic.twitter.com/HadbnjG5g6 — Cory (@Cory_Hays407) June 10, 2024 Another asked, “Cody to NXT again?!?!” CODY TO NXT AGAIN?!? pic.twitter.com/ABnqdxdAhO — #WeWantCody (@WeWantCody_) June 10, 2024 One fan suggested that it would be great to see the Universal Champion visit the company’s developmental brand once again. “Yes! A Cody appearance on NXT this week would be so awesome”. Yes! A Cody appearance on NXT this week would be so awesome— Tim Lenhart (@Genwrestlegames) June 10, 2024 “Yes, stop by NXT before heading to Scotland!” wrote another. Yes, stop by NXT before heading to Scotland!— Alexa (@ahhhhhrexa) June 10, 2024 “Been a blast watching Battleground tonight! Would also love to see you visit NXT again, would be really special I’m sure, “ added one more. Been a blast watching Battleground tonight! ♥️ Would also love to see you visit NXT again, would be really special I’m sure!— Elizabeth Rose (@mamakuik) June 10, 2024 In his post, Rhodes also disclosed how he was excited about NXT Battlerground’s main event between Ethan Page and Trick Williams. The Universal Champion revealed that he and Page were old buddies. Rhodes added that he was curious to see how his old friend performed in the NXT Championship match at the UFC Apex Arena in Las Vegas. He wrote, “Watching WWE NXT Battleground, curious how my old friend Ethan Page will do against Trick Williams.” It seems like fortune was not on the side of Rhodes’ old buddy as Page lost his NXT Championship match to Trick Williams. Despite being the obvious leader in action, Page was unable to secure the NXT Championship at Battleground. The challenger attempted to put away Williams using his best shot but failed to do so. This frustrated Page who got incensed by the referee. The distraction enabled the champion to recover before finishing off Page with the Trick Knee. As for Rhodes’ NXT appearance, nothing has been confirmed by the WWE. It remains to be seen if the Universal Champion will return to Florida next week."

    "article_content": "Published By : Vivek Ganapathy Trending Desk Last Updated: June 17, 2024, 16:29 IST United States of America (USA) Shawn Michaels. (X) WWE legend Shawn Michaels has reminisced about one of the underrated matches of his wrestling career. Fans mostly remember Michaels for his storied rivalries against The Undertaker, Bret Hart and his fellow DX member Paul Levesque aka Triple H. During his heyday, Michaels competed against some other superstars of his time but those feuds were not popular enough. He talked about one such match during a recent interaction with The Schmo. The Heartbreak Kid once went up against Mick Foley in a title clash at WWF Mind Games in 1996. Michaels secured an easy win in the match and clinched the World Heavyweight Championship. Speaking about the fight with The Schmo, the two-time WWE Hall of Famer said, “I don’t know if they were fused with the two matches that I’m pretty proud of, but one of my most underrated feuds was the one with Mankind. Mick and I had a hell of a match at WWF Mind Games, but it was just a one-shot deal. And it’s one of those things that I always feel like had Mick and I had a better opportunity to have a much bigger storyline, we could have really done some fantastic things,” as quoted by Wrestling INC. During the conversation, Michaels referred to another match that he reckons failed to create much hype. At the 1995 In Your House 2: The Lumberjacks event, he clashed against Jeff Jarrett in an Intercontinental Championship match. Michaels had the last laugh in the fight and won the coveted title for the third time in his career. He later defended the Intercontinental Championship against Razor Ramon at the 1995 SummerSlam. Recalling the match against Jarret, Michaels said, “Jeff and I always had really good chemistry. I think the matches against Foley and Jarrett get mentioned a lot, but they don’t get brought up in the overall big story standpoint of my career.” Shawn Michaels, who won the WWE Championship multiple times, earned the moniker “Mr WrestleMania” for putting up some impressive performances at the premium live event. He competed in 17 WrestleMania matches and won six of them. Michaels got the better of some top-tier wrestlers like El Matador, Chris Jericho, Vince McMahon and Ric Flair at the pay-per-view event."

(X) Former WWE Women’s Champion Becky Lynch had some emotional words for her husband and co-worker Seth Rollins on Father’s Day. Lynch has not returned to the company since her contract expired earlier this month. Her husband, Rollins is also absent from WWE action due to a knee injury. Amid the duo’s time off live television, the WWE diva had a special message for Rollins. Sharing a few photographs of the former World Heavyweight Champion and their daughter Roux Lopez on Instagram and wrote, “We are the luckiest. We love you. Happy Father’s Day Seth Rollins”. A post shared by Rebecca Quin (@beckylynchwwe) In the first photograph, Seth Rollins can be seen lifting his daughter on his shoulder as they both smile. The second picture was a selfie where Rollins and Roux were seated on an amusement park ride. In another photograph, the former World Heavyweight Champion could be seen signing some posters with his daughter seated beside him. The heartwarming set of images has now drawn the attention of several wrestling fans on the internet. One of them replied to the post, “Aww Becky that’s a beautiful family you got there. It’s your greatest accomplishment besides being The Man. We all love you big time Becks.” Another suggested that he was missing the wrestling duo on TV. “Missing you guys on my tv. Happy Father’s Day, Seth.” he said. One more added, “This is so cute! Love you guys”. Another wrote, “So cute! Happy Father’s Day Seth Rollins. We miss you guys!!” “The cutest. Happy Father’s Day,” wrote one more. For the unversed, Lynch and Rollins tied the knot back in June 2021. The wrestling couple welcomed their first and only child Roux Lopez months before their marriage, in December 2020. They have been together ever since, performing regularly in WWE. Just a few months ago, it was rumoured that Lynch could be making her way out of WWE. She hasn’t re-signed with the company since her contract expired on June 1. Considering the Irish wrestling star was finally a free agent after a decade, it was rumoured that Lynch received offers from other wrestling promotions. One such instance happened a few weeks ago after ex-WWE superstar and GCW Manager Matt Cardona invited ‘The Man’ to attend his company’s live event. He shared a post on X and said, “As GCW General manager, I am personally inviting the diva to GC Wrestling Cage of Survival this Sunday.” As GCW General Manager, I am personally inviting @BeckyLynchWWE to @GCWrestling_ Cage of Survival this Sunday! https://t.co/8Kwusu5sR2 pic.twitter.com/jG5L36R0Zu — Matt Cardona (@TheMattCardona) June 1, 2024 Lynch still hasn’t spoken about her future with the WWE.

(X) WWE interviewer Cathy Kelley took a slight dig at Dominik Mysterio on Father’s Day in a social media post. For the unversed, Dominik and his father Rey Mysterio currently have an ongoing feud in the WWE. Easily amongst one of the more prominent father-son rivalries, the feud began two years ago in 2022. Since then, Dirty Dom has disrespected his father on several occasions. Taking a dig at Dominik’s behaviour Cathy shared a post on X saying that she wished Rey a happy Father’s Day because she was certain that Dominik hadn’t. “Just saw Rey and told him happy Father’s Day so at least someone does,” she wrote. just saw Rey and told him happy father’s day so at least someone does— Cathy Kelley (@catherinekelley) June 17, 2024 As for the Mysterio feud, it has been quite evident that Dirty Dom does not like his dad. He has himself clear in multiple interviews in the past. This father-son feud began at WWE Clash At The Castle in 2022 when Dominik betrayed his dad. At the premium live event, Dominik attacked Rey to leave the entire WWE Universe in disbelief. The young wrestler chose to align himself with the Judgment Day alongside stars like Rhea Ripley, Finn Balor and Damian Priest. He even walked out on his father’s WWE Hall of Fame induction speech last year, ultimately leading to a father-son clash at WrestleMania 39. Days ahead of the clash, Dominik Mysterio gave an interview to Alex McCarthy. He took a massive shot at his dad and said, “He’s done. Like Damian [Priest] said, he’s washed and I just really don’t think that he wants to be in there with me, not only because I don’t think he has the balls to, but he understands that he can’t hang in there with me.” Dominik further spoke about Rey was not interested in a match with Dominik and said, “At the end of the day, it’s on him. I’ve proven my point, I’ve been in there, provoked him multiple times, but he’s not taking the bait, so I can’t see it happening, but if it does it’s going to be on him.” Rey had enough of Dominik Mysterio’s hateful comments as he accepted his challenge for a match at WrestleMania. Rey had the last laugh as he beat his son at the Show of Shows in 2023. Speaking of Father’s Day, Dominik Mysterio also received a strange wish on the auspicious occasion. While several superstars penned down emotional words for their fathers, Liv Morgan took a different approach. She posted a picture of herself and Dominik on X and wrote, “Happy Father’s Day, Daddy”. The unsettling post left several WWE fans scratching their head. Happy Father’s Day Daddy @DomMysterio35 pic.twitter.com/7yPI4vgeJS — LIV Morgan (@YaOnlyLivvOnce) June 16, 2024 The current Women’s World Champion is yet to explain the reason behind the bizarre Father’s Day wish."

He then added that he wouldn’t be able to do that without getting back the championship he made. His words led to the current World Heavyweight Champion Damian Priest making his way to the ring. Priest then told Rollins that the ex-champion could have his title shot at Money In The Bank. Drew McIntyre quits WWE On the night’s second promo, Scottish wrestling star Drew McIntyre attempted to address the Texas crowd. However, the fans kept chanting CM Punk’s name to prevent McIntyre from speaking. The Scotsman grew visibly frustrated and said he couldn’t do it anymore. He dropped the microphone after saying that he quit. McIntyre then started walking away from the stage. Adam Pearce met him backstage to talk some sense into the star. However, McIntyre just wasn’t willing to listen and said he was done. Triple H also tried to talk to the WWE superstar but he wasn’t interested. Jey Uso qualifies for the WWE Money In The Bank 2024 ladder Match Jey Uso, Rey Mysterio and Finn Balor squared off on Raw’s main event for a spot at the WWE Men’s Money In The Bank Briefcase ladder match. The action quickly spilt out of the ring as the match was underway. Soon Mysterio was attacked by Dominik and McDonagh who took him out of the match. Balor took advantage and landed a double stomp off the top. Next, Balor pinned Mysterio but Jey broke it up. He then landed a Uso Splash to seal a pinfall victory. As Jey celebrated, the lights went out and Uncle Howdy appeared out of nowhere. Howdy then blew off his lantern as the show went off air.

The company’s Performance Centre in Florida was the official venue for the weekly live event. The latest NXT episode was jam-packed with some entertaining wrestling action. The show began with a 25-man over-the-top-rope battle royal to decide the number one contender for Trick Williams’ NXT Men’s title. A championship match was also on the cards as Kelani Jordan defended the NXT Women’s North American Championship. The main event saw Ethan Page square off against Je’Von Evans with Williams at ringside. Fans hear from Oba Femi Oba Femi addressed the WWE Universe saying it was quite familiar for him to stand in the ring having retained his North American Championship again. He then added nobody could take away the title from him since he already defeated the best superstars NXT had to offer. This led to West Lee making his way down the ramp and reminding Femi that he was never pinned at Battleground. Irritated by Lee’s claims, Femi gave the challenger another title shot but with a stipulation. Femi said that after this championship match, Lee would no longer be able to challenge for the title. Kelani Jordan retains the NXT Women’s North American Championship The match began with some side headlocks and shoulder blocks. After some high-octane action, Michin tried to lock in the Electric Chair on Jordan. However, the champion countered the move into a reverse Hurricanrana.

As the challenger climbed up to the top rope Jaida Parker appeared out of nowhere to push Michin off the rope, allowing Jordan to land a split-legged moonsault for a victory.

Soon, Evans went flying off the top rope to level Page and Spears with a double cutter. The four main remain laid out in the ring as the show went off air. 25-Man Battle Royal to decide the Number One Contender for the NXT Championship – Je’Von Evans eliminated Shawn Spears to become the number one contender for the NXT Championship.

WWE superstar Randy Orton had just one word to share after Tommaso Ciampa tried a sneak attack on him. Ciampa is currently signed to the WWE SmackDown roster as part of the DIY tag team along with Johnny Gargano. Days ahead of the weekly live event, Gargano shared a video of Ciama attempting Orton’s RKO on X (formerly Twitter) while the Viper was on a phone call. Seeing the multi-time world champion distracted, the 39-year-old wrestling star attempted the famous WWE finisher on Orton but failed miserably. Later, Orton reshared Gargano’s post while writing, “Bruh”. Bruh https://t.co/crdM8WsAGk — Randy Orton (@RandyOrton) June 20, 2024 The hilarious segment begins with Ciampa revealing the one thing that was getting on his nerves. Upon being questioned by Gargano, Ciampa revealed that it was Orton’s return to the company that bothered him. “Ever since his return, with his stupid music and his stupid muscles…,” he is heard saying. Ciampa’s teammate seemed to disagree and said, “It’s awesome, his music’s awesome, his muscles are awesome, he looks great, he looks cool…” Before Garagano could finish his words, Ciampa interrupted and said, “I am gonna put an end to it, I am gonna RKO Randy right now. Look at this, you got to be quiet, he’s never gonna see this, are you ready?” Ciampa then positioned himself for the finisher but Orton moved out of the way, leading to Gargano’s teammate falling flat on the ground. The fall resulted in a loud thud as Ciampa got up in pain. Gargano then says, “Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!” WWE fans just could not help but react to the hilarious event. One said, “Lmao. That walk away was way too smooth!” LmaooooooooooooooooooThat walk away was wayyyyy too smooth ☠️ — HTX Phantom (@HTXPhantom12) June 19, 2024 Another social media user commented, “The floor bump kills me, out of nowhere, you are goat Ciampa, absolutely goat.” the floor bump kills me out of nowhere you are goat ciampa absolutely goat— Heath wilson I ™️ (@Heathwilson2) June 19, 2024 One highlighted that Ciampa should not have shouted before going for the finisher. “He shouldn’t have had yelled Out Of Nowhere.

(Credit: X) Kevin Owens did not feature in a battle at the Clash at the Castle but the WWE star still managed to leave an impact on the show. Following Cody Rhodes’ fight at the Clash at the Castle, Owens made his appearance. Owens and Randy Orton came out to save Cody from The Bloodline’s assault. While speaking about the Clash at the Castle match cards, Owens particularly talked about Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark. The Canadian professional wrestler even went on to admit that he feels “glad” about the fact that he will never have to face Shayna and Stark inside the ring. “They are both pretty terrifying. I’m glad I don’t ever have to get in the ring with them,” Owens said to the Kickoff show panel ahead of WWE Clash at the Castle. Stark and Baszler were involved in a title decider at the WWE Clash At The Castle 2024. Stark and Shayna took part in a triple threat fight for the Women’s Tag Team Championship. Bianca Belair and Jade Cargill defended their title against the teams of Stark and Shayna and Alba Fyre and Isla Dawn. Stark and Baszler ended up on the losing side and Fyre and Dawn emerged as the new Women’s Tag Team Champions. Dawn hit Cargill with a German suplex and pinned Baszler to clinch the Women’s Tag Team Championship title. Meanwhile, Orton recently made his return to WWE SmackDown and helped Owens in tackling The Bloodline. Following the show, Orton and Owens talked about their chemistry and bonding in a WWE digital exclusive video. Recalling Orton’s move, Owens stated, as per 411 Mania, “It was a moral victory. Are we friends? Would you say that’s an accurate statement?” Responding to Owens, Orton said, “I think we’re getting there. We got a little ways to go.” “Listen, out of nowhere is kind of my thing, so I figured tonight, we’re in Scotland, I love Scotland. Hell, Drew’s from Scotland, I love Drew, what can I say? I just figured I’d come all the way over here across the sea, and I would help my friend, acquaintance, buddy, whatever you want to call it,” Orton added. The Bloodline’s Solo Sikoa recently got the better of Owens in a main event of WWE SmackDown. Owens was primed to win the clash but Paul Heyman’s intervention played a key role in guiding Sikoa to a victory. Stay updated with the latest from Euro 2024 . Explore Euro 2024 Match Today.

(Instagram) WWE superstar Charlotte Flair has finally shared an update on her recovery from a knee injury that she suffered last year. One of the greatest female wrestlers in the company’s history, Charlotte has been a prominent figure in the women’s division in recent times.

In the post, she wrote, “Today, was my first bio dex (isokinetic training) test!” A post shared by Charlotte Flair (@charlottewwe) Charlotte Flair shared a video of herself where she can be seen doing some exercises at the gym. Charlotte could be seen shutting her eyes in pain as she trained. Speaking about her recovery, she further said, “I needed to be in the 40 per cent or less deficit for strength compared to my non-surgical leg. I had 20 per cent or less quad strength and in some of the measurements, I was stronger in my surgical leg.” Charlotte also talked about how much she missed her fans and wanted to get back to wrestling as soon as she was fit. “I miss you guys and can’t wait to lace my boots again!” she concluded.

It was later reported by PWInsider.com that Charlotte’s injury led to the star returning to her home in Florida. The last couple of years have not been memorable for Charlotte Flair. Her knee injury last year was the third time the wrestling star left the company on a break due to fitness issues. She missed over seven months of action in 2022 followed by another two-month hiatus towards the year’s end.

    "article_content": "Reported By : Vivek Ganapathy News18.com Last Updated: June 07, 2024, 21:02 IST New Delhi, India Kush Maini. (X) Indian F2 driver Kush Maini recently got behind the wheel of the BWT Alpine F1 car as the 23-year-old tested the powerful automobile in his role as a development driver for the Formula One side. It was the racer’s first full Formula 1 test and the racer from Bengaluru was over the moon following the privilege. He did have a test run back in the year 2021, but it was just a single lap, with the recent test giving the driver comprehensively more time at the helm of the mean machine. He shared his experience of commandeering the powerful Formula One vehicle, terming the automobile as the pinnacle of the sport. “It still hasn’t sunk in,” he began as he tried to describe the adrenaline-pumping experience. “You think it is going to be a step up, but it is so much more than you can imagine,” he explained. “It has so much more downforce. These cars are at the pinnacle of what we do in our sport and are at the limit of the rules,” he elaborated. He drew a comparison between the experience of the car on the F2 circuit and emphasised the massive jump between the power and performance levels. “They are so quick through the fast corners. For instance, at the Red Bull Ring, we were going five, six-second quicker than what we did at F2,” Maini said. “So it is a complete step up. The G – Force you feel is something else. My neck still hurts,” he jested. “It is something you can’t really prepare for. It was just unreal,” he reflected. “The first session was sort of getting into it, but as soon as the first session got over, it was going for lap time and trying to be as quick as I can,” the 23-year-old elaborated. He went on to give a low-down on the technicalities of the car and expressed his delight on having had a first-hand experience of the machine. “Obviously in F1 you can tweak the balance and you can adjust the diff, which is basically how much lock you want to apply on the diff, or unlock it. Understeer, oversteer and all that. So it is leaps and bounds ahead of the F2 car in terms of all the procedures and stuff, but it is such an unreal experience and I’m just lucky to have been able to do it,” Maini clarified. He also spoke about the future of the sport in India in a passionate and rational tone as the youngster cut a confident yet humble figure while discussing the same. “For me, a dream of mine has always been to put India properly on the motorsport map,” he asserted. “I think there are a lot of kids who want to do this sport, but have no idea how to do it,” he added. He went on to add that it would be provident to speak of bringing about changes once he has stamped his authority by proving himself on the track with a promotion to the highest level of the sport. “I think step one for me is to make it myself. I think achieving the dream of reaching Formula One will open doors and help me proceed and improve this culture in our country. That is definitely a big goal of mine,” he reiterated. “But, like you know, you got to make it first before going on to change things!” “And as I said, my only goal is to do as well as I can in Formula 2 to make it to the pinnacle,” the F2 driver signed off."

    "article_content": "Curated By : Ritayan Basu AFP Last Updated: June 08, 2024, 10:11 IST Montreal F1: Fernando Alonso at the Canadian Grand Prix (AP) Fernando Alonso led the way for Aston Martin in Friday’s second free practice at the Canadian Grand Prix, the two-time world champion making the most of changing conditions to outpace Mercedes’ George Russell on a wet day at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. Alonso clocked a best lap in one minute and 15.810 seconds to beat Russell by 0.462 seconds in an unpredictable and open session that saw Red Bull’s defending three-time world champion Max Verstappen struggling again. The Dutchman managed only four laps and jumped out of his smoking car in the pits midway through a session that offered few clues of what to expect in Saturday’s qualifying or Sunday’s race. Home hope Lance Stroll was third in the second Aston Martin ahead of Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, winner of his home Monaco Grand Prix two weeks ago, Daniel Ricciardo of RB, Haas’s Kevin Magnussen and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton in the second Mercedes. Yuki Tsnuoda was eighth for RB ahead of improving Williams’ Alex Albon with Sergio Perez 10th for Red Bull, days after signing a two-year contract extension with the team. After a rain-hit opening session, which reduced the action to only 35 minutes including just five on slicks, there was an early queue to leave the pit lane as another rainstorm arrived. “It’s coming down much harder now,” warned Russell, as Verstappen led the way before pitting immediately to switch from softs to mediums. A bold lap on soft slicks from Alpine’s Pierre Gasly, in 1:29.007, lifted him 5.8 seconds clear of an earlier Hamilton lap. He trimmed it to 1:24.389 – a full 10 seconds faster than anyone else – and then to 1:20.789 before anyone else began to find any real grip. As they did, Ricciardo, Alonso and Stroll showed bold speed on softs, the home hero reducing the best lap time to 1:18.662 before Alonso clocked 1:17.835, the top three making light of the conditions. Verstappen’s recent struggles continued with the Red Bull driver pulling his car in and swiftly jumping out. “Can we get the fans?” he asked. “I think I smell a bit of smoke.” By mid-session, the track was declared dry again as Alonso trimmed the best lap to 1:15.810, four-tenths ahead of Russell, Stroll and Leclerc. Verstappen was gone, after only four completed laps as Red Bull organised a wall of mechanics to hide the repair work on an electronics problem from public view. Rain returned, with 24 minutes to go, sending the drivers back to the pits and most spectators deeper into their hooded waterproof ponchos. It meant frustration for Hamilton who, according to Mercedes, was on a pace-setting fastest lap before he was blocked at the final chicane by a Ferrari and had to take avoiding action. All this left the session’s meaningful running reduced again with Ocon heading out on intermediates followed by Alonso, Stroll and Norris. The Frenchman had missed the opening session, when Alpine handed his car to reserve rookie driver Jack Doohan."

The Briton took the prime starting spot because he set his lap time earlier in the session. In a dramatic conclusion to a closely-contested qualifying session, Mercedes’ Russell was unable to improve on his Q2 time while Red Bull’s series leader and three-time world champion shaved more than a second off his lap. It was enough to lift the Dutchman to the front row of the grid alongside the Briton, who secured his second career pole to give a boost to Mercedes as they emerge from a long period in the doldrums thanks to successive upgrades packages. “Amazing, amazing!” said a delighted Russell on Mercedes team radio. “Right, now we’ve got a race to win!” “I’ve missed this feeling,” he added. “So much hard work back at the factory has gone into this.” Verstappen, who was chasing a third successive Montreal pole, was philosophical. “It is what it is,” he said. “Going into qualifying, I would have taken that.” Lando Norris was third just 0.021 seconds off their pace ahead of McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri, RB’s Daniel Ricciardo, two-time champion Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton in the second Mercedes. “Congrats to Mr Russell,” said his friend Norris. “I am happy with third. A good job by us so I am happy and excited.” Yuki Tsunoda was eighth in the second RB ahead of Lance Stroll in the second Aston Martin and Williams Alex Albon with the two Ferraris failing to make the top ten shootout. Charles Leclerc, an emotional home winner of the Monaco Grand Prix two weeks earlier, qualified 11th and team-mate Carlos Sainz 12th. It was the first time since the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix that Ferrari had both cars eliminated without reaching Q3. With dark clouds threatening over the Ile Notre-Dame, Zhou Guanyu led his Alpine team-mate Valtteri Bottas out for Q1 in front of a big crowd. Verstappen set the early pace before Norris and Russell took command. A flurry of fastest laps in the final minutes left Perez facing early elimination just days after extending his Red Bull contract. Team-mate Verstappen topped the session in 1:12.360 ahead of RB’s Tsunoda, Hamilton and Albon while Valtteri Bottas of Sauber, Alpine’s Esteban Ocon, who has a five-place grid penalty for his crash in Monaco, Haas’s Nico Hulkenberg and Zhou Guanyu, in the second Sauber, went out. Russell was quickly on the pace to start Q2 as spectators reached for their hooded ponchos and light rain began falling. He went top until team-mate Hamilton took over and then Piastri. On their final flying runs, Norris went top and Tsunoda second while Verstappen, down in 14th, saved himself and secured a place in the top ten shootout – but both Ferraris failed to make it. Leclerc wound up 11th ahead of team-mate Sainz, both running on used tyres, and went out with Williams’ Logan Sargeant, Kevin Magnussen of Haas, and Alpine’s Pierre Gasly In a tense Q2 finale, Russell and Hamilton were first and second and the only two drivers in the 1:11s – Russell clocking 1:11.742 — ahead of Norris and the impressive Tsunoda. Verstappen was seventh. Piastri led the queue out of the pitlane ahead of Verstappen for Q3 while both Mercedes remained ‘at home’, sitting in their garage, until the sun emerged. Verstappen went top initially in 1:12.358, but both Mercedes men topped him on their first runs, Russell in 1:12.000 and Hamilton in 1:12.280, all of them running on used slicks. When their final runs began, Piastri and Norris both improved for McLaren to go second and third on new tyres before the final drama."

He has been beaten in two of the last three races and seen his aura of invincibility eroded. He said he was unfazed by being beaten by Russell even though they had identical lap times because the Briton clocked his time first. “No, I’m not worried by that,” Verstappen said. “And probably I should be pleasantly surprised to be on the front row in a way, but we lacked pace. “The time Mercedes did in FP3 – that is not possible for us. Not really. And we have had a messy weekend. We need to tidy up and we need to improve our car too. “There will be more rain tomorrow and then it will be all about how the tyres hold up in the race – and whoever is best at that wins. “So we have got a lot of work to do and it is not the easiest circuit for us here. But our target has to be that we are good everywhere.” His team-mate Sergio Perez, who signed an extended contract a week earlier, said qualifying had been a ‘disaster’ as he failed to progress beyond Q1 for the second successive race. “It was a total disaster as I just couldn’t get the grip,” Perez said. “The issue was mainly the rear end of the car, the rear axle. It felt a lot worse and I couldn’t get the tyres switched on.” Perez qualified 16th and faces a scrap on Sunday if he is to score any points for the team."

(AFP) Red Bull’s triple world champion Max Verstappen completed a Canadian Grand Prix hat-trick of victories on a wet, wild and tricky Sunday at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. Verstappen, who started on the front row alongside Mercedes pole sitter George Russell, stayed clear of trouble on a day of changing conditions, snatching the lead from McLaren’s Lando Norris on the final pit stops. The Dutchman then grimly hung on to claim his sixth victory from nine races this season and the 60th of his Formula One career. With this pole, Verstappen also clinched his 50th victory in his last 75 starts. It was another brilliant drive from the 26-year-old who dealt with constantly changing weather, pit stop battles and challenges from McLaren and Mercedes while wrestling with his Red Bull’s suspension. After Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz and Williams’s Alex Albon came together, bringing out the safety car for a second time, Verstappen pulled away on the restart. Lando Norris of McLaren was 3.879 sec behind in second, with George Russell of Mercedes third in a race complicated by showers, crashes and safety cars."

He said a problem with his car’s power unit had wrecked his hopes of a strong race despite starting from 11th on the grid, one place ahead of Sainz, as the team experienced their first failure to reach Q3 since 2021. “Honestly, there’s not much more to say apart from the engine issue cost us everything,” he said. “At one point, we decided we tried to go on the slicks – we had to try something because with our engine issues we would have been out of the points anyway. “That was it really. We were losing a second and a half on the first straight, so we’ve got to look into the engine issue because it’s going to be tricky for the rest of the season.” He said he wanted to avoid any over-reactions. “As much as we didn’t overreact after Monaco, we shouldn’t over-react after this one, but this one hurts. “It’s big points for the team with the two cars DNF’d that we are going to lose against our competitors. And yeah, engine-wise, it’s something that we need to look at. “Yesterday, we missed Q3 by three hundredths of a second. We were definitely not feeling good with the car and we’ve got to work on that and try to understand what went wrong.”"

Fifty-six years after team founder Bruce McLaren claimed their maiden win in the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix, the modern duo’s result ended a decade of pointless results at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. “Podium at the Canadian Grand Prix,” wrote team boss Zak Brown in a social media post. “Lando P2 and Oscar P5 delivering a haul of points! Excellent skill from the drivers out there in tricky conditions. We gave the win our best shot, but luck wasn’t on our side.” Norris shrugged off any disappointment he felt at not winning, having built a solid lead before the first safety car intervention when a delayed pit-stop cost him the race lead. “It was wild. It was chaotic. It was eventful,” he said. “I felt I drove a good race. I had amazing pace and then the safety car had me over, just like it helped me in Miami. But it was good fun overall. “Things were going beautifully, but it’s Montreal so there’s something that comes into play – and fair play to Max, he drove a good race. It’s what it is.” Piastri said: “On a weekend where things could’ve gone very, very wrong, coming out with as many points as possible is a great result, but we’re always chasing perfection. “So it’s about just a few things we could’ve done better, minor things, which in a race like that would’ve made a big difference.” “It was very tricky, just trying to keep the car on track!”"

    "article_content": "Published By : Ritayan Basu AFP Last Updated: June 10, 2024, 10:31 IST Montreal F1: Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton (AP) Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton said he had driven “one of the worst races” of his long career on Sunday when he finished fourth behind Mercedes team-mate George Russell in the Canadian Grand Prix. Hamilton said he believed his car was capable of winning, but that he had made a lot of mistakes in his 341st race, in which Russell passed him in the closing laps to snatch away his first podium finish this year on one of his favourite tracks. “Over the weekend, it’s a poor performance from myself,” he said. “Some other things came into it yesterday, mostly myself, but then today, it’s one of the worst races I’ve driven. Lots of mistakes. “Of course, if I qualified better, I would have been in a better position… “But it is becoming a car we can fight with and that’s a real positive, going into the next part of the season. It’s going to be a close battle and if I get my head on right, I’ll get better results. “I think this weekend the car was capable of winning. That’s such a great feeling so we’ll take the points and keep on trying.” Hamilton holds the joint record of seven wins and six poles at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve where he claimed his maiden victory, with McLaren, in 2007. Russell, who had started from the second pole position of his career and the team’s first since Hamilton’s pole at Hungary last year, said: “This feels like a missed opportunity. We were really quick at the beginning on the inters and then Lando came through really fast, but then we jumped back onto the slicks and made a couple of mistakes, pushing the limits and paid the price. “Nevertheless, it was our first podium of the year, we had a really fast car and to be back in the mix fighting for a victory, that’s what F1 is about.” Asked about his two late bold passing moves on McLaren’s Oscar Piastri and Hamilton, Russell added: “It was pretty tight with Oscar and Lewis at the end. It was hard, but fair racing. “It’s so difficult when there’s only one dry line, so you have got to be committed and trust your rivals.” Team boss Toto Wolff said despite missing out on a first win since the Sao Paulo Grand Prix in 2022, he was satisfied with the team’s recent progress. “A victory was maybe a long-shot, or a short dream, but you must not be too greedy. The car has made a good step forward and the development direction is true.” He added that he was not sure if Red Bull had “made a step backwards” but that “the most important thing” is that their performance advantage was shrinking."

(AP Photo) Lewis Hamilton’s shock pre-season revelation he was quitting Mercedes to team up with Charles Leclerc at Ferrari next season set the Formula One driver market rumour mill spinning faster than ever. A host of drivers on the grid have now been left on tenterhooks waiting on the man seven-time champion Hamilton is replacing at the Scuderia, Carlos Sainz, to announce his next move. “Carlos is the cork in the bottle. We are all waiting for him to make a move, then all the pieces in the puzzle will fall into place,” Haas driver Kevin Magnussen said on Thursday. Also Read: Serbia Salvage Draw Against Slovenia Sainz dashed any hopes his paddock rivals may have entertained of announcing a decision this weekend at his home Spanish Grand Prix. “The latest news is I will take a decision very soon,” he said. “I don’t want to wait any longer, it has taken up space in my head for a few month now. “But I’m not clear in my mind, I’m not sure one way or another. “I’m discussing it with my (management) team, I need a couple of quiet days at home. “It’s been a very hectic couple of weeks, I’ve not had time to take a decision yet,” he added. A straight swop with Sainz moving to Mercedes appears unlikely. If F1’s rumour mill is anything to go by Mercedes are reportedly sweet on replacing Hamilton with their F2 teenage driver Kimi Antonelli to team up with George Russell in 2025. One possible new employer for Sainz, who won in Australia this season, is Williams, taking Logan Sargeant’s seat alongside Alex Albon. Sauber, due to become the Audi F1 factory team, are also interested in the Spaniard. Alpine are shedding Esteban Ocon for next season, with teammate Pierre Gasly’s position yet to be confirmed. At Haas, Nico Hulkenberg is moving on to Sauber next year, leaving uncertainty over the futures of Sauber’s current pairing Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu. Magnussen’s Haas contract expires at the end of this season, with Oliver Bearman set to join the Ferrari-powered team. The Ferrari-academy youngster excelled when standing in for the appendicitis-hit Sainz in Saudi Arabia, and will be behind the wheel of Hulkenberg’s Haas in opening practice in Spain on Friday. Yuki Tsunoda has a contract extension until at least 2025 at Red Bull’s junior team RB, but there is a question mark over whether Daniel Ricciardo will still be alongside him next term. Ricciardo was in the points last time out in Montreal. “I needed a result like that in Canada,” he said. “I’d like to stay in the Red Bull family, I really don’t see myself anywhere else, but I have to earn my place,” he added. Fernando Alonso is fully committed to the Aston Martin project with the Spanish veteran signing until at least the end of 2026. And it is hard to see team owner Lawrence Stroll sacking his son and Alonso’s teammate Lance. McLaren are sticking with their exciting duo Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri while Sergio Perez has just signed a new two-year deal to remain three time world champion Max Verstappen’s teammate at Red Bull.

(AFP) Home hope Carlos Sainz topped the times for Ferrari in a tight and tense final practice ahead of Spanish Grand Prix qualifying on Saturday. Sainz led Lando Norris, who as the one-hour session came to an end, was inexplicably clipped by Charles Leclerc in the other Ferrari triggering an investigation by race stewards. Sainz set a fastest lap of 1min 13.013sec to best Norris by 0.03sec, Leclerc, Max Verstappen’s Red Bull and George Russell for Mercedes. Russell’s teammate Lewis Hamilton, who had topped Friday’s practice, also had a date with the stewards after an incident involving the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll who appeared to deliberately drive into the seven-time champion. The top four were split by less than a tenth of a second opening up the possibility of a thrilling four-team fight for pole for this 10th round of the season later. READ MORE: Carlos Sainz ‘The Cork in The Bottle’ in F1 Driver Market Jigsaw Norris was sitting pretty in second as the session drew to a close when Leclerc surged past him, the man from Monaco then clipping the McLaren despite acres of track room. “He just drove into me, I think I’ve got damage,” Norris told his team. Hamilton was first out on the sun-drenched circuit in Catalonia, and the Mercedes driver had the track to himself for the first five minutes until Verstappen emerged from the garage to keep him company. After an encouraging Friday when Hamilton topped practice, he posted a 1:14.178. The session was 10 minutes old before the two Ferraris emerged into the circuit. As Hamilton pitted Stroll told his team “Can you get me a knee pad prepared for the next run? I have some knee pain.” Russell went fastest from Sainz, at his last home race weekend for Ferrari, and Leclerc. Norris then went second, following a fire at his McLaren team’s hospitality centre as final practice got underway. READ MORE: F1: ‘One of My Worst Races,’ Says Lewis Hamilton After Missing Podium “This morning we evacuated our team hub paddock hospitality unit following a fire alert, the team has been safely evacuated while the local fire brigade handles the issue,” McLaren reported. Leclerc was feeling far happier after a sluggish Friday practice, telling his team: “Good job on the car. It is a good step forward” after both upgraded Ferraris failed to finish last time out in Canada. “Happy to hear that,” replied his engineer. Halfway through the hour-long run, Russell remained in control but like Stroll had issues with knee pain resulting from the high-speed corners. Norris climbed to the top of the pile inside the closing quarter of an hour before Sainz delighted the partisan crowd with his chart-topping lap and Leclerc tangled with Norris. Verstappen, who leads Leclerc by 56 points in the drivers’ standings, won his maiden Grand Prix at the circuit in 2016 and is on a three-timer after also winning the race in 2022 and 2023.

(AFP Photo) Star Indian pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty received a major boost ahead of the Paris Olympics as they secured the men’s doubles title at the Thailand Open Super 500 badminton tournament with a straight-game win over Chen Bo Yang and Liu Yi of China in Bangkok on Sunday. In the form of their lives, Satwik and Chirag, the world number three pair prevailed 21-15, 21-15 over Liu and Chen, ranked 29th, for their ninth BWF world tour title. It was also the second title of the season for the Asian Games champions following their triumph at the French Open Super 750 in March. They had also finished runners-up at Malaysia Super 1000 and India Super 750. “Bangkok has always been special for us, we won our first Super Series title back in 2019 here and also the Thomas cup, so it has been a special place and so happy to be here,” Chirag said after the win. For Satwik and Chirag, the title comes at a major juncture of their career as they had some low returns in the last couple of tournaments. The Indian pair lost in the second round at All England Championships and then missed the Asia Championships due to an injury to Satwik.

However, it was always going to be a tough task to tame the top-seeded Indians, who didn’t allow the Chinese to get into long rallies or sustain any pressure. Satwik and Chirag made a superb start by quickly opening up a 5-1 lead. Chen and Liu clawed back with a four-point burst. At 7-7, the Chinese pair won a 39-shot rally and surged ahead to 10-7 before spraying one long. Liu and Chen played a few intense rallies but Chirag unleashed a bullet return to draw level at 10-10 but Liu ensured they had a slender edge at the break. Satwik and Chirag moved to 14-11 after resumption before Satwik sliced one to net. The Indians extended the lead to 16-12. Liu sent a lob over Satwik’s head to set up a point, while Chirag sprayed into net as the Chinese kept snapping at their heels. However, the Indians soon grabbed five game points with Satwik sending one to the corner and then dishing out another superb service which the Chinese could only bury into the net. The Indians made a solid 8-3 start after the change of sides and maintained the five-point cushion at the interval when the Chinese dumped one into the net. Chen and Liu registered three straight points but Satwik broke the run of play with an aggressive return. At 15-11, Satwik received warning for delaying the game and with Chirag overhitting twice, Chen and Liu moved to 14-15. But the Indians dashed any hopes of a mutiny with Chirag setting up a point with a fine placement and Satwik providing the finishing touch as they moved to 17-15. Liu then sprayed into net as the Indians again eked out a three-point gap. Satwik then unleashed a barrage of smashes to grab five match points. The Chinese then sent Chirag’s smash into the net. As part of celebrations, Satwik broke into a dance with his racquet, while Chirag threw his shirt into the crowd."

(PTI Photo) Back from a break, P V Sindhu will look to hit the right notes in her quest for some confidence-boosting wins ahead of Paris Olympics when she spearheads India’s campaign in the Malaysia Masters badminton tournament starting in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday. Sindhu, a former world champion, returns to the international circuit after skipping the Uber Cup and Thailand Open, and she will aim to go deep in the women’s singles draw of the BWF World Tour Super 500 event. The 28-year-old from Hyderabad hasn’t been able to hit top form after recovering from a knee injury sustained in October last year. A silver and bronze-winner at the Olympics, Sindhu’s return hasn’t been smooth and she has endured a series of narrow losses. Sindhu has just two quarterfinal finishes to show in her six competitive appearances so far. The last title win for her came in the 2022 Singapore Open though she did come close to claiming the Spain Masters last year when she reached the finals in Madrid. Sindhu, who had also suffered a stress fracture on her left ankle en route to the 2022 Commonwealth Games gold, will look to hit the ground running when she opens against Scotland’s Kirsty Gilmour this week. Top stars such as An Se Young, Chen Yu Fei, Akane Yamaguchi or Carolina Marin are not participating this week and Sindhu will be desperate to test her preparation against the next generation players, who have troubled her recently.

Ashmita Chaliha, Aakarshi Kashyap and Malvika Bansod too will look to produce some good results after having been in the circuit for quite sometime now. Chaliha has played some quality matches against the likes of Han Yue and Aya Ohori, both of whom she had pushed to three games recently. In men’s singles, Kiran George is the lone Indian in fray and he will open against Japan’s Takuma Obayashi. While Thailand Open champions Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty have opted out and it will be a chance for Krishna Prasad Garaga and Sai Pratheek K to show their prowess in men’s doubles. In mixed doubles, the husband-wife duo of B Sumeeth Reddy and N Sikki Reddy, and Sathish Kumar Karunakaran and Aadya Variyath would be carrying India’s hopes."

(PTI Photo) Returning from a break, two-time Olympic medallist P V Sindhu progressed to the women’s singles second round with a straight-game win over Scotland’s Kirsty Gilmour at the Malaysia Masters Super 500 badminton tournament here on Wednesday. World No. 15 Sindhu, who had skipped the Uber Cup and Thailand Open, notched up a 21-17, 21-16 win over Gilmour, who is ranked 22nd, in the opening-round match that lasted 46 minutes.

In mixed doubles, B Sumeeth Reddy and N Sikki Reddy, world No. 53, also advanced to the second round after outlasting Hong Kong qualifiers Lui Chun Wai and Fu Chi Yan 21-15 12-21 21-17 in 47 minutes. The husband-wife duo will have the task of taming the top seeds Chen Tang Jie and Toh Ee Wei of Malaysia next. For Sindhu, it was her third win over Gilmour, a two-time medallist in the Commonwealth Games. The 28-year-old Sindhu was quick to open up a 7-1 lead but Gilmour managed to claw back at 14-14 and 15-15. The Indian, however, dashed her hopes of a challenge as she grabbed six of the next eight points to take the first game. After the change of sides, Sindhu was more ruthless as she didn’t allow her opponent to make any comeback after once again gaining an early 3-0 lead. Sindhu was 11-6 at the break and kept moving ahead to grab eight match points. To her credit, Gilmour saved four match points before Sindhu sealed the match comfortably. Sindhu, a former world champion, has endured a series of narrow losses ever since returning from a knee injury early this year. She is eyeing a good show here to boost her confidence ahead of the Paris Olympics."

(AFP Photo) Two-time Olympic-medallist PV Sindhu survived a scare before prevailing over Korea’s Sim Yu Jin in three games to enter the quarterfinals of Malaysia Masters Super 500 badminton tournament in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) on Thursday. World No. 15 Sindhu, a former world champion, saw off Sim 21-13, 12-21, 21-14 in a 59-minute women’s singles second-round match to register her third win over the Korean world number 34. The 28-year-old from Hyderabad hasn’t been able to hit top form ever since returning to action following a knee injury sustained in October last year. Also Read: Sports Ministry Approves Foreign Training for Sindhu And Lakshya Sindhu, seeded fifth, will next face top seed Han Yue in a revenge match. The Chinese had defeated her in their last meeting at the Asia badminton Championships in Ningbo last month. Sindhu, who last won a title in 2022 Singapore Open, has an overwhelming 5-1 head-to-head record against Han, who is now ranked world number 6. Sindhu was left to do the catching up job in the opening game as she trailed 3-7. But she fought her way back and grabbed a slender 11-10 advantage at the break. The Indian then reeled off seven points to run away with the opening game. The second game was a tight affair as the two fought hard with Han managing to take a one-point advantage at the interval. She snatched the momentum after resumption. The Korean was soon up 14-10 and went on to win seven of the next nine points to roar back into the contest. Sim once again made a positive start to move to a 5-1 lead in the decider. But Sindhu clawed back at 6-6 before the Korean was up 9-8 at one stage. The Indian then took control and zoomed to 13-9 before a five-point burst from 16-14 to seal the contest. In other results, the mixed doubles pair of B Sumeeth Reddy and N Sikki Reddy lost 9-21 15-21 to top-seeded Malaysian pair of Chen Tang Jie and Toh Ee Wei, while Simran Singhi and Ritika Thaker went down 17-21, 11-21 to second-seeded Malaysians Pearly Tan and Thinaah Muralitharan in women’s doubles."

Fifth seed Sindhu, who has not won a title in two years, rallied to prevail 13-21 21-16 21-12 against world number 20 Busanan in a marathon semifinal that lasted 88 minutes to close in on the BWF World Tour Super 500 crown at the Axiata Arena. Sindhu had won the 2022 Singapore Open and finished runner-up at Madrid Spain Masters last year. It was her 18th win over Busanan, who has beaten the Indian only once in her career way back in 2019 Hong Kong Open. World No. 15 Sindhu, who will be eyeing her third Olympic medal at the Paris Games in two months time, will face second seed and world no. 7 Wang Zhi Yi of China in the summit clash. Sindhu had lost to Wang at the Arctic Open last year but has defeated the Chinese twice in three meetings. A silver and bronze medallist in the last two editions of the Olympics, Sindhu seemed to have found her mojo back as she dished out some attacking badminton this week after looking out of sorts since making a comeback from a knee injury early this season. It has been a while since Sindhu has defeated big guns such as Carolina Marin, Tai Tzu Ying, Chen Yu Fei and Akane Yamaguchi — whom she is expected to come across at the Paris Olympics. A title triumph here will provide her a major boost ahead of the Summer Games. Despite her overwhelming record against Busanan, it turned out to be a tough fight for Sindhu as she had to do the catching-up job, with the Thai dominating the proceedings in the opening game. Spectacular in the opening game, Busanan completely lost control in the decider as she was erratic and struggled with her court coverage while Sindhu looked aggressive. The Indian grabbed eight match points with Busanan going to net again and when Busanan again went wide, Sindhu raised her arm to mark a subdued celebration."

(AFP Photo) PV Sindhu’s wait for a much-needed title extended further as she faltered in the finishing line, going down in three games to world no. 7 Wang Zhi Yi of China in the summit clash here on Sunday. Fifth seed Sindhu, a double Olympic medallist, last won the Singapore Open and Commonwealth Games in 2022 and finished runner-up at the Madrid Spain Masters in 2023. The title looked within the star Indian shuttler’s reach when she held a massive 11-3 lead in the decider after winning the opening game but the former world champion imploded after the final change of sides to go down 21-16 5-21 16-21 in a 79-minute women’s singles final. The title would have been an icing on the cake but the world no. 15 Sindhu’s impressive run to the final will still give her a lot of confidence as she looks to put the finishing touches ahead of the Paris Olympics. It was her first final on BWF world tour after more than a year. Also Read: Deepika Returns Empty-handed From Archery WC Sindhu, a double Olympic medallist, used a combination of poise and power to dominate the proceedings against the reigning Asian champion Wang for most part of the match but everything fell apart after the break in the decider as the USD 420,000 crown slipped out of her hands. A silver and bronze medallist in the last two editions of the Olympics, Sindhu had lost to Wang at the Arctic Open last year but has defeated the Chinese twice in three meetings. Interestingly, it was Wang against whom Sindhu had won the finals during her last BWF title at the Singapore Open. On Sunday, Sindhu was leading 11-3 at the interval in the third game but she fell into a pool of errors after the change of sides as Wang won 18 off the next 23 points to seal the trophy in her name. World No. 15 Sindhu, who will be eyeing her third Olympic medal at the Paris Games, has looked subdued since making a comeback from a knee injury early this season. It has been a while since Sindhu has defeated big guns such as Carolina Marin, Tai Tzu Ying, Chen Yu Fei and Akane Yamaguchi — whom she is expected to come across at the Paris Olympics. But the 28-year-old from Hyderabad, who now trains at the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy in Bengaluru, looked in fine fettle this week but the loss against Wang from a winning position is something which she would have to address in the coming months. Sindhu will next compete at the Singapore Open super 750 tournament starting on Tuesday."

(AFP Photo) Top Indian shuttlers, including PV Sindhu, HS Prannoy and Lakshya Sen, will look to hit top gear at the USD 850,000 Singapore Open, beginning here on Tuesday, with an additional objective of fine-tuning their preparations for the Paris Olympics. The Summer Games are just two months away and the Olympic-bound shuttlers will have three more tournaments — Australian Open super 500, Indonesia Super 1000, Canada Open super 500 — to hone their skills and shake off any cobwebs ahead of the quadrennial mega event. Also Read: Harmanpreet Hat-trick Guides India to 5-4 Win Recently-crowned Thailand Open champions Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty have looked in the best shape for the Olympics, while Sindhu too has geared up with a runner-up finish at the Malaysia Masters on Sunday. Lakshya and Prannoy will also hope for a deep run into the event to receive the ideal boost in the build-up to the Paris Games. However, it will be a tough test of their temperament as some big guns stand in their way in the Super 750 tournament. Sindhu’s first final appearance in a BWF World Tour event in more than a year will serve her well but the meldown in the decider after leading 11-3 to eventually lose the final against China’s Wang Zhi Yi is something which will worry her camp. The two-time Olympic medallist will have to quickly recover from the gut-wrenching loss as bigger battles lie ahead for her this week. She opens her campaign against Denmark’s Line Hojmark Kjaersfeldt. A win is likely to pit her against Rio Olympic champion Carolina Marin of Spain. Satwik and Chirag regained their world no. 1 status after sailing through in Bangkok without dropping a game but the duo is likely to be tested this week. The Indian pair have been in the form of their lives with four final appearances so far this season and they will look to continue the good run when they open against Denmark’s Daniel Lundgaard and Mads Vestergaard in men’s doubles competition. In men’s singles, Lakshya had sneaked into the Olympic qualification with two back-to-back semifinal finishes at French Open and All England Championships. The youngster is coming off a break and will face the tall task of taming world no. 1 Viktor Axelsen, who won the Malaysia Masters on Sunday. Eighth seed Prannoy, who is recovering from a health issues, had a forgettable outing in his last tournament when he was ousted by compatriot Meiraba Luwang Maisnam in the opening round of Thailand Open. Prannoy, a world championships and Asian Games bronze medallist, will have to find his best footing when he opens against Belgium’s Julien Carraggi. Among others in fray, Kidambi Srikanth will square off against Japan’s fifth seed Kodai Naraoka, while Priyanshu Rajawat will meet Hong Kong’s Lee Cheuk Yiu in men’s singles. In women’s singles, Aakarshi Kashyap will face Thailand’s Pornpicha Choeikeewong in the opening round. Olympic-bound Ashwini Ponnappa and Tanisha Crasto also will hope for a good outing as they take on Polina Buhrova and Yevheniia Kantemyr of Ukraine in their opener. Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand will clash with Chinese Taipei’s Cheng Yu-Pei and Sun Yu-Hsing."

Sindhu had last won a BWF title at Singapore two years back and she entered the tournament after signing off with a runner-up finish at Thailand Open last week. Up against world no. 21 Line Hojmark Kjaersfeldt of Denmark, the Indian registered a 21-12 22-20 win in a 44-minute opening round to set up a mouth-watering battle against Rio Olympic champion Carolina Marin of Spain. World No. 3 Marin has an overwhelming 11-5 record against the Indian. The last time the two clashed, it turned out to be an ill-tempered match at Denmark Open which saw both players receiving yellow cards for verbal exchanges. World no. 14 Lakshya, who will be making his Olympic debut at the Paris Games, fought hard but lost steam after the change of ends in the decider to go down 13-21 21-16 13-21 in 62 minutes against Axelsen, who won his first title of the season at Thailand Open last week. Kidambi Srikanth’s opening round match ended in agony as he retired after lagging 14-21 3-11 against Japan’s fifth seed Kodai Naraoka. In other results, B Sumeeth Reddy and N Sikki Reddy lost 18-21 19-21 to Malaysia’s Goh Soon Huat and Lai Shevon Jemie in mixed doubles, while Venkat Gaurav Prasad and Juhi Dewangan lost 8-21 8-21 against Mads Vestergaard and Christine Busch in another match. Sindhu vs Line Sindhu held a 3-0 head-to-head count against Line but things started on an even note as the two were tied 8-8 at one stage before the Indian grabbed a two-point advantage at the break with a fine drop shot. The Indian moved to 16-11 with some quick points as Line made too many unforced errors during the testing rallies. Sindhu soon held eight game points and converted it with a straight return. After the change of sides, Sindhu continued the momentum to open up a 5-1 lead before taking an 11-7 cushion at the interval, with Line finding the net. However, the Dane slowly clawed back at 14-14 and stood four points away from taking the match to the decider, but Sindhu stepped up the pace in time to dash her hopes as she reeled off six straight points to seal the win. Lakshya vs Axelsen Lakshya looked a tad sluggish as he fell behind 1-4 against Axelsen, who rode on his attack to dominate the rallies. The Indian struggled with his length and also his defence lay in tatters against the Dane, who grabbed a massive 11-3 lead at the break. Axelsen soon took 10 game points and though Lakshya saved three of them, he missed a net shot to hand the opening game to the Dane. Lakshya showed better initiative in the second game as he tried to close out the net and go for attacking returns at the backline. He drew parity at 9-9 after being 6-9 at one stage. The momentum shifted after the interval with Lakshya stepping up as he grabbed 14-12 lead. The Indian’s smashes started finding their mark as he moved to 18-14. The Dane seemed a bit frustrated and made poor judgements as Lakshya grabbed five game points and roared back into the match with a superb net dribble. Lakshya dominated the front court battle to open up a 6-3 lead. The Dane clawed back at 7-7 as he started to dominate the net now. Two miscued lifts and a wide push handed Axelsen a one-point advantage at the interval. All fell apart after the resumption as Axelsen grabbed 8 off the next 9 points to move to 19-11 and then grabbed eight match points with a smash. Axelsen closed out the match with a body return."

This was the world number 30 Indian duo’s maiden win from three meetings against the world number two Korean pair. The Baek-Lee duo was error prone as Treesa and Gayatri held a commanding 18-9 lead before taking the opening game without much fuss. But the Indians allowed the South Koreans to bounce back, committing unforced errors in the second game as the match went to the deciding third game. The rival pairs exchanged some powerful smashes and were locked 8-all before the Indian duo took a slender two-point lead at the final mid-game break.

Both Sen and Antonsen played their hearts out till 18 points in the second game, not willing to give an upper hand to the other.

Antonsen will play eighth-seed Kunlavut Vitidsarn of Thailand in the semifinals."

(PTI Photo) Captain Harmanpreet Singh led from the front with a sensational hat-trick as the Indian men’s hockey team recorded a thrilling 5-4 win over Argentina in the FIH Hockey Pro League here. Besides Harmanpreet (29’, 50’ and 52’), Araijeet Singh Hundal (7’) and Gurjant Singh (18’) also scored for India, while Federico Monja (3’), Nicolas Keenan (24’), Tadeo Marucci (54’) and Lucas Martinez (57’) were on target for Argentina on Sunday. Also Read: Guardiola Vows Revenge as City Celebrate Title Triumph India made a good start, keeping the ball for most of the first quarter and came up with accurate passes to make their way into the Argentina striking circle. However, Argentina drew first blood when Federico found the back of the net from a close range to give them a 1-0 lead. In response, India equalized quickly as Araijeet scored a brilliant field goal. India also earned a penalty corner but failed to capitalize on it as the first quarter ended 1-1. India started the second quarter on a high note. The fast counter-attacking aggressive approach helped India extend their lead after Gurjant scored an excellent field goal. India were slightly dodgy the next few minutes after scoring the goal as they gave up possession and were punished when Argentina broke into a quick counter, making their way through the left flank. It was Nicolas Keenan who drove into the Indian circle, beating the defenders to strike the ball into India’s goal levelling the score at 2-2. However, India earned a PC with a minute remaining in the quarter and Harmanpreet made it 3-2 in India’s favour. The third quarter was entertaining with both teams displaying quick-fire hockey. India secured a penalty corner but couldn’t convert it as Harmanpreet’s shot was blocked well by the Argentina goalkeeper. With both teams defence standing tall, the third quarter remained goalless. India came out in top gear in the fourth quarter as they pushed Argentina to make errors, leading to a PC being awarded with 10 minutes remaining. The decision was changed to a penalty stroke and Harmanpreet’s low powerful shot found the back of the net as India took a 4-2 lead. Two minutes later, India were awarded another penalty stroke, which was again successfully converted by Harmanpreet. Argentina pulled two goals back in quick succession as Tadeo and Lucas found the back of the net to set up an exciting finish to the game. The match ended with India winning 5-4.

(X) The Indian men’s hockey team is headed to Paris 2024 with an aim to build on the incredible Bronze medal finish in field hockey at Tokyo 2020. T20 World Cup winner Dinesh Karthik spoke to India men’s hockey goalkeeper PR Sreejesh on JioCinema’s ‘Get Set Gold’, where the legend opened up on his career and how he ended up as a hockey player. Sreejesh let Karthik know that if you want to be a goalkeeper in field hockey, you have to be somewhat “crazy” to perform at the highest level. “The goalkeeper has to be a crazy person. Crazy, because you just need to have that guts to stand in front of that ball. The second thing is aggression, you need to be an aggressive person, and those reflexes have to be there. You don’t get much time to just think, ‘Save.’ No, you just need to save it. Then you realize, ‘Okay, I made that save.’” Sreejesh revealed he had to get through some other sports before coming across hockey. “I was a shot-put athlete in my school days because I was overweight with a lower height. So, my team was better than me. Then I went for football, but there were a lot of football players already packed on that ground. I tried volleyball, but I was not good enough. Then I saw hockey.” Even though he started playing hockey to try and get grace marks on his Kerala State board exam, he carefully picked his lane when he realized he didn’t have the physical tools to be an outfield player. “Hockey was not easy because you need to bend, you need to play. That was really tough for me. And over that, you need to run. I was an overweight guy. I didn’t like running at all. So, I’ve seen these goalkeepers in full kit, standing in a corner and kicking the ball. I thought that was pretty funny because they’re not doing anything. They’re not running. They’re just wearing the pad and kicking the ball. So, I thought this was the right position for me because you don’t need to run. You’re a part of the hockey team and you’ll get grace marks. That’s how I became a goalkeeper.” Sreejesh rewrote Indian hockey history, becoming the only men’s player from India to win the World Games Athlete of the Year (2021). The goalkeeper has won 16 international medals, including the Olympic Bronze (2020), two Asian Games Gold medals (2014, 2022), two Commonwealth Games Silver medals (2014, 2022), and four Asian Champions Trophy Gold medals (2011, 2016, 2018, 2023), among other accomplishments. Sreejesh is expected to represent India in men’s field hockey at Paris 2024. India has been seeded with Belgium, Australia, Argentina, New Zealand, and Ireland in Group B of the tournament, as they hope to make a deep run into the medal rounds."

(IANS) The Indian women’s hockey team went down 2-3 against Great Britain in their second match of the London leg of the FIH Hockey Pro League 2023/24 at the Lee Valley Hockey Stadium. Navneet Kaur (34’) and Sharmila Devi (56’) scored the goals for India, while for Great Britain, Charlotte Watson (5’ and 7’) and Isabelle Petter (57’) were on target. In the first quarter, India started the game with a dominating presence, putting the hosts Great Britain on the backfoot and entering their territory swiftly. Despite India’s attempts to ease this pressure by counter-attacks, Great Britain maintained their momentum, and scored early through Charlotte Watson (5’) after she found the back of the net from a penalty stroke. Charlotte Watson (7’) was again on the scoresheet as she doubled Great Britain’s lead finding the back of the net from a close range. At the start of the second quarter, the Indian team increased the frequency of their attacks in an attempt to get back in the game, forcing Great Briain’s midfielders to make back passes and maintain possession. Interestingly, the strategy helped Great Britain in neutralising the Indian team’s attack, allowing them to maintain their 2-0 lead going into the half-time break. With India desperately trying to find ways to bounce back, the third quarter was entertaining with both teams displaying quick-fire hockey with both teams stepping up the ante in attack. India’s efforts paid off as Navneet Kaur (34’) pulled one back for India after scoring a brilliant field goal. With India switching gears, they put Great Britain’s defenders on the backfoot with their high pressing, but a second Indian goal remained elusive. The third quarter ended with hosts Great Britain leading 2-1. High on confidence after scoring, the Indian team came out all guns blazing in the fourth and final quarter of the match and kept Great Britain under pressure by attacking rigorously. However, the hosts kept their defence tight. Sharmila Devi (56’) pulled back another one for India and made the last few minutes of the game exciting. However, it was Great Britain which extended their lead after Isabelle Petter (57’) found the net. The match ended with Great Britain winning the match 3-2. The Indian team will next take on Germany on June 8."

In London, India beat Germany 3-0 before going down 1-3 against Britain in their second match. “The entire team knows that the London stage of the FIH Hockey Pro League 2023/24 matches are very important in our preparations for the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympics. “Therefore, it is important that we don’t take anything for granted and give our best out there,” Hardik said."

    "article_content": "Published By : Vivek Ganapathy PTI Last Updated: June 08, 2024, 17:22 IST United Kingdom (UK) Germany beat India 4-2. (X) The Indian women’s hockey team could not break its sequence of half-a-dozen consecutive losses in the FIH Pro League, losing to Germany 2-4, its seventh consecutive defeat in the tournament on Saturday. The Indians squandered a two-goal advantage when Sunelita Toppo and Deepika scored excellent field goals in the opening quarter to give the Harendra Singh-coached side the best chance to break the jinx. Sunelita (9th) and Deepika (15th) scored superb field goals to give India a huge morale-boosting 2-0 lead but soon saw it being cancelled out by Germany’s Viktoria Huse, who converted penalty corners in the 23rd and 32nd minutes to bring her team on level terms. Stinne Kurz (51st) then converted a penalty corner before Jule Bleuel scored a field goal in the 55th minute to pile on more misery on the Indians. The latest defeat comes after India had lost all their four matches against Belgium and Argentina in Antwerp last month and then succumbed to defeats against Germany (1-3) and Great Britain (2-3) here last weekend. Stung by half-a-dozen losses over the course of a fortnight, India started much better on Saturday with Lalremsiami leading the way in the initial minutes. The veteran forward first created some space to drag the ball into the circle and then took a powerful shot at the goal, only for German goalkeeper Julia Sonntag to thwart it in the nick of time. The Indian midfield then set up a perfect ball for an unmarked Sunelita in the ninth minute as the teenaged midfielder put it across Sonntag to give world No.5 India the lead. Deepika then gave a proper lesson on how to score on the counter when she deftly snatched the ball in the midfield and ran forward with Vandana Katariya for company. Vandana drew Sonntag out before relaying the ball to Deepika who tapped it in with ease just two seconds before the end of the first quarter. However, German penalty-corner specialist Viktoria converted two penalty corners, one each in the second and third quarter, as India’s lead evaporated. Deepika made some good runs into the circle in the second half, but was unable to time her shots for maximum impact. The last quarter of play was a story of complete domination for German forwards who unleashed a barrage of attacks to overpower the Indian defence. India will play Great Britain in their last Pro League match on Sunday."

(X) The Indian women’s hockey team went down fighting 2-3 to Great Britain in their FIH Pro League match on Sunday, extending their run of losses to eight matches. India thus ended their Pro League season with a heartbreaking defeat to the home team, having played well for the majority of the match before Grace Baldson (56′ and 58′) quick-fire brace snatched victory for Great Britain. Two calls went against go against India, including a video review leaving coach Harendra Singh frustrated. With the score reading 2-2 and the final hooter approaching, Badlson struck the winner — a powerful drag flick hitting the bottom corner. Badlson thus broke Indian hearts once again three years after scoring the winner at the Tokyo Olympics that gave Great Britain the bronze medal. Her strikes also prevented India from winning their first match under Harendra. Lalremsiami scored a field goal for India in the 14th minute after Watson Charlotte put Britain in lead with her third minute strike. Kaur Navneet was the goal-scorer for India, finding the target in the 23rd minute. It was a much-improved performance by the Indian side but not enough to beak their run of defeats. “These are not the results what we want. We are upset about today’s result. We came back from a goal down, we needed to be calm in the end. “When we came here, we had to play attacking hockey. The four matches in Belgium, we were defensive. We did that in London, but of course our defence needs to better,” said goalkeeper Savita Punia. “It means a lot to Indian hockey that we keep our place in the Pro League, because otherwise we don’t get enough matches. Not happy with performances, but happy that we remain the Pro League,” she added."

(X) Veteran goalkeeper PR Sreejesh pulled off a stunning save from penalty spot but that was not enough as India, who conceded just 38 seconds into the match, lost 2-3 to Great Britain in the men’s FIH Pro League hockey match on Sunday. The result meant the Craig Fulton-coached Indian team ended its campaign with a loss to the hosts. The Indian side was stung by a Phil Roper strike right at the start of the game but regained its composure and came close to scoring on a couple of occasions only to be thwarted by the Great Britain defence in the first quarter. However, the visitors found the equaliser through Sukhjeet Singh’s (19′) excellent strike four minute into the second quarter. Displaying hockey of the highest quality, Sukhjeet dived in to deflect the ball into an empty net after getting Gurjant Singh involved down the left. If the home team looked better in the first quarter, the Indians controlled the game in the second quarter as the two teams went into half time with the score locked at 1-1, which was a fair reflection of the contest. Britain were awarded a penalty stroke after Sanjay was adjudged to have deliberately infringed on attacker Nick Bandurak’s space as he received the aerial ball. It looked like a harsh call, but India didn’t review it. Standing on goal, Sreejesh then came up with one of the finest saves to deny the hosts and keep India in the contest. As Wallace unleashed a powerful stroke, an agile Sreejesh moved to the right at breakneck speed to prevent the Englishman from scoring. This was after Sreejesh had made a spectacular save at the beginning of the match after India had already conceded. Having got a penalty stroke, India skipper Harmanpreet Singh led by example as he made no mistake and firmly slotted the ball past the Engish goalkeeper, sending him the other way to put the visitors ahead in the 36th minute. Jack Waller restored parity almost immediately as he produced a fine goal after an aerial ball was received by Nurse on the right. Roper laid it off for Waller inside the circle and he smashed that past substitute goalkeeper Krishan Bahadur Pathak who had no chance to save that. Meanwhile, Mandeep Singh missed an easy chance after an excellent aerial ball from Hardik down the left flank to Sukhjeet, who played the ball forward. Mandeep just had to deflect into an open goal, but he failed. That miss by Mandeep hurt the team as Alan Forsyth scored what proved to be the winner for Britain in the 50th minute."

Jarmanpreet has been a constant feature under chief coach Craig Fulton, starting every match of the Asian Champions Trophy Chennai 2023, the Asian Games Hangzhou 2022, the Test matches against South Africa and Australia, and all FIH Hockey Pro League 2023/24 matches, except the game against Germany on June 8, where he took to the pitch in the second half. “The chemistry in the team is exceptional. We have regular player meetings off the pitch where we discuss previous games and ways we can help each other on the pitch,” Jarmanpreet said in a Hockey India release. “The whole team is pulling in the same direction, and I feel we are in good rhythm. Like all the other players, I always try to give my best on the pitch and hope to make the squad for the Olympics. It would be a matter of great pride for me and my family if I play in my first Olympic Games at the Paris 2024 Olympics—a dream come true. If I do get selected, my aim would still be to give my hundred percent for the team, as the team always comes first.” He debuted in the 2018 Men’s Hockey Champions Trophy in Breda, where India finished second. Since then, he has played 106 matches and amassed several accolades, including winning the gold in the 2018 Men’s Asian Champions Trophy in Muscat, Oman, and clinching the silver medal in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. Jarmanpreet also won the gold medal with the Indian Men’s Hockey Team in the Asian Games in Hangzhou in 2023. The 27-year-old has just returned from a splendid outing in the FIH Hockey Pro League 2023/24 in Antwerp and London, where he had the honour of playing his 100th international match when India took on Belgium on 24th May. He was also named Player of the Match when India trumped Germany 3-0 on 1st June, thanks to his constant threat on the right flank and a sublime assist that helped Gurjant Singh score, in addition to his tireless defensive duties. Reflecting on his recent performances, the defender said, “The FIH Hockey Pro League 2023/24 matches in Antwerp and London turned out to be a good experience. We had the opportunity to test ourselves against different teams that employ various structures. These matches helped us pinpoint areas for improvement in our game while also reaffirming our strengths. Winning the Player of the Match against Germany was a pleasant feeling. It is imperative to perform well in the build-up to a major tournament as it helps build confidence, and I’m glad to receive recognition for my performances. But as a player, improvement never stops, and the aim is to improve further in the upcoming camp to be close to my best version for the Paris 2024 Olympics.”"

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz’s buildup took a hit when he lost in the second round of Queen’s Club on Thursday. Alcaraz, the defending Queen’s champion and top seed, lost to Jack Draper 7-6 (3), 6-3. For Draper, the British No. 1, it was the biggest win of his career. He was impressively composed in front of his home crowd. Queen’s was Alcaraz’s only grass-court preparation last year en route to winning Wimbledon for the first time. But this time the Spaniard will have only two grass matches under his belt following his French Open victory. Wimbledon starts in 11 days. Draper ended Alcaraz’s eight-match win streak while extending his own to seven after winning his first ATP title last week in Stuttgart. Draper didn’t drop serve against Alcaraz. They were finally separated in the first set in the tiebreak, where Draper shot to 4-0 then 6-1. Alcaraz netted a return to concede the set. Alcaraz suffered the only break in the sixth game of the second set, after Draper’s backhand return serve down the line. Draper saved a break point to hold for 5-2, then Alcaraz saved three match points to hold. Draper served out and threw his arms in the air. “I knew I had to come out here and play really well, and luckily I did that,” he said on court. He faces fifth-seeded Tommy Paul in the quarterfinals.

Alcaraz’s preparations for his Wimbledon title defence suffered a setback on Thursday with his 7-6(3) 6-3 loss to Draper in the last 16. The 25-seconds shot clock, aimed at reducing the time taken between points, was previously started only when the chair umpire called the score but media reports said a rule tweak sees the countdown to a serve begin almost immediately after a point is concluded. The reports said the new regulation was on trial for the last 10 days and players had been informed about it. Alcaraz said he had no time to go through his regular routine during the match and that he had expressed his concerns to chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani. “He told me that there is a new rule, this new thing, that the clock never stops. After the point is finished, the clock is putting on,” he added. “I think for the players it’s something bad. I finish the point at the net and I had no time to ask for balls. I’m not saying to go to a towel and take my time. I feel like I can’t ask for the balls. “It’s crazy. I have time just to ask for two balls and no bounces. I’ve never seen something like that in tennis. “If you play a long point or finish at the net, you have time just to go for a towel or ask for your routine, ask for, in my case, four balls, I’m concentrating on the next point, just bouncing my bounces and serve as best as I can. “Today I felt like I was in a rush all the time. I had no time to bounce and do my routine.” Reuters has contacted the ATP for comment. The French Open champion was asked if he had spoken to the governing body. “Not yet, but I will, for sure,” said Alcaraz, who will now head to Wimbledon, which begins on July 1.

Germany’s Struff unleashed 18 aces and saved 16 of 18 break points but still went down to a 6-2, 6-7 (1/7), 7-6 (7/3) loss to the Italian. “It was a very tough match,” said Sinner. “I had chances in the second, had chances in the third, but couldn’t use them. “I just try to accept these kind of challenges.” Sinner will next face China’s Zhang Zhizhen who came back from 2-5 down in the final set to defeat Christopher Eubanks of the United States 6-4, 4-6, 7-5. Germany’s Alexander Zverev edged closer to his first grass-court title with a come-from-behind victory over Arthur Fils in his quarter-final. French Open runner-up Zverev, the world number four, came through 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 6-4 against his French opponent. The 27-year-old, a two-time finalist at Halle, becomes the first man since Roger Federer in 2019 to reach back-to-back semi-finals at the tournament. “After the French Open, I was hoping on grass I would play a bit quicker and not play for two-and-a-half, three hours every single match, but I’m continuing what I always do,” said Zverev. Zverev will take on 2022 champion Hubert Hurkacz for a place in the final. Poland’s world number nine defeated Marcos Giron of the United States 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 on the back of 42 winners, including 11 aces. Stay updated with the latest from Euro 2024 .

    "article_content": "Published By : Siddarth Sriram IANS Last Updated: June 22, 2024, 13:20 IST New Delhi, India Andy Murray (AP Photo) Two-time Wimbledon champion Andy Murray will undergo a crucial back operation just nine days before the prestigious tournament begins on July 1. This follows his unfortunate withdrawal from the Queen’s Club Championships earlier this week, where a back injury forced him to retire after only five games against Australia’s Jordan Thompson in the second round. Murray’s management issued a statement revealing the imminent procedure, while also leaving his Wimbledon prospects hanging in the balance. “Andy is having a procedure on his back tomorrow (Saturday). We will know more after this has taken place and will update further as soon as possible,” said the statement. The former World No. 1, who remarkably continues to compete with a metal hip, struggled visibly during his match against Thompson. He reported a disturbing weakness in his right leg and a loss of coordination, an issue that marks a departure from his usual left-sided back troubles. “Like all tennis players, we have degenerative joints and stuff in the back but it’s all predominantly been left-sided for me my whole career,” Murray explained. “I have never had too many issues with the right side. So maybe there is something that can be done between now and then to help the right side.” This back surgery is not entirely new territory for Murray, who previously underwent minor back surgery in 2013. However, his current predicament follows a challenging period marked by injuries and recoveries. He recently returned to the court in May after nearly two months sidelined with an ankle injury, only to face another setback at the Queen’s Club. Stay updated with the latest from Euro 2024 .

Nagal’s meteoric rise over the past year has seen the 26-year-old’s ATP ranking jump up to 71, which is the joint-fourth highest ranking achieved by an Indian men’s player since the introduction of the computerized system of rankings in 1973. His recent impressive performances were the reason behind the massive jump in rankings. After making his French Open debut at the Roland Garros in which he was eliminated in the first round at the hands of Karen Khachnov, Nagal went on to win the Heilbronn Challenger in Germany before just missing out on a consecutive title win at Perugia challenger in Italy as he lost to Luciano Darderi ( 6-1, 6-2) in the finals of the tournament. It is important to note all three tournaments were played on clay courts in Sumit’s attempt to prepare for the upcoming Olympics which will also be played at Roland-Garros, the mecca of clay courts. Before the Olympics, India’s highest-ranked star will be fully focussing on the Wimbledon that is scheduled to begin on July 1 where he will be entering the tournament as a part of the main draw for the very first time.

(X) Tommy Paul won an all-American clash with Sebastian Korda on Saturday to set up a final showdown with Italy’s Lorenzo Musetti at the Queen’s ATP tournament in London. Paul, the fifth seed, triumphed 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) and will overtake Taylor Fritz as the new American number one if he wins his third tour-level trophy on Sunday. Musetti, 22, survived a fightback from Australia’s Jordan Thompson to win 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 in two hours and 18 minutes to advance to his third final and first on grass. “I am happy and I feel every time I step on grass I learn something and play a little better,” said Paul, 27, who is preparing for his third final of the season. “I felt like I did a pretty good job today.” Paul recovered from letting slip a 5-2 lead in the second set to seal his win in a tie-break, avenging his quarter-final defeat to Korda in ‘s-Hertogenbosch last week. Korda also lost in the semi-finals at Queen’s last year Musetti holds a 7-1 record on grass this year, having advanced to the semi-finals in Stuttgart last week. The Italian struck 14 winners and hit just four unforced errors in the decider, sealing victory on his first match point. “That was definitely one of the toughest matches of this week. Jordan was playing at an amazing level, especially in the second and third set,” said 30th-ranked Musetti. “It was key for me to hold serve at the end and I’m really proud of what I’ve achieved this week.” “It would be super nice to win here in Queen’s with so much history,” added the Italian. “I love this sport. I’m really passionate about tennis since I was a kid. I dreamed to be a tennis player and become number one in the world. “There are a lot of Italians here in London, I really feel like I’m at home.” Thompson, ranked 43rd, needed treatment for a back problem and had to battle from a set down to take the match to a decider. Musetti grabbed the decisive break when the Australian’s volley landed just out, and held serve to love before collapsing in delight. Stay updated with the latest from Euro 2024 .

(X) Olympics bronze medallist wrestler Bajrang Punia has received a formal “notice of charge” from the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) for refusing to provide a urine sample. As a result, a multiple World Championships medallist, has once again been provisionally suspended by NADA. NADA had on April 23 suspended Tokyo Games bronze medallist wrestler for refusal to give his urine sample for dope test during the selection trials held in Sonepat on March 10. World Governing body UWW had also suspended him. Bajrang had appealed against the provisional suspension and NADA’s Anti-Disciplinary Doping panel (ADDP) had revoked it on May 31 till NADA issues the notice of charge. Swinging to action, NADA on Sunday served the notice to the wrestler. “This serves as a formal notice that you are being charged with the violation of Article 2.3 of the National Anti-Doping Rules, 2021 and now you are provisionally suspended,” said NADA’s communication to Bajrang. Bajrang has time till July 11 to request for a hearing or accept the charge. The elite wrestler has maintained that he never refused to give sample but only demanded to know NADA’s response to his email where he sought answer why expired kits were sent to take his samples in December 2023. NADA also explained the reason for its action. “Chaperone/DCO had duly approached you and informed you that you were required to provide a urine sample for dope analysis purposes. “Even after several requests made by the DCO, you had refused to provide your urine sample on the ground that you would not provide the sample unless NADA replies to your email regarding the issue of expired kits, which were used by the concerned DCO who had come to collect the sample of the athlete for the dope test about two months ago. Following your refusal to submit to sample collection, the DCO of NADA had also explained to you in detail, about its consequences and outcomes under the NADR, 2021. “Despite all the efforts made by the DCO, you had refused to submit for the sample collection.” NADA made it clear that of Anti-Doping Rule Violation (ADRV) is upheld. It will seek “disqualification of results in the event during which the ADRV occurred, commission of the ADRV with all resulting consequences including forfeiture of any medals, points and prizes.” The NADA may, at their discretion, also elect to recover from Bajrang the financial costs associated with the ADRV and or impose a fine as provided in the NADR, 2021.

(X) World number one Jannik Sinner won his first ever grass court tournament on Sunday beating former champion Hubert Hurkacz 7-6 (10/8), 7-6 (7/2) in the Wimbledon warm-up ATP Halle tournament. The 22-year-old Italian went to the top of the ATP rankings thanks to his semi-final run at the French Open this month. “It means a lot. It was a tough match against Hubi,” said Sinner after playing his doubles partner. “I knew I had to serve really well and you play only a couple of really important points throughout the whole set. So I was happy and I tried to produce in the best possible way in the important moments. “I’m very happy about this tournament because [winning for] the first time on a grass court, it’s a good feeling.” The triumph means Sinner is the first player since Andy Murray in 2016 to win his first tournament after becoming world No.1. The fifth-seeded Pole Hurkacz, 27, won Halle two years ago and was chasing a second title of the season after winning on clay at Estoril in April. There were no service breaks in the match but Sinner won 85 per cent of his service points compared to only 69 per cent for Hurkacz. In the second-set tie-break Sinner took the early lead and never relinquished his advantage to claim a fourth title of the season as Hurkacz missed a final backhand.

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung) Tommy Paul added his name to a list of American tennis greats in winning the Queen’s Club tennis title after defeating Lorenzo Musetti 6-1, 7-6 (10/8) in Sunday’s final. Victory gave the fifth-seeded American his third ATP tour title — and biggest success of his career — after he won in straight sets after 88 minutes on court in London. Paul became the first United States player to win the prestigious Wimbledon warm-up tournament since Sam Querrey in 2010 as he joined a group of former American champions at Queen’s, including John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors and Pete Sampras — who all won Wimbledon as well. “It means everything,” said Paul, who knocked out Britain’s Jack Draper in the quarter-finals. “Going through the hallways here in the locker room and the names on the wall, it’s unbelievable. It was my goal always to put my name next to them.” The world number 13 will also overtake compatriot Taylor Fritz to become the new American number one, with Wimbledon starting on July 1. Paul raced through the first set before Italian opponent Musetti worked his way back into the match. The 27-year-old Paul failed to serve out the match at 5-4 up in the second set before coming back from 1-4 down in the tie-break and saving a set-point at 6-7. Musetti saved two match points behind his own serve before Paul took the third to secure the title. “This was definitely one of the nicest weeks of my career so far,” said Musetti. “Congratulations to Tommy, he deserved to win. I was struggling to get to his level. I saved face a bit at the end with the break. I was fighting really hard to get to the third set.” The 22-year-old, who became a father to his first child in March, added: “I want to dedicate this week to my little boy Ludovico. I just want to go back and hug him.” Stay updated with the latest from Euro 2024 . Explore Euro 2024 Match Today. Check Updated list of Highest Goal-Scorer in Euro 2024 .

    "article_content": "Published By : Siddarth Sriram AFP Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 08:43 IST United States of America (USA) Christian Pulisic shone the brightest for USA with a goal and an assist (AFP) Christian Pulisic scored one goal and set up another as the United States launched their Copa America campaign with a clinical 2-0 Group C victory over Bolivia on Sunday. US captain Pulisic curled in a superb early goal before teeing up a second for striker Folarin Balogun just before half-time at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington. That two-goal salvo was enough to secure a vital three points for US coach Gregg Berhalter’s side, who also face in-form Uruguay and regional rivals Panama in the group stage. “We came out flying with a lot of intensity,” Pulisic said afterwards. “Obviously an early goal helped us a lot, but all around a pretty dominant performance. “We could have scored a few more to put it away, but all in all a really good start to the tournament. We should build some confidence from this; the games are going to get harder from here so we’ve got to be ready.” Berhalter had warned his team against complacency against a Bolivia side who had won only one game in nine previous editions of the Copa America since 1999. Pulisic was clearly in no mood to let the South Americans improve that record of futility, firing the hosts into the lead after only three minutes. Receiving the ball from a corner on the left, the American captain darted towards the edge of the area and whipped a rasping shot goalwards. Bolivia goalkeeper Guillermo Viscarra got a hand to it but could not stop the ball flying into the roof of the net. Yet despite that early breakthrough, the US struggled to convert their dominance of possession into chances thereafter and were frustrated by a combative Bolivian team who saw three players booked in the first 31 minutes. Leonel Justiniano, Gabriel Villamil and Luis Haquin were all shown yellow cards by Italian referee Maurizio Mariani in an indisciplined start by Bolivia. The US doubled their lead in the 44th minute and once again Pulisic was heavily involved. Picking up the ball near halfway, the AC Milan forward accelerated towards the Bolivia penalty area and squared to Balogun, who took a touch to drag defender Jesus Sagredo wide before drilling a low shot into the bottom corner. The superior movement of the US forward line continued to cause problems for Bolivia after the restart. Balogun just failed to get a toe on a low shot by Tim Weah in the 50th minute and had the ball in the net moments later but was adjudged marginally offside. Pulisic then drew a fine save from Viscarra in the 60th minute after weaving into the penalty area and unleashing a ferocious shot. Substitute Ricardo Pepi should have made it 3-0 in the 65th minute moments after coming on for Gio Reyna, but saw his shot from an Antonee Robinson cross roll wide. Pepi was then denied a goal in the 90th minute after a desperate double save by Viscarra. The US play Panama in their second game of the tournament on Thursday.

(AP Photo/Joan Monfort) Max Verstappen steered his Red Bull to victory at the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday to increase his lead in the Formula 1 drivers championship. Verstappen started from second on the grid behind pole-sitter Lando Norris. But the three-time champion whipped past the McLaren driver by the first turn and then overtook George Russell on lap three of 66 and never looked back. Norris tried to mount a late challenge but Verstappen upped the pace to cross first. Norris was second, followed by Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes in third. Verstappen said that his moves to get past Norris and Russell so early proved crucial so he could build an advantage and keep the hard-charging Norris at bay. “I think what made the difference in the race was the beginning,” Verstappen said. “I took the lead and had my buffer. After that we had to drive a defensive race.” Verstappen got his seventh win in 10 races this season and claimed his third straight victory at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalonia. Verstappen has 219 points. Norris moved into second place with 150, overtaking Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, who fell into third place with 148 points after finishing fifth. Norris put the blame on his poor start — when he lost two spots — for having to settle for second. The British driver got his first win at Miami in May and was gunning for a second victory. “I should have won,” Norris said. “I got a bad straight, it is as simple as that.” Hamilton’s third place was the first podium of the season for the seven-time world champion, who is in his last season for Mercedes before joining Ferrari next season. Norris was beaten from the starting line by Verstappen and Russell, who whipped around both rivals from his start from fourth on the grid to take a surprise lead after the nearly 600-meter (yard) run to the first corner. Verstappen was right behind Russell, however, and within two laps he swerved past him just after his team told him “(this) might be our best opportunity now.” Once ahead, Verstappen managed his tires on the tough Barcelona track, and his Red Bull team pulled off two clean pit stops to avoid any mistakes. Norris showed his great form by chasing down both Mercedes after a tire change. He got past Hamilton and then featured in a long duel with Russell midway through the race. Norris swerved past, Russell counterattacked to edge ahead, before Norris finally got in front. But the jousting also favored Verstappen, who added to his lead. Norris turned up the speed over the final 10 laps and was closing on the Dutchman, but he ran out of time and track. He crossed two seconds behind Verstappen. Russell finished fourth, while it was a bad day for Leclerc and Carlos Sainz as neither Ferrari could contend with the front-runners. Sainz, the Spanish fan’s best hope for a win, finished sixth. Norris’ McLaren partner Oscar Piastri was seventh. Sergio Pérez in the other Red Bull was eighth after his start from 11th place following a third-place grid penalty incurred in last round’s Canadian GP. Alpine pair Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon rounded out the top 10. Fernando Alonso was 12th in his Aston Martin. Stay updated with the latest from Euro 2024 . Explore Euro 2024 Match Today.

    "article_content": "Published By : Vivek Ganapathy AFP Last Updated: June 23, 2024, 20:41 IST United Kingdom (UK) Andy Murray. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell) Two-time Wimbledon champion Andy Murray has been ruled out of this year’s tournament after undergoing back surgery, the ATP Tour confirmed on Sunday. “After an operation on a spinal cyst, Andy Murray is sadly out of Wimbledon. Rest up and recover Andy, we’ll miss seeing you there,” the ATP said on X, formerly Twitter. The Scot had been aiming to make a farewell appearance at the grass court Grand Slam, which he won in 2013 and 2016. However, the 37-year-old will need an expected six weeks to recover from surgery with Wimbledon starting on July 1. He now also faces a race against time to be fit for next month’s Paris Olympics, with Murray twice a gold medallist in the singles. Murray managed just five games before a back injury forced him to withdraw from his second-round match against Australia’s Jordan Thompson at the Queen’s warm-up event in London on Wednesday. The former world number one, who plays with a metal hip, struggled from the start of his match against Thompson and said afterwards he had a feeling of weakness in his right leg and had lost coordination. “I never had that loss of coordination, control and strength in my leg before,” Murray said shortly after retiring from his match with Thompson. “I’ve been struggling with my back for a while — I had lost the power in my right leg so lost all motor control, I had no coordination and couldn’t really move.” Asked then about his prospects of playing at Wimbledon, he added: “Like all tennis players, we have degenerative joints and stuff in the back, but it’s all predominantly been left-sided for me my whole career. “I have never had too many issues with the right side. So maybe there is something that can be done between now and then to help the right side.” Murray underwent minor back surgery in 2013 and following a first-round loss at the recent French Open he said he would need treatment to address soreness. The three-time Grand Slam champion only returned to competitive action in May after nearly two months out with an ankle injury. He had been due to play singles and doubles with his brother Jamie at Wimbledon before potentially ending his career at the Olympics in Paris. Stay updated with the latest from Euro 2024 .

    "article_content": "Curated By : Siddarth Sriram News18.com Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 13:43 IST New Delhi, India Diksha Dagar and Aditi Ashok (X) Indian golfers Aditi Ashok and Diksha Dagar have officially secured qualification to participate in the Paris Olympics as members of the Indian contingent at Le Golf National. While it will be a third appearance for Aditi at the Olympics which is also the most for an Indian, Diksha will be competing for the second time. For Sharma and Bhullar, it would be their maiden appearance at the Olympics. India’s best performance at the Olympics came from Aditi who finished fourth in the Tokyo Games 2020. The Olympic entries are sent by the Indian Golf Union, and qualification for Olympics is determined by rankings, limited to 60 men’s and as many women’s players through the Official World Golf Rankings (OWGR). The top 15 players in the OWGR are eligible for the Olympics with a maximum limit of four golfers allowed from a single country. The Olympic Golf Rankings (OGR) after the top 15 players consists of up to two top eligible players per country, as long as it does not have at least two golfers in the top 15. Aditi, the highest-ranked female player from India, made the cut by acquiring an OGR of 24, while Diksha also sealed her spot by clinching an OGR of 40. Diksha is the only golfer to have appeared in both the Olympics and the Deaflympics, where she is a two-time medallist. The 23-year-old won a silver in 2017 in Turkey and a gold in 2022 in Brazil. She became only the second Indian woman to win on the LET after Aditi Ashok and became the youngest to do so at the age of 18. Both Aditi and Diksha are set to join the likes of Shubhankar Sharma and Gaganjeet Bhullar as the four representatives from India. “It’s a privilege and honour to represent India at the Olympics. It’s a dream come true obviously. We have a very good and experienced team in Gaganjeet, Aditi, Diksha and myself,” stated Shubhankar Sharma. “If Olympic week turns our way, any medal is possible. Personally speaking, my game is trending in the right direction and I am keyed up to deliver,” exclaimed a confident Sharma. (with inputs from agencies) Stay updated with the latest from Euro 2024 .

    "article_content": "Published By : Nibandh Vinod Trending Desk Last Updated: June 24, 2024, 08:03 IST Argentina Known for his mesmerising style of play, Lionel Messi has enthralled fans over the last two decades. (Images: leomessi/Instagram) One of the greatest footballers of all time, Lionel Messi celebrates his 37th birthday today. Known for his mesmerising style of play, the Argentine has enthralled fans over the last two decades. Being one of the most gifted footballers in history, Messi is particularly known for otherworldly dribbling, accurate freekicks, spectacular finishing and supreme leadership quality. Over the years, Messi has amassed several trophies including, UEFA Champions League, Copa America, World Cup and other domestic titles. He has also won a record eight Ballon d’Ors and six European Golden Shoe awards. Today let’s take a look at the 10 most memorable moments of Messi’s illustrious career. Lionel Messi made his Barcelona debut on October 16, 2004. He acted as a substitute against city-rivals Espanyol and played eight minutes. At the age of 17 years and 22 days, Messi became the team’s youngest star to appear in the competition at the time. Lionel Messi made his international debut in August 2005. He came on as a substitute against Hungary. But his international debut turned out to be a heartbreaking one as he was sent off within minutes after seemingly striking Vilmos Vanczak. Lionel Messi took the world by storm after replicating Diego Maradona’s goal of the century in 2007. Playing against Getafe at Camp Nou during the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final, a 19-year-old Messi dribbled past six of Getage’s players to find the back of the net. Lionel Messi won his first major honour with Argentina in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Messi set up the winning goal to lead La Albiceleste to their second straight Olympic gold. They beat Nigeria 1-0 in the final. Lionel Messi was just on a different level during the Champions League final in 2009. Playing in Rome, the Argentine notched a header against Manchester United, eventually winning the match 2-0. This was his first-ever appearance in a Champions League final. Lionel Messi had previously once retired from international football after back-to-back losses in Copa America to Chile in 2016. But the Argentine legend just could not contain his passion for his national side, eventually making a return in August of the same year. Playing against Real Valladolid in 2020, Lionel Messi netted his 644th goal in a 3-0 win for Barcelona. By doing so, Messi broke the record for the most goals scored for a single club. The previous record was held by Brazilian legend Pele who had scored 643 goals for Santos FC. Lionel Messi won his record-extending eighth Ballon d’Or recently. Portuguese legend Cristiano Ronaldo comes next with five Ballon d’Or trophies to his name. Lionel Messi won his first Copa America trophy getting the better of Brazil in the final in 2021. Playing at the Maracana stadium, Argentina clinched a 1-0 win against Brazil. This victory also marked the end of Messi’s long wait for his first major international title. A post shared by Leo Messi (@leomessi) Arguably, the greatest moment of Lionel Messi’s career was winning the FIFA World Cup trophy in Qatar in 2022. Messi scored a brace against France in the final. After a penalty shootout, Argentina emerged as the world champions after a gap of 36 years. Stay updated with the latest from Euro 2024 . Explore Euro 2024 Match Today.

    "article_content": "Curated By : Ritayan Basu News18.com Last Updated: December 04, 2023, 10:32 IST New Delhi, India Neeraj Chopra. (Twitter) Neeraj Chopra became India’s first ever world champion this year, two years after becoming his country’s first Olympic champion in athletics. Chopra’s first outing of the year set the tone for the rest of the season. With his first throw of the competition at the Wanda Diamond League meeting in Doha, he sent his spear out to 88.67m to defeat world and Olympic medallist Jakub Vadlejch. He notched up another Diamond League victory one month later in Lausanne, winning with 87.66m. Chopra’s season ended on a high at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, where he successfully defended his title with a season’s best of 88.88m, leading an Indian 1-2 finish from compatriot Kishmore Kumar Jena. Even though he has not yet been to touch his landmark distance of 90m, Neeraj has always maintained the time will come. And it is surely close. In an interview with The Indian Express, Neeraj was asked how he knows when he managed a ‘good throw’. “I have been training for 12 years. If you train for something this long and are constantly thinking about it, you naturally develop that understanding. Now the body knows if it is a good throw. Those early instinctive celebrations come automatically. The early celebrations don’t come if the throw isn’t good. Most throwers have that feel. In long jump, you will see (Murali) Sreeshankar or Jeswin (Aldrin) realise how their jump will go the moment they take off,” Neeraj Chopra was quoted sa saying by TIE. ALSO READ | ‘If Kenya and Grenada Can…’: Neeraj Chopra Calls for Increase in Marketability of Athletics in India When asked about the controversial first throw at the Asian Games, which was not registerd due to technical issues at the venue. Neeraj Chopra said, “It was 88m-plus for sure, not 90m.” Neeraj also express his wish to compete in a major international event on home soil, given the fact the he hasn’t comepted in India after securing Olympic Gold, he said.”I have a strong desire to compete in India. I really want India to host a big international event and the federation is also trying. Everyone is keen on seeing India host a big-ticket event. I hope it happens in the future and I am really looking forward to competing in India against international athletes in front of fans.”"

    "article_content": "Published By : Ritayan Basu News18.com Last Updated: December 04, 2023, 13:16 IST Pune, India AFC Champions League: Mumbai City FC's Rahul Bheke (X) Mumbai City host Uzbek side PFC Navbahor Namangan the final game of Group D of the 2023-24 AFC Champions League as action returns to the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex in Balewadi, Pune on Monday. Mumbai City traveled to Iran in challenging conditions with an all-Indian squad to take on Nassaji Mazandaran in the penultimate group stage game. An early blinder from Mohammed Reza Azadi and an unfortunate own goal from young Halen Nongtdu set the Islanders back early on. The hosts went down to 10-men in the second half as Mumbai City kept piling on the pressure but could not break down the Iranian side’s resolute defence. A 2-0 loss on the road meant Mumbai City have five losses on the trot and will play for pride in Group D in tomorrow’s outing against Navbahor. PFC Navbahor Namangan have enjoyed their maiden AFC Champions League campaign with a neck to neck battle for top spot in Group D. The Uzbek side hosted the four-time AFCCL winners on matchday 5 as the two sides were locked on the same points at the top of the table. However, Al Hilal got the best of the hosts as goals from Malcom and Salem Al Dawsari helped their side to a 2-0 win to open up a three-point gap at the top of Group D. With the Islanders set to participate one final time in the 2023-24 AFC Champions League, coach Anthony Fernandes addressed the media in Pune and highlighted his side’s intention to finish their continental campaign on a positive note. “We would like to finish our campaign on a positive note. Even in the last two training sessions, the positiveness and eagerness to play this match is as high as as any other match. We need to get into that winning momentum going into the ISL games,” said Fernandes. Lallianzuala Chhangte accompanied Fernandes to the customary pre-match media briefing and echoed the importance of the final ACL challenge. “I think it’s an important game, it will be a challenging game, but we approach this game very seriously because we want to win this game. Since the last few days, we have been doing everything possible to do well in this game and the preparation is well and the atmosphere in the team is very good and we are ready to go give our best,” said the Islanders’ forward. Mumbai City will welcome back JPD and Mehtab who return from suspension as the Islanders reported their full squad available for selection. PFC Navbahor will be without the services of defenders Filip Ivanović and Ibrokhim Yuldoshev who serve suspensions."

We will be reactivating at least nine geographies, which have not seen the Pro Kabaddi League in their own region since 2019.

The Titans’ captain and the most expensive player in the history of the Pro Kabaddi League – Pawan Sehrawat expressed that his team is all geared up for the first game, “I am very excited to step on the mat. It was tough for me to miss out on the last season. However, I have saved up a lot of energy for the upcoming season and I am also eager to face Fazel in the first game. Our players have trained very well for the season through the training camp. We are absolutely ready for our first game against Gujarat Giants.” Meanwhile, the most expensive defender in the Pro Kabaddi League and Gujarat Giants’ captain Fazel Atrachali said, “I am very excited to be a part of the Pro Kabaddi League Season 10. This is the best kabaddi tournament in the world. We can’t wait to start the season. I am very happy to play for Gujarat Giants this year. We have a lot of young talents and a good coach. I am looking forward to a good season.” The Jaipur Pink Panthers clinched the Pro Kabaddi League trophy after defeating Puneri Paltan in the final last season.

Nassiri comes up with some good work to stir up an opening before the ball falls to Sadiku in the middle of the box. The goalscorer sticks a leg through it, but his effort is well off the mark as he skies it instead of keeping it down. Things seem to be getting heated up in the middle as both teams go in search of their second goal of the game to put them clear of their opposition. MBSG pushing up field relentlessly, but EBFC are equal to the task as they hold out well. Ten minutes or so from half time and things are all level at the moment!

The teams pause for a bit as a drinks break is called for, and it is the first sign of the players stopping for a breath ever since the game got underway!

Mohun Bagan draw level again as Armando Sadiku put the ball into the back of the net as he turns a cross into the box home beyond the reach of Prabshukan Gill. Game on at the VYBK.

Unlucky for Ali as he suffers an early blow in the encounter. The opening minutes of the encounter have lived up to the fiery nature of the clash between two of the biggest teams in India. If the early exchanges are anything to go by, we are in for an end-to-end matchup as both teams have thrown numbers ahead into the opposition box. GOAL! East Bengal have drawn first blood in this fierce encounter as they go ahead thanks to Ajay Chhetri. The Red and Gold brigade work the ball well on the left flank before an overlapping run from the wing back opens up some space upfield. A cross is played into the box at the right time and Ajay is at the end of it to poke the ball into the back of the net and send the away fans in the stadium into a state of delirium.

    "article_content": "Reported By : Aparna Deb News18.com Last Updated: June 21, 2024, 15:47 IST New Delhi, India Sensex Sensex Today: Benchmark indices settled lower on Friday. The BSE Sensex closed 269.03 points or 0.35 per cent lower at 77,209.90 levels. Nifty50, on the other hand, slipped 65.90 points or 0.28 per cent to 23,501 levels. On BSE, Bharti Airtel, Infosys were among the top gainers while UltraTech Cement and L&T were among the top laggards. Similarly, on NSE, Bharti Airtel and LTIMindtree were among the top gainers while UltraTech Cement and Adani Ent were among the top laggards. Broader markets also settled lower. Nifty MidCap slipped 0.08 per cent while SmallCap fell 0.17 per cent. Sectorally, Nifty Media was the top gainer, up 0.95 per cent, followed by IT (up 0.76 per cent). FMCG, meanwhile, was the top loser (down 1.20 per cent). Market View: Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. “The market is in a consolidation phase, and this is likely to continue. There are no major triggers for aggressive buying or selling. Even in this consolidation phase the undertone of the market is bullish and, therefore, buying on dips will emerge imparting resilience to the market. Strong up moves will attract profit booking and, therefore, sustained rally would be difficult. Even when the market consolidates, leading private sector banking stocks have the potential to move up further. Large delivery based buying is happening in this segment. This is perhaps the only segment which offers value in this overvalued market.” Global Cues On Thursday, Wall Street stocks retreated from earlier record highs in line with gains seen in international markets, despite soft US economic data. Treasury yields, anticipating new supply next week, rebounded after an initial dip. Meanwhile, the dollar strengthened as higher U.S. yields widened the gap compared to rates in other currencies, which are generally lower. The dollar approached the 160 yen mark, a level that prompted Tokyo to intervene in late April to stabilize its currency."

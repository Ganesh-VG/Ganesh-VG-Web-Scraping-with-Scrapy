Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! इस हफ्ते रिलीज हुई है फिल्म जुग जुग जियो और फिल्म को काफी लोगों ने पसंद भी किया है। खासतौर से मनीष पॉल, जो हमेशा लोगों को हंसाने में यकीन करते हैं, उनकी खूब तारीफ़ हो रही है, ऐसे में हाल ही में जब मेरी मनीष से बातचीत हुई, तो उन्होंने बताया कि बचपन से ही कैसे वह फिल्मों में दिलचस्पी लेने लगे थे और इसके अलावा और भी कई बातें की, मैं उस बातचीत के अंश यहाँ शेयर कर रही हूँ। मनीष कहते हैं कि उन्हें शुरू से ही फिल्में देखने का शौक बहुत रहा है। वह विस्तार से बताते हैं मैं फिल्मों का इतना बड़ा कीड़ा था कि बता नहीं सकता। अमिताभ बच्चन की फिल्में देखने के बाद, तो सीने पर मर्द का टैग लगा कर घूमता था। जब भी मेरे स्कूल में फैंसी ड्रेस कंपीटिशन होता था, मैं अमिताभ बच्चन का ही किरदार निभाता था। मुझे याद है जब मैं अमिताभ सर से मिला था, तो उनसे 786 के उस बिल्ले पर साइन भी करवाया था, यह सबकुछ मेरे लिए फिल्मों में आने की तैयारी जैसा ही था। मनीष ब ताते हैं कि उनके घर में पढ़ने-लिखने का ही माहौल हुआ करता था। वह बताते हैं सच कहूँ, तो घर में मेरे जैसा फिल्म देखने वाला तो कोई नहीं था। मेरे पापा चार्टेड एकाउंटेड थे। लेकिन मैं कभी भी पढ़ाई में मन नहीं लगा पाता था। मैं घरवालों को कहता था कि मुझे पॉकेट मनी मत दो, मगर मुझे फिल्मों के कैसेट खरीद दो। मैं तो फिल्में देखने के लिए पता नहीं क्या कर जाता था। पुरानी फिल्में, पुराने गाने सब सुनता था. मैं राजकपूर की भी फिल्में देखता था, लेकिन सबसे ज्यादा जिस फिल्म ने मुझे छुआ, वह दीवार और अग्निपथ थी। मैं जब भी स्कूल से घर पर लंच खाने के लिए आता था, मैं वीएचएस पर वही देखता था। मैं चाहता हूँ कि अपने बच्चे के साथ यह सबकुछ शेयर करूँ। मनीष पॉल कहते हैं कि वह अपने सीनियर्स से टाइम मैनेजमेंट सीखना चाहते हैं वह कहते हैं मेरा मानना है कि हमारे जेनरेशन के स्टार्स में ऐसा नहीं है कि वार्मथ नहीं है, बस टाइम मैनेजमेंट की कमी है। इसलिए परेशानी होती है। मेरा मानना है कि बिजी रहते हुए भी हमें एक दूसरे को तवज्जो देनी चाहिए। जैसे अर्जुन कपूर अभी शूट कर रहे थे नैनीताल में, मैं भी शूट कर रहा था, तो हम मिल न पाए हों, लेकिन हर दिन हम बात जरूर करते थे। मैं गौर करता हूँ कि अनिल सर को मैं फोन करूँ और उनका कॉल मिस हो जाये, तब भी वह मुझे फोन करते हैं। यह सबकुछ हमें उन लोगों से सीखने की जरूरत है। दरअसल , मनीष का ही ये चार्म है मुझे ऐसा लगता है, जिसके वजह से वह हर स्टार्स के फेवरेट हैं। वह यूं ही चार्म बिखेरते रहें, पॉजिटिविटी देते रहें, मैं तो यही चाहूंगी और उनसे हमेशा पॉजिटिव एनर्जी ही लेना चाहूंगी ."

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! At this point, I would say that the Grand Finale of Bigg Boss 16 is already here and the contestants were in for a treat filled full of twists and turns, with the contestants giving it their all in the face of danger as Rohit Shetty himself comes in the house to select the first contestant of his reality show, “Khatron Ke Khiladi”. But as we know that the fights never stop, Priyanka Chahar Choudhary , went head to head with Shalin Bhanot , with the two of them exchanging heated words. Priyanka accused Shalin of using other female contestants like Tina Datta and Soundarya Sharma to advance in the show, while Shalin countered that Priyanka only wanted “footage” and created the fight for that reason! But, I didn’t mind this fight considering it might be the last fight of the season. Enter the master of stunts himself, Rohit Shetty, who announced that he had come to select the finalist for “Khatron Ke Khiladi 13”. The contestants took turns naming the toughest competitor, with Archana Gautam being picked for her innocent charm by MC Stan , Priyanka naming Shiv Thakare for his strength and vice versa. Archana chooses Shiv, while Shalin selected Priyanka. The first stunt was the “Fear of the Unknown”, with contestants facing black boxes containing unknown objects. Archana started and was scared when she pulled out a vegetable, but in the next box, she felt a bite and backed off. MC Stan also felt a sting, but he gave up. The prankster? A volunteer with a cucumber! A post shared by ColorsTV (@colorstv) The real stunt was an underwater challenge, where contestants had to unlock screws and reach the finish line. MC Stan breezed through the first lock but ran out of breath. Archana struggled but successfully unlocked herself. Shiv triumphed, while Shalin went shirtless and completed the task effortlessly, leaving everyone in awe. Priyanka, however, struggled and gave up. It was time for some fun after the intense task, and Rohit assigned MC Stan to be Archana’s father and Shalin as the suitor. Impersonating his funny voice, he dished out hilarious one-liners and even jokingly roasted Shalin’s love for chicken. Bringing in his rap skills, he skewered both with his “Toqueer Sahab” voice, leaving everyone in stitches. MC Stan’s new avatar is loveable than ever. A post shared by ColorsTV (@colorstv) The game took a hilarious turn with a twist on dum charades, where every wrong guess resulted in a shock from the bands on their hands. Shalin and Priyanka started, and after some shocks, finally guessed Archana’s famous phrase. Archana and Shiv went next, and Archana’s epic reactions to “captaincy” were a sight to behold. In the next round, Archana and Shiv navigated through lasers while blindfolded, with Archana facing plenty of shocks, but with Shiv’s hilarious guidance, they made it to the end. Priyanka and Shalin followed, overcoming shocks and completing the task, emerging as the winners. The final challenge was a race to victory, riding a cycle and collecting cards, all to break a towering glass with a single blow. Priyanka took off with ease, her nimble fingers quickly grabbing the cards. Shalin followed with a flourish, his performance so smooth that everyone was left in awe. But when Shalin was called to the house, he refused, revealing that he had a fear that kept him from continuing the show. Archana protested, saying it wasn’t fair to Shiv who lost his chance because of Shalin. But, I must say that Shalin played very well and certainly deserves to be in “KKK13”. The contestants gave it their all, and it was a nail-biting finish that left everyone on the edge of their seats. The making of grand finale was also shown which made me all excited and has now left me eagerly waiting for d-day. Get ready for more updates and gossip, and don’t forget to grab your popcorn!"

Karan Johar’s “Koffee With Karan” is back with a bang in its eighth season, promising yet another exciting round of candid conversations, shocking revelations, and unfiltered celebrity confessions. The latest episode featured the dynamic duo of Sara Ali Khan and Ananya Panday, two young and talented actresses from Bollywood. In this episode, the audience was treated to an engaging and sometimes eyebrow-raising conversation, as the two actresses had plenty to spill about their personal and professional lives. Take a sneak peek below… A post shared by Karan Johar (@karanjohar) The episode was full of highs as Sara and Ananya dropped some truth bombs and gave us quite an interesting peek into their lives. The episode started off with Karan asking them about what they had to say about dating the same man to addressing rumours about Ananya dating Aditya Roy Kapoor. They also gave us a peek into their friendship and how Ananya is always helping Sara with what are the things she should and should not be saying and that’s a best-friend moment I guess we will all relate to! They also gave us an insight into who Orry actually is and I hope it answered questions of a lot of people out there. The two also dropped some truth bombs on films that worked for them and didn’t and how they navigated through that. Ananya also opened up about how what she lacks at this point in her career is respect and that is what she is trying to earn through her work. The episode also concluded with an interesting rapid-fire round with some very intriguing answers from both the ladies on the couch. The episode highlighted the challenges, aspirations, and camaraderie between these two talented actresses.

A post shared by ColorsTV (@colorstv) Salman starts by teasing Shalin with Tina’s name and the coldness is still there as Tina says that she doesn’t recognize him.

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! After a journey of more than four months in the Bigg Boss 16 house, curtains have been dropped and Salman Khan has finally declared the most-awaited winner of the season and its none other than Bigg Boss 16’s “Basti Ka Hasti” MC Stan . The first runner-up is Marathi Bigg Boss winner Shiv Thakare followed by the second runner up who is the highly opinionated Priyanka Chahar Choudhary and honestly, it actually left me shocked when she got out of the race. From the top five finalists, Shalin Bhanot goes out of the finale race first due to the lack of votes, followed by Archana Gautam who was nothing but entertaining this season. Coming to the winner’s journey, MC Stan has had an amazing one with lots of ups and downs. From entering and getting nominated time and again over not being involved to finding a family and safe space in his very own “Mandali”, MC Stan has always maintained a very strong presence. Whether it be giving savage comebacks or saying “Shembdi” in his “P-Town” language it has made him win hearts. From feeling lonely and wanting to quit the show to bagging the Bigg Boss 16 Winner Trophy, MC Stan has yet again gained success being the self-made man that he is. From a huge fight with Shiv Thakare to being best friends with him their friendship has only bloomed with time. The mandali has attained the ultimate power in this game, it’s always been a rare sight to see a friendship like the mandali’s in the Bigg Boss 16 house. From his love-hate friendship with Priyanka to pulling Abdu Rozik ‘s leg, he has been raw and real throughout the season. This has no doubt made him take the trophy with all pride and is nothing less than deserving. The way he has opened up himself during the last few weeks was just astonishing. Just like MC Stan proudly displays his jewellery and shoes now he can proudly showcase the trophy. A post shared by ColorsTV (@colorstv) Now with the Bigg Boss 16 done, I am wondering what’s next for our winner and one thing I know for a fact is that he is going to shoot out his rap songs like a bullet from a gun. Apart from all this, I am more excited to get the news of his and Bubba’s marriage next! A hearty congratulations to MC Stan and I can’t wait to hear his upcoming songs!"

Well, some of them may just have been answered for you. MissMalini got candid in her latest interview with Tina Datta , who has surely won a lot of hearts with the zeal that she played the game. She makes some interesting revelations about her Bigg Boss journey, read on to find out! Here are 5 revelations Tina Datta made in this interview… 1. She revealed how the first few days were slow inside the house. Since you do not know how you are supposed to spend your 24 hours, and how much you are supposed to talk to people. And also how difficult it is to pass time, especially when you do not have sunlight coming in you do know what your meal time should be. 2. She also states how she never wanted to be a part of Bigg Boss. Her reason for that is that it is not easy to spend three months inside the house without your friends and family. She also tells us that it was her closest friends who told her that you are a survivor, and you can do it. 3. When Malini asked her whether she watches Bigg Boss now that she is out of the house, revealed that she does not watch it and how she has put an end to that chapter of her life once the finale was done. 4. She also revealed that it was Shalin Bhanot’s aggressiveness that put her off, and accepts that she regrets saying ‘Oh I’m going to fall in love with you’ to Shalin, inside the house. And later on, decided to draw a boundary and not be friends with him. 5. In the Rapid Fire game towards the end of the episode, Malini asks the one thing that she does not like about Bigg Boss, to which she responds that she does not like how the narratives are twisted inside the house. There’s a lot more in store for you, check out the video below to find out…"

May it be Monisha from Sarabhai vs Sarabhai in the past, or as Anupamaa. She is now a household name, that everyone seems to love, me being one of them! Her character Anupamaa has been an inspiration to many women, to stand up for themselves and pave a better path in their lives. In an exclusive, Rupali Ganguly spoke to the team of Miss Malini on how her character Anupamaa inspired her and what she has learnt from it. Here’s what she had to say. Her mother and her sister were two women who inspired her the most, but apart from that, Anupamaa’s character has been the most inspirational woman in her life. She added, While my mom and her sister and all the women I have grown up with over the years have always been a big inspiration to my life, my current most important inspirational woman in my life is Anupamaa! I want to thank this beautiful woman for teaching me the importance of self love, which is above all! She taught me that loving your family is definitely priority, but to not forget ourselves too! Her character taught her, that as a mother and a wife, your priority should not just be your family, but also yourself. And how loving yourself, is equally important as loving your family. And in doing so, does not make you a smaller person. She also added, If you feed yourself with love,only then will you be able to give that love to others. Rupali Ganguly from the sets of Anupamaa A post shared by Rups (@rupaliganguly) She also said that she is grateful for all the values Anupamaa has inculcated in her, and continues to do so, every working day. She also mentioned that the beauty of Anupamaa is that she transitions with time and situations while keeping her core value intact. That honestly, is a great skill to pick up. We all have a thing or two, to learn from her."

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! One of the most talked about contestants on Bigg Boss 16 was Shalin Bhanot . You and I know the reasons for it also, and while I thought that Shalin was a strong contender for the trophy, seeing him out at the fifth position was a little disappointing for me. But Bigg Boss truly became a life-changing experience for Shalin. In fact, it even opened up lots of doors and opportunities for the actor. The biggest and the latest one is the Colors TV show Bekaboo which premieres on 18th March. Other than Shalin the show also stars Eisha Singh , Monalisa , Zain Imam , Shivangi Joshi , Shubhaavi Choksey , Chetan Hansraj , and Arjit Taneja . A post shared by ColorsTV (@colorstv) I am going all bekaboo for Bekaboo, because Colors plus Balaji is coming together, on top of that I am playing a monster. Supernatural really excites me all the time, whether a Superman, Spiderman, or now Ranav. The wittiness and grey jokes that the character has are a little similar to what Shalin has. A post shared by ColorsTV (@colorstv) Life has completely changed post Bigg Boss. I was human inside, but I am no longer human or the Shalin that I was. The very next day I became Ranav the monster. After going to Bigg Boss I realized how important it is to be in touch with your loved ones on a daily basis. There are lots of plans to star in films and web-shows, I am waiting for my dream producers and directors like Karan Johar and Sanjay Leela Bhansali to give me a call or give me a five-minute job in their movies. I would love to do that. A post shared by Shalin Bhanot (@shalinbhanot) I have just started with my journey of playing different roles, playing a role like Ranav was something I couldn’t have even dreamt of. So it is beyond a dream role for me, and there is a list of dream roles. I would love to play a drunkard like Amitabh sir, or a blind guy like Al-Pachino , picture toh abhi baaki hai mere dost . Well, I am sure Shalin that this picture will also be a blockbuster and a very long one with various roles for you to play. On that note, wish you the very best for Bekaboo."

She also praised him for successfully stepping into an established character, as he replaced Paras Khalnawat a while ago in this role. She called bidding farewell to his character and Sagar as a co-star heartbreaking, emotionally draining and exhausting as the plot concluded his role in the show ‘Anupama’.

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! With a remarkable contribution in the world of Television series, Palki Malhotra has seen phenomenal success with shows like ‘ Dill Mill Gayye ‘, ‘Dil Dostii Dance’ under her name. The creative producer, writer, producer and dance director is now creating waves with her latest show, ‘Campus Beats’ starring Shantanu Maheshwari , Shruti Sinha, Sahaj Singh Chahal, and Tanvi Gadkari. In a candid chat with MissMalini, Palki talks about the her latest show, the evolvement in the OTT space and more. ‘Campus Beats’ is your second dance show after ‘Dil Dostii Dance’, why and how do you feel this genre connects with the youth? ‘Campus Beats’ is just not the dance show, both the shows have a campus, the rivalry, the connection, the growing up, the coming of age, and living, exploring, and understanding our own life and others. The years when you are actually finding yourself and the external world around you are what you remember the most and you cherish the most. If somebody asks you about your growth, you will always go back to your school days because at that point in time, passion is a key you give so much importance to. So growing up is the most relatable aspect of anybody’s life. And, that is why ‘Dil Dosti Dance’ has worked and I feel ‘Campus Beats’ will also resonate with the audience because it’s not just the genre but also about exploring ourselves. It’s about understanding the world and what you are capable of in the world around you. And then of course there’s a tadka of dance. Youth shows like these will forever connect with the youth. It’s just that you need to understand the show and you need to make it with that purity. Tell us about the idea behind the concept of ‘Campus Beats’? The idea behind ‘Campus Beats’ was that I wanted to make a youth show for the longest time. In 2013, ‘Dil Dosti Dance’ and I parted ways and from then I always had the idea of creating another youth show. But it just took a very long time, the industry was going through a lot of changes, youth channels shut down, and OTT began to bloom. But, the one thing that remained constant was the hunger for youth shows. And when I noticed, that there were not many youth shows offered to the youth of India. The youth started to tilt towards K-Dramas. For me, K-Dramas was something that I thought was exactly what we used to do during our ‘Star One’ or ‘Channel V’ days because ‘Dill Mil Gayye’ or ‘D3’ were pretty much similar to K-Dramas. So that’s when I was aggressively pitching to get back the youth shows, writing them again, and pitching it with the tadka of a thriller. So I thought, why not do a Campus series that can have a thriller aspect with a teen drama. I really thought it was required and the youth of India was really looking for it, which is a pretty clean, fun, relatable, light-hearted drama and that is the reason we came up with ‘Campus Beats’. In the near future, what is the kind of content you are looking at creating in the OTT space? OTT is a very interesting space, you get to do a lot of things. But having said that, there is a particular pattern that OTT sees like for example, if it’s crime, if there is a show which is popular in crime, then there will be a lot of people making a lot of crime shows. So I personally do not want to follow that pattern. I would want to do something very different and offer something very different on board. I like to break patterns. I am that kind of a person. The other thing is that I personally feel that OTT in India, whatever content we are offering is not very tilted towards youth. So I feel, it is required that India needs to make good youth content, homegrown content, not just you know replicate something or remake something. I feel that the youth of India is tilting towards the western side or not just Western I mean, tilting towards international shows, fiction shows, but it is so cool if we can create our own and we can get that madness for our homegrown products. We used to make great shows. We had fantastic shows where the whole youth of India was crazier I mean, they were crazy about so many shows earlier during the good old days of ‘Star One’ and ‘Channel V’ and ‘MTV’ for that matter. As a content creator and producer, would you say the OTT space is a boon for you? OTT has been a boon to almost everybody in the industry, so what it offers is a bridge between TV and films or I would say it offers a middle ground to people. There were a lot of people who were getting frustrated with it, with the kind of work that was happening on TV. They were also getting frustrated because they were probably not getting work in films. So what OTT has done for everybody is offered a mid path. It’s a fantastic way of bringing a different kind of vision on board.What has also happened is that suddenly you know India has come together to watch other content. With the digital boom, the shows OTT have been releasing in plenty, how important is it for you to ensure that your show stands out and stays with the audience? For any creator it is important for their show to stand out, right? It is extremely important. All I can say is that the moment you stop following a pattern you will stand out. So one of the reasons why we are a ‘Campus Beats’, a teen drama amidst so much mystery and thriller that has been launched or is being launched right now, I feel that ‘Campus Beats’ is going to stand out big time. I try my level best to always be different with the kind of stuff that I’m bringing about. I mean it needs to be different from the herd mentality that is going on right now. Even the marketing needs to be different. I mean that’s extremely important to any show. So if you’re talking about, pumping up, pumping numbers, the numbers will also come with the kind of marketing you’re doing. You also need to put a lot of soul into creating content, but also creating a very different kind of marketing for yourself. What’s in store for Palki? For me, it is something where I need to make a difference. I do not believe in making shows, I believe in creating legacies. So I try my level best with whatever show that I bring about, to create a legacy of its own that people talk about even after a decade. And I’m very proud of my previous shows like ‘Dil Dostii Dance’ and ‘Dill Mill Gayye’ where people still till date talk about it and there’s still demand for Season 2. So I believe that no matter what I do, it is going to be me writing, directing or producing anything that I do because I want to create a legacy."

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! मेरा मानना है कि भारत के इतिहास के लिए 25 जून 1983 और हिंदी सिनेमा के इतिहास के लिए 25 जून 1992 , ये दोनों ही दिन ऐतिहासिक हैं, क्योंकि जहाँ इसी दिन 39 साल पहले भारत ने कपिल देव के नेतृत्व में अपना पहला वर्ल्ड कप जीता था, तो दूसरी तरफ शाह रुख खान की फिल्म दीवाना रिलीज हुई थी और हिंदी सिनेमा को अपना नया सुपरस्टार मिला था। इस वर्ल्ड कप ने भारत में क्रिकेट को नई दिशा दी, तो शाह रुख खान ने हिंदी सिनेमा को एक ऐसा सितारा दिया, जिसमें हर फैंस ने खुद को ढूंढा, मैं तो दिल से शाह रुख खान को थैंक यू कहना चाहूंगी कि उन्होंने हमारा इतने सालों तक लगातार मनोरंजन किया है, प्यार दुनिया की सबसे खूबसूरत चीज होती है, उस एहसास से राब्ता कराया है। ऐसे में 30 साल पूरे होने पर शाह रुख ने, एक बार फिर से इंस्टा लाइव के माध्यम से दर्शकों से रूबरू हुए, मैंने तो यकीन मानिए, उनकी आवाज सुनने के बाद, वहीं खनक महसूस की। उनकी कुछ उन्हें बातों को मैं यहाँ शेयर कर रही हूँ, ताकि सनद रहे। शाह रुख साफ़ कहते हैं कि वह फिल्म मेकिंग को 100 मीटर रेस मानते हैं। वह इस बारे में कहते हैं फिल्म मेकिंग 100 मीटर की रेस की तरह है। आप भले ही दो से तीन साल तक ट्रेनिंग लो। कभी आप रिकॉर्ड ब्रेक करते हैं, कभी नहीं कर पाते हैं। कभी आपको परेशानी होती है, कभी आप सबकुछ हासिल कर लेते हैं। कभी-कभी आप बस चुनौती को पूरी करने वाले होते हैं कि कोई और आकर चुनौती पार कर जाता है। तो आप बस अपना बेस्ट देने की कोशिश करते हैं। लेकिन आपको पता नहीं होता है कि दस सेकेण्ड क्या गलती हो जाती है। हमेशा आपकी यही कोशिश होती है कि आप अपना बेस्ट ही दें। फिल्म मेकिंग के बारे में मैं बस यह मानता हूँ कि दुनिया में यह बेस्ट चीज है, जो मैं कर रहा हूँ। शाह रुख खान से जब यह जानने की कोशिश की गई कि उनकी आने वाली तीनों फिल्मों में से उनकी फेवरेट फिल्म कौन सी होगी। उन्होंने यह कहा मेरे लिए हमेशा फिल्म मेकिंग का प्रोसेस खास रहेगा, 90 प्रतिशत बतौर एक्टर मैं अपने काम को एन्जॉय करता हूँ, मेरी हर फिल्म, जिसका मैं हिस्सा हूँ, सभी फिल्में मेरे लिए खास हैं और रहेंगी। मैं इनमें से किसी एक को चुन नहीं पाऊंगा . शाह रुख ने इस बारे में भी बात की है कि उनके लिए स्क्रीन पर सबसे कठिन क्या है। उन्होंने यह कहा मेरे लिए स्क्रीन पर हंसना बेहद कठिन काम होता है, इसलिए मेरी कोशिश होती है कि मैं ऐसे दृश्य न करूँ। शाह रुख ने खुद स्वीकारा है कि वह हमेशा से एक्शन फिल्म करना चाहते थे। उन्होंने यह कहा मैं पठान जैसी फिल्म 26 -27 की उम्र में करना चाहता था, लेकिन 56 साल की उम्र में इसे कर रहा हूँ। मैं एक माचो बन रहा हूँ। शाह रुख खान के जो भी फैंस हैं, वह यह बात जानते होंगे कि शाह रुख का सेन्स ऑफ़ ह्यूमर कितना कमाल का है। ऐसे में उन्होंने अपनी फिल्म पठान में अपनी को-स्टार दीपिका के बारे में क्या कहा है, यह जानना दिलचस्प है। उन्होंने यह कहा मुझे बालों से हमेशा से प्यार रहा है। मेरी हमेशा से चाहत थी कि मेरे लॉन्ग हेयर हों। ऐसे में ऐसा कई बार हुआ है कि इस फिल्म में मेरे और उसके एक जैसे हेयरस्टाइल हो गए हैं। यह पहली बार है, जब मैं अपनी को-स्टार की हेयरस्टाइल चेक करा हूँ, ताकि मैं उसे कॉपी न कर लूँ। शाह रुख खान कहते हैं कि उन्हें कभी ऐसा नहीं लगा था कि वह 30 साल तक इंडस्ट्री में सेलिब्रेट करेंगे। उन्होंने इस बारे में ये कहा मुझे कभी नहीं लगा था कि मैं 30 साल तक इंडस्ट्री में रहूँगा। मुझे लगा था, मैं यहाँ सिर्फ एक साल के लिए हूँ, अगर मैं काम नहीं करता तो शायद मैं जॉब ही करता। इसलिए मैंने मेरी मॉस कम्युनिकेशन और इकॉनिमक्स की पढ़ाई पूरी की। शाह रुख खान ने अपने 30 साल के जश्न को मनाने के लिए, फिल्म सेट ही चुना। उन्होंने इस बारे में बताया यह बहुत ही प्यारा अनुभव है कि मैं अपने 30 साल के सफर को फिल्म सेट पर मना रहा हूँ। मैंने 15 घंटे सेट पर बिताये। मैंने 4 . 30 बजे सुबह शूटिंग शुरू की और 8 . 30 बजे काम खत्म किया। यह मेरे लिए सबसे संतोषजनक और संतुष्ट करने वाली बात है। शाह रुख कहते हैं कि उन्हें फैन, जीरो और ऐसी कई फिल्में करने में मजा आया। लेकिन उनके लिए यह भी अफ़सोस की ही बात है कि दर्शक ने इसे पसंद नहीं किया। वह इस बारे में कहते हैं मुझे जीरो, फैन, रा वन जैसे किरदार को करने में मजा आया, लेकिन यह ऑडियंस के साथ अच्छी नहीं रही। काश कि मैं इन्हें और अच्छे से बना पाता। शाह रुख खान ने अपने फेवरेट निर्देशकों के बारे में बताया है। वह कहते हैं मैं कभी भी किसी ऐसे निर्देशक के साथ काम नहीं करता हूँ, जिन्हें मैं प्यार नहीं करता हूँ। अगर मैं उनसे पहले नहीं मिला होता हूँ, तो मैं उनके साथ एक साल बिताना पसंद करता हूँ। उन्होंने आगे इस बारे में कहा मुझे सेट पर रहना बेहद पसंद है। मैं जो भी फिल्में बनाता हूँ, मैं कोशिश करता हूँ कि कम से कम 140 दिन मैं सेट पर बिताऊं, उस फिल्म के साथ। मैं सेट पर खुश होने में यकीन करता हूँ। मेरे सारे डायरेक्टर्स हैप्पी रहने वाले ही रहे हैं। मैं उन सभी के साथ 99 प्रतिशत एन्जॉय किया है। शाह रुख ने कहा वह एक समय में एक ही फिल्म करना पसंद करते हैं, लेकिन कुछ खास कारणों से अब वह दो फिल्म एक साथ कर रहे हैं। वह इस बारे में कहते हैं मुझे एक समय में एक ही फिल्म करना पसंद है, लेकिन पिछला कुछ साल कठिन रहा है, दो फिल्मों को एक ही समय पर करने में। शाह रुख खान खुद के बारे में कहते हैं कि वह एक आलसी आदमी हैं और इसलिए उनके बच्चे भी उन्हें पसंद करते हैं। वह कहते हैं मैं काफी आलसी आदमी हूँ, मेरे पास अगर काम न हों, तो मैं पूरे दिन बिस्तर पर बिना नहाये, सिर्फ चिप्स और कोल्ड ड्रिंक लेकर बैठ सकता हूँ। इसलिए मेरे बच्चे मुझे बहुत प्यार करते हैं। वहीं उन्होंने अपने स्लीपिंग वाले घंटे के बारे में कहा मुझे पांच घंटे से ज्यादा नींद नहीं आती है और अगर मैं ज्यादा सो जाता हूँ, तो मुझे सिर में दर्द हो जाता है। शाह रुख का मानना है कि फिल्म दिल से का गाना छईया -छईया उनका इतना फेवरेट है कि उसके स्टेप्स हो नींद में भी कर सकते हैं। वह कहते हैं मैं सोने में भी छईया -छईया के स्टेप्स दोहरा सकता हूँ। मैं उन गानों को इतना पसंद करता हूँ, मुझे छम्मक छल्लो भी पसंद है और इन गानों को सुन कर मुझे ख़ुशी मिलती है कि यह मेरे गाने हैं। वाकई, शाह रुख यह आप ही कर सकते हैं कि अपने इंस्टा लाइव की बातचीत में भी आपने, हंसी के फव्वारे, मसाला एंटरटेनमेंट, प्रेरणादायी बातें, अपने निर्देशकों को सम्मान देने की बात, परिवार के साथ वक़्त बिताने की बात, अपने प्रोफेशन के सम्मान की बात और अपनी ख़ुशी और ड्रीम की बात, सबकुछ शामिल कर लिया। मैं इसे आपकी ही खूबी मानती हूँ कि आप एक बेहतरीन कम्युनिकेटर हैं और यही वजह है कि आपसे एक कनेक्ट मैं हमेशा महसूस करती हूँ। ऐसे में मैं तो यही चाहत करती हूँ कि आप और अगले कई सालों तक हमारे दिलों पर राज करें और अगले साल 25 जनवरी 2023 को एक बार फिर से 25 अंक आपके लिए खास हो जाये और आपको 25 जून 1992 वाली ही कामयाबी मिले, फिल्म पठान की रिलीज के साथ। गुड लक शाह रुख ।"

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! मैं इस बात को तो मानती हूँ कि भले ही कबीर खान की फिल्म 83 को बॉक्स ऑफिस पर कामयाबी न मिली हो, लेकिन यह फिल्म हिंदी सिनेमा के इतिहास में हमेशा के लिए कल्ट मूवी के रूप में याद की जायेगी, क्योंकि इस फिल्म ने 1983 में जीते वर्ल्ड कप चैम्पियंस को सम्मान दिया, जिसने भारत में क्रिकेट के लिए सिर्फ जुनून नहीं पैदा किया था, बल्कि पूरे विश्व की नजर में भारत को सम्मान दिलाया था। मैं इस फिल्म को एक दस्तावेज मानती हूँ कि यह फिल्म आने वाले कई जेनरेशन के लिए एक प्रेरणा बनेगी। साथ ही रणवीर सिंह ने जिस तरह से इस किरदार में जान डाली है, उसे देखने पर कई एक्टर्स की पीढ़ियों को उन पर गर्व होगा, ऐसे में 25 जून 1983 पूरे विश्व के इतिहास में एक ऐतिहासिक दिन रहा है। और कबीर खान की फिल्म के बाद, अब 1983 के लीजेंड्री खिलाड़ियों पर ‘द 1983 वर्ल्डकप ओपस कॉफी टेबल बुक लांच की है। इस किताब की सबसे खास बात यह है कि यह 25 किलो की किताब है, जिसमें 1983 में जीते गए वर्ल्ड कप के सारे मैजिकल मोमेंट्स शामिल किये गए हैं। और मेरे लिए तो सबसे मैजिकल मोमेंट यही रहा कि बुक लांचिंग के दौरान, एक बार फिर से 83 फिल्म के प्रीमियर के बाद, कपिल देव समेत सभी लीजेंड्री खिलाड़ियों को एक बार फिर से एक मंच पर देखने का मौका मिला। रणवीर सिंह के करियर की बेस्ट फिल्मों में से एक है 83 , ऐसे में उन्होंने भारत के विश्व कप जीतने की ख़ुशी के 39 वें साल पर कुछ इस तरह से लीजेंड्री खिलाड़ियों के मोमेंट को फिर से याद किया। जी हाँ, यह हर क्रिकेट प्रेमी के लिए ही नहीं, मेरे जैसी क्रिकेट की कम जानकार के लिए भी यादगार शाम रही, क्योंकि एक साथ जब मैंने कपिल देव, मोहिन्दर अमरनाथ, कीर्ति आजाद, मदन लाल, सुनील वालसन, बलविंदर संधु, दिलीप वैंगसरकर, संदीप पाटिल, सैयद किरमानी, श्रीकांत, रोजर बिन्नी और पीआर मान सिंह सभी लीजेंड्री एक साथ, एक मंच पर आये और उन्होंने अपने बेस्ट मोमेंट्स बताये। कपिल देव और उनकी पूरी टीम ने जिस तरह से इस शाम में अपने दोस्त यशपाल शर्मा को याद किया, वह देख कर तो मैं भी इमोशनल हुई, सच कहूँ तो जिस तरह से कपिल ने यशपाल शर्मा की पत्नी को हद से ज्यादा महत्व दिया, वह देख कर, मुझे महसूस हुआ कि कैप्टन इसे ही कहते हैं, जो सबको साथ में लेकर चलते हैं। इस बुक लांच के दौरान, मुझे ऐसा ही लग रहा था, जैसे मैं फिल्म 83 का एक बार फिर से रिकैप देख रही हूँ, कबीर खान ने जिस तरह से पूरी टीम के मोमेंट्स को ऑन स्क्रीन चेरिश किया है, ऑफ़ स्क्रीन मैं देख पा रही थी, जहाँ रवि शास्त्री, सुनील गावस्कर ने वीडियो कांफ्रेंस में होते हुए भी, अपने टीम मेंबर्स के बारे में एक से एक पोल खोले, मैं तो महसूस कर पा रही थी कि इनकी क्या बॉन्डिंग रही होगी। खुद कबीर खान भी बुक लांच में सभी खिलाड़ियों को चीयर अप करने के लिए मौजूद थे, इससे शाम और खास बन गयी। मैं तो सच कहूँ, तो दिल से कबीर खान जैसे निर्देशक को शुक्रिया कहना चाहूंगी कि जिन्होंने हमारे लिए 83 जैसी फिल्म बना कर, इन लीजेंड्री खिलाड़ियों की प्रेरणादायी बातों को हम तक पहुंचाया है, तो साथ ही पेमेंट्ज़ की इस खूबसूरत प्रयास की भी सराहना करना चाहूंगी कि उन्होंने 1983 के ऐतिहासिक जीत पर ऐसी किताब लाकर, एक महत्वपूर्ण दस्तावेज बनाया है, ताकि आने वाली कई जेनरेशन भी इस मोमेंट को हम सबकी तरह ही चेरिश कर सके।"

Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! मैंने मुंबई में पिछले दिनों, जितने भी इवेंट में मैं जा रही थी, वहां एक बंदा चेहरे पर मुखौटा लिए घूम रहा था, मैं भी लगातार यह सोच रही थी कि आखिर ये कौन हैं, तो अब जाकर इस सीक्रेट से पर्दा उठ गया है कि यह एक ईशारा किया गया था मेकर्स की तरफ से कि फिल्म एक विलेन रिटर्न्स , एक बार फिर से दर्शकों के सामने नए रूप और कलेवर में आने जा रहा है और इस बार फिल्म में अर्जुन कपूर , तारा सुतारिया , दिशा पटानी और जॉन अब्राहम मुख्य किरदार निभाते हुए नजर आने वाले हैं, फिल्म की रिलीज तारीख की घोषणा हो गई है और मैं तो इस फिल्म को देखने के लिए काफी उत्साहित भी हूँ। मेकर्स ने बड़े ही दिलचस्प अंदाज में घोषणा की है कि फिल्म एक विलेन रिटर्न्स, 29 जुलाई 2022 को थियेटर में रिलीज होने जा रही है। इस फ्रेंचाइजी की यह फिल्म आठ साल के बाद, अपने नए सीक्वेल के साथ आ रही है। मुझे याद है, रितेश देशमुख ने पहली बार इस फिल्म में नेगेटिव किरदार निभाया और इस फिल्म में उनके परफॉर्मेंस की खूब सराहना हुई। ऐसे में चूँकि यह फिल्म कामयाब रही है, मेरा मानना है कि आने वाली फिल्म से उम्मीदें बढ़नी, एकदम लाजिमी है। बता दूँ कि एक विलेन के 8 साल बाद 70 एमएम पर लौट रहे हैं और इस साल के सबसे बड़े एक्शन थ्रिलर के रूप में देखा जा रहा है। फिल्म के मेकर्स ने सारे कलाकारों का फर्स्ट लुक जारी कर दिया है। और सबके एक्सप्रेशंस देख कर ही इस फिल्म के रोमांच का अंदाजा, मैं तो पूरी तरह से लगा पा रही हूँ। मुझे तो पोस्टर्स में सभी डार्क और इंटेंस नजर आ रहे हैं। पोस्टर में फेमस एक विलेन रिटर्न्स स्माइली मास्क और स्लोगन: ‘हीरोज मौजूद नहीं हैं’ के साथ संजीदा अवतार में स्टार-कास्ट को दिखाया गया है। दिलचस्प बात यह भी है कि इस बार भी इस फिल्म का निर्देशन मोहित सूरी ने ही किया है। हाइ ऑक्टेन एक्शन दृश्यों के साथ-साथ, इसकी कहानी में भी इस बार कई सारे ट्विस्ट लाये गए हैं। साथ ही हमेशा की तरह मोहित ने फिल्म में संगीत को भी खास बनाया है। सिद्धार्थ मल्होत्रा, श्रद्धा कपूर, रितेश देशमुख और आमना शरीफ अभिनीत मूल फिल्म-एक विलेन के आज आठ साल पूरे होने पर निर्माताओं ने फ्रेंचाइजी का जश्न मनाते हुए पोस्टर लॉन्च किए हैं। बता दूँ कि इस फिल्म का निर्माण एकता कपूर और टी सीरीज ने किया है, ऐसे में वाकई देखना दिलचस्प होगा कि इस बार यह फिल्म कैसा रोमांच लेकर आती है।"

Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! अब मुझे ऐसा महसूस हो रहा है कि हिंदी सिनेमा का बेस्ट दौर लौट आया है, क्योंकि हिंदी सिनेमा थियेटर में हर तरह की फिल्में अब रिलीज हो रही हैं, ऐसे में निर्देशक और कलाकार रजत कपूर भी एक नयी फिल्म लेकर आ रहे हैं, जिसका नाम है Rk/Rkay, इस फिल्म में उनके साथ मल्लिका शेरावत भी नजर आने वाली है। फिल्म 22 जुलाई 2022 को ही रिलीज होगी। फिल्म की कहानी फ़िल्मी दुनिया पर ही आधारित है, ऐसे में मेरे लिए तो यह देखना वाकई में दिलचस्प होगा कि फ़िल्मी दुनिया के किस पक्ष को कहानी में दर्शाया जाता है। मैं फिल्म की कहानी के बारे में आपको थोड़ा आइडिया दे दूँ, तो ‘Rk/Rkay’ एक बेचैन रहने वाले निर्देशक (आरके) की कहानी है, जिसने अपनी नई फिल्म की शूटिंग पूरी कर ली है, लेकिन एडिट टेबल पर चीजें बहुत सही नहीं लग रही हैं। आरके के मन में कुछ गलत होने का डर है। और उसका सबसे बुरा सपना सच हो जाता है, जब उसे एडिट रूम से एक परेशान करने वाला फोन आता है, जिसमें कहा जाता है कि फिल्म का नायक प्रोजेक्ट से बाहर निकल गया है, फिल्म के प्लॉट पर नियंत्रण कर रहा है। महबूब की फिल्म खत्म हो गई है- आरके और उसकी टीम को उसे ढूंढना चाहिए और उसे फिल्म में वापस भेजना चाहिए। दिलचस्प बात यह है कि रजत कपूर की फिल्म ‘ Rk/Rkay’ की रिलीज में एक महीना बाकी है, लेकिन इस फिल्म को पहले ही कई अंतरराष्ट्रीय समारोहों में दिखाया और सराहा जा चुका है, जिसमें शंघाई इंटरनेशनल फिल्म फेस्टिवल , फ्लोरेंस में रिवर टू रिवर फेस्टिवल, बुकियन इंटरनेशनल फैंटास्टिक फिल्म फेस्टिवल, ऑस्टिन फिल्म महोत्सव और पुणे अंतर्राष्ट्रीय फिल्म महोत्सव शामिल हैं। रजत कपूर के लिए यह फिल्म खास है वह इस बारे में कहते हैं “Rk/Rkay एक ऐसा आइडिया है, जिसके साथ मैं पिछले दस सालों से जी रहा हूँ। अब जाकर इस कहानी को आकार मिला है। यह एक क्रेजी कर देने वाली फिल्म है। यह अलग तरह की कहानी है, जो काफी मजेदार है। मैं खुश हूँ कि अब यह फिल्म दर्शकों के सामने आ रही है। इस फिल्म के बारे में यह भी बता दूँ कि इस फिल्म में क्राउड फंडिंग भी की गई है। प्रियांशी फिल्म्स (प्रियम श्रीवास्तव और हर्षिता करकरे) द्वारा निर्मित फिल्म में मल्लिका शेरावत, कुब्रा सैत, रणवीर शौरी, मनु ऋषि चड्ढा, चंद्रचूर राय, अभिजीत देशपांडे, अभिषेक शर्मा, ग्रेस गिरधर और वैशाली मल्हारा प्रमुख भूमिकाओं में हैं। एनफ्लिक्स प्राइवेट लिमिटेड (नितिन कुमार और सत्यवर्रत गौड) एक मिथ्या टॉकी और प्रियाशी फिल्म्स प्रोडक्शन द्वारा प्रस्तुत ‘RK/Rkay’ को रजत कपूर द्वारा लिखा और निर्देशित किया गया है। तो मैं, तो यही कहूँगी कि रजत ने आजतक काफी उम्दा काम किया है और वह इस फिल्म में भी कुछ नयापन जरूर लाएंगे, ऐसी मुझे उम्मीद है।"

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! मुझे यह भारतीय सिनेमा का बेस्ट फेज नजर आता है, वजह इसकी खास इसलिए है कि अब यहाँ भाषा को लेकर, फिल्मों में अभिनय करने के बारे में विचार नहीं किये जा रहे हैं, बल्कि हर कलाकार, हर भाषा में काम करना पसंद कर रहा है, ऐसे में मैं यहाँ तापसी पन्नू, सैयामी खेर और ऐसी कई अभिनेत्रियों के बारे में बताने जा रही हूँ, जो आने वाले समय में जम कर, कई भाषाओं में काम कर रही हैं। जहाँ तक बात आती है तापसी पन्नू की, तो तापसी ने हिंदी के साथ-साथ साउथ फिल्म इंडस्ट्री में भी एक बड़ा नाम बना लिया है। तापसी ने तो, वर्ष 2010 में तेलुगु फिल्म झुम्मंडी नादम के साथ अपनी शुरुआत के बाद से हिंदी और दक्षिणी सिनेमा दोनों में काम किया है – और उनके तमिल डेब्यू आदुकलम ने 58 वें राष्ट्रीय फिल्म पुरस्कारों में छह राष्ट्रीय फिल्म पुरस्कार जीते। तापसी का मानना है कि क्षेत्रीय सिनेमा जिस कारण से अब ध्यान आकर्षित कर रहा है, वह विभिन्न प्लेटफार्मों पर इसकी उपलब्धता है। कबीर खान की क्रिकेट ड्रामा, ’83’ में अपने छोटे, लेकिन प्रभावी प्रदर्शन के लिए जानी जाने वाली वामिका को हाल ही में नेटफ्लिक्स की ओरिजिनल क्राइम ड्रामा, ‘माई’ में साक्षी तंवर के साथ देखा गया था। इसके बाद उन्हें हाल ही में रिलीज़ एंथोलॉजी मॉडर्न लव मुंबई के विशाल भारद्वाज द्वारा निर्देशित मुंबई ड्रैगन में देखा गया था। वामिका पंजाबी, हिंदी, मलयालम, तमिल और तेलुगु फिल्मों में भी सक्रिय रूप से काम करती है। वामिका की लेटेस्ट पंजाबी फिल्म, ‘गलवाकड़ी’ ने क्षेत्रीय और राष्ट्रीय दोनों स्तरों पर बॉक्स ऑफिस पर बहुत अच्छा जादू किया था। अभिनेता ने आने वाले महीनों में और अधिक पंजाबी और तमिल फिल्में करने की योजना बनाई है, जिसमें ‘इरावाकालम’ और ‘किकली’ जैसे टाइटल पहले से ही वामिका के लिए ब्लॉक हैं, हम इस सच्चाई से वाकिफ हैं कि आगामी तिमाही उनके प्रशंसकों के लिए उनकी फिल्मों के ज़रिए एक सेलिब्रेशन होगा। कृति खरबंदा ने दक्षिण की फिल्मों के साथ अपने करियर की शुरुआत की और बाद में बॉलीवुड में कदम रखा। इससे पहले एक दर्जन से अधिक क्षेत्रीय फिल्में कीं। कृति का मानना है कि असली स्टारडम केवल दक्षिण में ही देखा जा सकता है, वैसे वह दोनों तरफ बैलेंस बना कर चल रही हैं और काफी फिल्में कर रही हैं। पूजा हेगड़े ने तमिल फिल्म मुगामुदी (2012) में अभिनय की शुरुआत की, उसके बाद ओका लैला कोसम में अपनी तेलुगु फिल्म की शुरुआत की , नागा चैतन्य अक्किनेनी के साथ और आशुतोष गोवारिकर की मोहनजोदाड़ो (2016 ) में ऋतिक रोशन के साथ हिंदी फिल्म की शुरुआत की। पूजा ने अक्षय कुमार की हाउसफुल 4 के साथ वापसी की और तब से उन्हें कोई रोक नहीं पाया है। तमिल और तेलुगु फिल्म उद्योगों में अपनी पहचान बनाने के बाद, पूजा लगातार हिंदी फिल्मों में नजर आने वाली हैं । रोहित शेट्टी की ‘सर्कस’ और साजिद नाडियाडवाला की ‘हाउसफुल 5 और कभी ईद कभी दीवाली में भी काम करने जा रही हैं। ‘एनटीआर: कथानायकुडु,’ ‘देव,’ ‘एनजीके,’ ‘मनमधुडु 2’ और अन्य जैसी फिल्मों के साथ क्षेत्रीय सिनेमा पर हावी होने के बाद, रकुल प्रीत ने ‘यारियां ‘ से हिंदी फिल्म की शुरुआत की। तमिल, तेलुगु, और कन्नड़ फिल्म में अपना नाम कमाने के बाद रकुल ने ‘अय्यारी,’ ‘दे दे प्यार दे,’ ‘सरदार का ग्रैंडसन,’ ‘अटैक,’ और अब ‘रनवे 34’ जैसी बैक-टू-बैक हिट फिल्मों के साथ बॉलीवुड में अपनी शुरुआत की। दिशा पटानी ने तेलुगु एक्शन फ्लिक ‘लोफर’ से फिल्मों में डेब्यू किया। उन्हें वरुण तेज के साथ जोड़ा गया था। फिल्म ने अच्छा प्रदर्शन किया और इसने अभिनेत्री को ‘एम.एस.धोनी द अनटोल्ड स्टोरी और भारत ‘ जैसी हिंदी फिल्मों में अभिनय करने का मौका भी दिया। ताज़ा खबर यह है कि दिशा पटानी भी प्रभास और दीपिका पादुकोण की ‘प्रोजेक्ट के ‘ के कलाकारों में शामिल हो गई हैं, जो नाग अश्विन द्वारा निर्देशित एक साइंस फिक्शन फिल्म है। सैयामी ने अपने अभिनय की शुरुआत तेलुगु फिल्म रे में साई धरम तेज के साथ की थी। बाद में उन्हें एक अन्य तेलुगु फिल्म वाइल्ड डॉग में देखा गया, जिसमें नागार्जुन अक्किनेनी, दीया मिर्जा, सैयामी खेर और अतुल कुलकर्णी सहित दक्षिण और बॉलीवुड दोनों अभिनेताओं का मिश्रण देखने को मिला है। सैयामी ने हिंदी सिनेमा में फिल्म मिर्जिया के साथ के डेब्यू किया जो राकेश ओमप्रकाश मेहरा की फिल्म थी। उन्होंने रितेश देशमुख के साथ मराठी फिल्म मौली में भी काम किया जो काफी सफल रही। सैयामी अब एक और तेलुगु फिल्म का हिस्सा बनने जा रही हैं। सैयामी की हिंदी सिनेमा के साथ-साथ घूमर, फाड़ू ब्रीद इनटू द शैडोज़ सीजन 2 में भी प्रभावशाली लाइन-अप है। रश्मिका अपनी हिंदी फिल्मों में आने से पहले ही हिंदी सिनेमा में बेहद पॉपुलर हो गयी है। बॉलीवुड में उनकी आने वाली फिल्मों सिद्धार्थ मल्होत्रा के साथ मिशन मजनू और अमिताभ बच्चन के साथ गुडबाय है। उन्हें बॉलीवुड में एक ऐसी अभिनेत्री के रूप में देखा जा रहा है जिनके काम की सराहना की जा सकती है। रश्मिका , दक्षिण की एक जानी-मानी अभिनेत्री हैं, जो मुख्य रूप से कन्नड़, तेलुगु और तमिल सिनेमा में काम करती रही हैं। उनकी हाल ही में रिलीज़ हुई तेलुगु फिल्म पुष्पा: द राइज़ ने पहले ही बेहद वायरल गीत श्रीवल्ली से उन्हें सबसे अधिक लोकप्रियता मिली है। वाकई, इन अभिनेत्रियों की हर भाषा में बनने वाली सफलता को देख कर, यही कह सकती हूँ कि सिनेमा को किसी भी भाषा की सीमा में बाँधना सही नहीं है, क्योंकि हमें एक से बढ़ कर एक टैलेंट को देखने को मिलता है इन अभिनेत्रियों की तरह ही।"

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! सच कहूँ, तो मेरी भी चाहत है कि मैं दिल्ली से लद्दाख तक की एक रोड ट्रिप करूँ और वह भी गर्ल गैंग के साथ, मगर फिलहाल यह फैंटेसी वाली ही बात नजर आ रही है, लेकिन एक ट्रिप जिस पर रत्ना पाठक शाह, दीया मिर्जा , संजना संघी और फातिमा सना शेख निकले हैं, वह फ़िल्मी तो है, लेकिन किसी तूफ़ान से कम नजर नहीं आ रहा है, जी हाँ, मैं बात कर रही हूँ फिल्म धक धक की, जो एक रोड ट्रिप पर फिल्म है और फिलहाल फिल्म की शूटिंग इन दिनों बेहद दिलचस्प अंदाज में पूरी की जा रही है। जी हाँ, फिल्म की पूरी कास्ट और क्रू ने दिल्ली से खारदुंगला तक शूटिंग के लिए राइड किया। यह पहली बार है, जब भारतीय सिनेमा में किसी फिल्म क्रू, पूरी टीम के साथ भारत के सबसे ऊँचे मोटोरेबल पास में सीन शूट करने पहुंचे। 48 डिग्री तापमान से सीधे -2 डिग्री तापमान पर आना, किसी तूफानी रोमांच से कम नहीं था, मेरे तो बस सोच लेने भर से गूजबंप्स आ रहे हैं। टीम ने लद्दाख के कठिन मौसम की परिस्थिति में भी शूटिंग पूरी की है। दीया मिर्जा इस फिल्म को लेकर उत्साहित हैं वह कहती हैं एक आर्टिस्ट के रूप में मेरे लिए यह काफी मेमोरेबल मोमेंट रहेगा, यह फिल्म खारदुंगला पास में शूट की जा रही है, जिसकी अपनी एक खासियत रही है और हम सभी ने उसे महसूस किया है। मैं अपने निर्माता को इस बात के लिए बधाई देना चाहूंगी कि उन्होंने ऐसी कोई परिकल्पना की। खासतौर से इंडियन आर्मी के लिए भी, जिन्होंने हमारे लिए इस अनुभव को खास बनाया। फातिमा तो सबसे ज्यादा खुश हैं वह कहती हैं मुझे इस फिल्म को करने में काफी मजा आ रहा है, क्योंकि मुझे राइड्स में मजा आता है, इस सफर में जिस तरह से चुनौतियों को पार करना है, एक एक्टर के लिए यह अद्भुत है, खारदुंगला तक पहुँचने में हमने काफी कुछ उतार चढ़ाव महसूस किया, लेकिन फिर भी काफी मजा आया। रत्ना कहती हैं इस ट्रिप में मैंने मेरे डर को दूर भगाया है वह कहती हैं अगर मुझसे छह महीने पहले किसी ने कहा होता कि आपको लद्दाख जाना है, वह भी बाइक चला कर, तो मैं इस बात पर सिर्फ हंसती, लेकिन इस फिल्म ने मुझे मेरे डर से लड़ने की क्षमता दी, मुझे यह भी महसूस कराया कि कठिन परिस्थिति में खुद को कैसे निकालें या सामना करें। मेरे लिए यह सफर हमेशा खास रहेगा। संजना भी इसे अपने करियर का बेस्ट मोमेंट मान रही हैं वह कहती हैं जिंदगी में ऐसे कुछ मोमेंट्स होते हैं, जो रियल नहीं लगते हैं, मेरे लिए यह मोमेंट्स ऐसे ही कुछ खास हैं। इस फिल्म के लिए रोड ट्रिप करना एक अलग ही अनुभव है। यह मेरे लिए चैलेंजिंग भी है और अपने कम्फर्ट जोन से बाहर आकर कुछ करना भी। तो मैं तो इसे अपना लाइफ टाइम अनुभव मान रही हूँ। बता दूँ कि धक धक अगले साल रिलीज होने वाली है, फिल्म का निर्देशन तरुण डूडेजा ने किया है और फिल्म का निर्माण वायकॉम 18 स्टूडियोज और आउटसाइडर फिल्म्स प्रोडक्शन और बीएलएम पिक्चर्स ने किया है। वैसे, सच कहूँ तो इन चारों अभिनेत्रियों का रोमांच देख कर, मुझे तो यह फिल्म जल्द से जल्द देखने की चाहत हो रही है।"

Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! आने वाले महीनों में मैं सच बोलूं, तो अपने कैलेंडर को मार्क करने का समय आ गया है, क्योंकि एक से बढ़ कर एक फिल्म सामने आ रही हैं और ऐसे में मैं तो किसी भी फिल्म को मिस करने का रिस्क नहीं उठा सकती हूँ, जैसे अब कटरीना कैफ, ईशान खट्टर और सिद्धांत चतुर्वेदी की फिल्म फोन भूत की भी रिलीज तारीख की घोषणा हो गई है। फिल्म 7 अक्टूबर2022 को रिलीज होगी और मैं इस फिल्म को देखने के लिए अभी से उत्साहित हूँ। टीजर देख कर, जो मैं अनुमान लगा रही हूँ कि यह फिल्म हॉरर कॉमेडी जोन में एक नया रूप लेने वाली है और काफी एक्सपेरिमेंटल साबित होगी। साथ ही कटरीना को इससे पहले ऐसे किरदार में नहीं देखा है, तो वह देखना भी पूरी तरह से दिलचस्प ही होगा। जबसे सूर्यवंशी रिलीज हुई, उसके बाद से कटरीना कैफ की कोई नयी फिल्म सामने नहीं आई है, ऐसे में इस फिल्म में जैसा पोस्टर नजर आ रहा है, मैं तो पूरी उम्मीद कर रही हूँ कि इसमें उनका किरदार दमदार होने वाला है और वह सिद्धांत चतुर्वेदी और ईशान खट्टर , यानी दोनों ही बॉयज को कड़ी टक्कर देने वाली हैं, मुझे तो इस फिल्म में महिला किरदार काफी स्ट्रांग नजर आ रहा है। ऐसे में मुझे यह भी उम्मीद है कि रितेश सिधवानी और फरहान अख्तर की एक्सेल एंटरटेनमेंट की अपकमिंग एडवेंचर कॉमेडी फोन भूत एक हॉरर ट्विस्ट के साथ पेश की जाएगी। गुरमीत सिंह द्वारा निर्देशित और रवि शंकरन और जसविंदर सिंह बाथ द्वारा लिखी गई ये कहानी में काफी ट्विस्ट होंगे, ऐसा मुझे लग रहा है।"

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! मैंने, जब पहली बार आर माधवन की फिल्म रॉकेट्री द नंबी इफेक्ट का ट्रेलर देखा था, उस वक़्त से मुझे यही महसूस हुआ कि अगर किसी इंसान पर कोई फिल्मकार यह ब्यौरा उठाता है कि उन्हें बायोपिक फिल्म बनानी है, तो इतनी ही शिद्दत और ईमानदारी दिखाएं, जैसी आर माधवन ने दिखाई है, जिन्होंने इस फिल्म को एक ऑथेंटिक बनाने में कोई कसर नहीं छोड़ी है, शारीरिक मेहनत से लेकर फैक्ट्स के साथ, उन्होंने इस फिल्म में वह सबकुछ देने की कोशिश की है, जो एक बायोपिक फिल्म में होनी चाहिए। ऐसे में आर माधवन ने इस फिल्म को लेकर उनकी जो जर्नी रही है, उस पर विस्तार से बातचीत की है, साथ ही कुछ और पहलुओं पर भी अपनी बात रखी है। आर माधवन की इस फिल्म की कहानी साइंटिस्ट और एयरोस्पेस इंजीनियर नम्बी नारायणन की जिंदगी पर आधारित है। आर माधवन ने आमतौर पर बनने वाली बायोपिक फिल्मों से अलग इस फिल्म में बहुत मेहनत की है। वह 18 घंटे तक एक ही कुर्सी पर बैठे रहे हैं, तो अपना वजन बढ़ाने से लेकर दांत तुड़वाने तक भी बहुत कुछ किया है। उन्होंने इस वीडियो में भी इस बारे में बात कही है। इस बारे में वह विस्तार से बताते हैं मेरा लुक नेचुरल है और फिल्म में मेरा लुक बिना किसी प्रोस्थेटिक्स के बनाया गया है! मैंने इस लुक को जीवंत करने के लिए 18 घंटे कुर्सी पर बिताए। चाहे उनके बाल हों, दांत हों या वजन, मैंने कोशिश की है कि मैं जितना परफेक्शन दे पाऊं। मैं बस इसे रॉ रखना चाहता था। दरअसल, मैंने अपने दांत भी तुड़वाये हैं और बहुत ज्यादा वजन भी बढ़ाया है। इस फिल्म के आइडिया की बात करूँ तो मैं विक्रम विधा करने के बाद, कोई यशराज टाइप की फिल्म करने के मूड में था। मेरे एक मित्र ने मुझे बताया कि यह इसरो वैज्ञानिक कहानी है जो बहुत सुंदर थी और उसे मालदीव की एक महिला से प्यार हो गया। बाद में कहा गया कि उसने पाकिस्तान को रॉकेट सीक्रेट्स बेच दिए। बाद में उन्हें पकड़ लिया गया और जेल में डाल दिया गया और उन्हें प्रताड़ित किया गया, पूछताछ की गई और लगभग मार डाला गया। वह जेल से बाहर आने में कामयाब रहा और सीबीआई के पास गया और साबित किया कि वह निर्दोष था और सभी दावे झूठ थे। मैंने कहा कि यह एक अच्छे गरीब आदमी की जेम्स बॉन्ड जैसी कहानी है, जिसमें एक अच्छे दिखने वाले इसरो वैज्ञानिक को मालदीव की एक महिला से प्यार हो गया है। हम जेम्स बॉन्ड जैसी अच्छी और छोटी फिल्म बना सकते हैं। इसी इरादे से मैं नंबी नारायणन से मिलने त्रिवेंद्रम चला गया। उस दिन से लेकर आज तक आप एक बदले हुए माधवन को देखेंगे। उनके चेहरे की चमक और उनके बात करने के तरीके से मुझे एहसास हुआ कि हम कुछ बहुत अच्छा याद कर रहे थे। इस आदमी को सिर्फ इस मामले के लिए नहीं जाना जा सकता है। दुर्भाग्य से लोग उसके बारे में ज्यादा नहीं जानते थे। और मैं इस कहानी को बनाने में लग गया। आर माधवन के बेटे वेदांत माधवन ने देश का मान बढ़ाया है, माधवन ने उनके बारे में बात करते हुए दिलचस्प बातें कही। बेटे वेदांत माधवन ने हाल ही में डेनिश ओपन में पुरुषों की 800 मीटर फ्रीस्टाइल स्पर्धा में अलेक्जेंडर एल ब्योर्न को उनके घर में 0.10 सेकेंड के अंतर से हराकर गोल्‍ड जीता. आर माधवन इस बारे में कहते हैं वेदांत में वह डेडिकेशन रहा है, वह हर दिन लगभग आठ सालों तक चार बजे उठ जाता था, ऐसे में मुझे खुद लगा कि उसका अगर इस तरफ इंट्रेस्ट है, तो उसको बढ़ावा देना चाहिए। ऐसे में उसने स्विमिंग को गंभीरता से लिया और आज ये मुकाम हासिल किया। मैं उससे जब भी एक्टर बनने की बात करता हूँ, तो वह मुझे कहता है स्विमिंग पर फोकस करने दो पापा। वैसे मैंने उसे यह भी समझाया है कि शोहरत और सफलता में क्या अंतर होता है। आपने अभी ओलंपिक्स नहीं जीता है। हो सकता है कि कॉमन वेल्थ में जाकर आपको ब्रॉन्ज ही मिले, लेकिन मैंने उसे समझाया है कि इसमें कन्फ्यूज नहीं होना है। लोकप्रियता काफी सीमित समय के लिए होती है, इसलिए इसको दिमाग पर नहीं चढ़ाना है। अपनी स्विमिंग पर और अधिक ध्यान देना है। लेकिन उसने जिस तरह से जीत हासिल की है, एक पिता होने के नाते बहुत गर्व होता है। आर माधवन कहते हैं कि शाह रुख ने जब उनसे जीरो के सेट पर इस फिल्म का हिस्सा बनने की बात कही थी, उस वक़्त उन्हें यह बात मजाक लगी थी। वह विस्तार से बताते हैं मैंने जब जीरो फिल्म की शूटिंग के दौरान उनके जन्मदिन पर विश किया, उन्होंने कहा कि वह इस फिल्म में कुछ करना चाहते हैं। मैंने उन्हें थैंक यू कहा। उन्होंने कहा कि मैं इस बारे में सीरियस हूँ। फिर मैं वहां से चला गया। दो दिन बाद, मेरी पत्नी ने मुझसे कहा कि कम से कम थैंक यू तो कह दो शाह रुख को, उन्होंने ऐसे हौसला अफजाई की। मैंने उनकी मैनेजर को मेसेज किया और कहा कि अच्छा लगा कि शाह रुख ने ऐसा कहा। फिर शाह रुख की मैनजर ने फोन किया और कहा कि वह वाकई में फिल्म का हिस्सा बनना चाहते हैं। मैंने उनसे कहा आप मुझे सिर्फ दिलासा दे रहे हैं, यह मेरी पहली निर्देशित फिल्म है। उनकी मैनेजर ने कहा कि आप डेट्स बताओ, वह आ जायेंगे। फिर जिस दिन वह नम्बी नारायण से मिले, उनकी आँखों में मैंने उनके लिए जो सम्मान देखा, मुझे समझ आया कि वह फिल्म का हिस्सा क्यों बनना चाहते थे। वाकई, जिस तरह से आर माधवन ने इस फिल्म पर मेहनत की है, मैं तो दिल से चाहूंगी कि ऐसी कहानियों को प्रोत्साहन मिलना चाहिए ,ऐसे में फिल्म 1 जुलाई 2022 को रिलीज होने जा रही है और मैंने तो फिल्म फर्स्ट डे फर्स्ट शो देखने की योजना बना ली है।"

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! इन दिनों, अगर युवा अभिनेत्रियों की बात की जाए, तो सबसे ज्यादा चर्चा हो रही है कियारा आडवाणी की। मैं इसकी कई वजह देख पा रही हूँ। एक तो कियारा आडवाणी अपनी फिल्मों के विषयों के जिस तरह से चुनाव कर रही हैं, वह दर्शकों के दिलों को छू रहे हैं, इसके अलावा सोशल मीडिया पर भी कियारा, किसी विवादों का हिस्सा नहीं बनती हैं, वह बिंदास अंदाज में नजर आती हैं, मैं तो पिछले आठ सालों से उनसे लगातार मिल रही हूँ, उनकी पहली फिल्म से लेकर अब कामयाबी हासिल करने के बावजूद वह काफी विनम्र हैं और डाउन टू अर्थ हैं, शायद ऐसी और भी खासियत है उनकी, जो उन्हें अन्य अभिनेत्रियों की तुलना में अलग बना रहा है। उनकी फिल्में हाल ही में रिलीज हुई हैं, जिनमें भूल भुलैया 2 और जुग जुग जियो प्रमुख हैं और दोनों ही कामयाब रही हैं। सो, मैंने यहाँ कियारा के आठ साल के करियर में उनकी रील लाइफ और रियल लाइफ की वे पांच बातें शामिल की हैं, जो मेरी नजर में कियारा को पूरी तरह अलहदा बनाता है। कियारा से मिलने पर जो मैं हर बार महसूस करती हूँ, वह इस बात को कभी नहीं भूलती हैं कि इस इंडस्ट्री में उनकी शुरुआत कितनी कठिन रही थी। वह हमेशा याद करती हैं कि किस तरह फगली के बाद, उनके पास कोई ऑफर नहीं आये थे। फिर एमएस धोनी काफी समय बाद मिली, लेकिन कबीर सिंह उनके करियर की टर्निंग पॉइंट रहीं। कियारा को मैंने कभी किसी भी जर्नलिस्ट के सवाल को नकारते हुए या टालने जैसे जवाब देते नहीं देखा है। वह हर सवाल पर विस्तार से जवाब देती हैं, सीनियर जर्नलिस्ट का भी काफी सम्मान करती हैं। और यही बात उन्हें अन्य कलाकारों से अलग बना रही है। कियारा के किरदारों पर जब मैं गौर करती हूँ, तो यह भी महसूस करती हूँ कि उन्हें जब ट्रेडिशनल अवतार में उनके डिजाइनर सजाते हैं, तब भी उनका रूप निखर कर सामने आता है। वह अपने किरदारों में ग्लैमरस अंदाज भी ले आती हैं। कियारा के साथ, जो मैं महसूस कर पा रही हूँ कि निर्देशक हर तरह के एक्सपेरिमेंट्स कर सकते हैं। वह पारिवारिक किरदारों के साथ-साथ गर्ल नेक्स्ट डोर में भी फिट बैठ रही हैं और शायद यही वजह है कि वह निर्देशकों की पहली पसंद बन भी चुकी हैं। कियारा ने कबीर सिंह ने जिस तरह से एक प्रेमिका का किरदार निभाया है और जिस तरह से वह स्क्रीन पर रोती हैं, उन्हें देख कर, दर्शक भी रोने पर मजबूर हो जाते हैं, वह जिस कन्विक्शन के साथ ऐसे सीन्स को निभा जाती हैं। विद्या बालन, शेफाली शाह, साक्षी तंवर के बाद, मुझे किसी का स्क्रीन पर रोना एकदम वास्तविक लगता है और दिल को छू जाता है, तो वह कियारा ही हैं। हाल ही में रिलीज हुई उनकी फिल्म जुग जुग जियो में उनके और नीतू कपूर के बीच जो एक दृश्य है, जिसमें दोनों सास-बहू काफी इमोशनल हैं, कियारा ने इसे बेहद सार्थक रूप से निभाया है। कियारा के आस-पास होने पर मैंने उनकी पॉजिटिविटी महसूस की है, उन्हें मैंने कभी भी हड़बड़ी या किसी तरह की शिकायत या कॉम्पटीशन करते हुए नहीं देखा है, ऐसा लग रहा है कि वह बेहद इत्मीनान से, बस अपना काम करती जा रही हैं, क्योंकि वह जानती हैं कि अंतत : काम ही बोलता है, स्क्रीन पर उनका चुलबुला अंदाज, दरअसल, रियल लाइफ रूप ही है कियारा का, जिससे मेरी जैसी कई सिने प्रेमी कनेक्ट करती हैं। अभी कुछ दिन पहले, मैं मेरे घर के एक बुजुर्ग से बातचीत कर रही थी, उन्होंने मुझसे कियारा के स्वभाव के बारे में जानना चाहा, वह कहते हैं कि जुग जुग जियो उन्होंने देखी और उन्हें लगता है कि कियारा जैसी बहू और बेटी दोनों ही हो सकती है एक घर में, उन्होंने कियारा के किरदार से कनेक्ट किया। फिर मेरे घर के बच्चे, कियारा को भूल भुलैया 2 की रीत से कनेक्ट कर रहे, तो युवाओं में कियारा का क्रश वाली फैन फॉलोइंग है, इससे मैं समझ पा रही हूँ कि कियारा को हर दर्शक वर्ग पसंद कर रहे हैं। सच कहूं, तो यह कियारा की सादगी है, जिसने दर्शकों का दिल जीता है। कियारा, आप ऐसी ही बनी रहना और आने वाले समय में और भी फिल्में आपके कदम चूमे। कबीर सिंह, शेरशाह, भूल भुलैया 2 और अब जुग जुग जियो, इसी तरह एक के बाद, एक फिल्में कामयाब रहें, बॉक्स ऑफिस की आप शेरशाह बनें और ऐसी ही जुग जुग जीती रहें, मैं तो यही चाहूंगी।"

Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! इन दिनों, फिल्म मेकर्स के लिए बेहतरीन दौर है, ऐसा मैं मानती हूँ, क्योंकि एक के बाद अच्छे मेकर्स को मौके मिल रहे हैं, ऐसे में मशहूर निर्माता सिद्धार्थ रॉय कपूर ने भी एक नयी घोषणा की है कि रॉय कपूर फिल्म्स ने 8 प्रतिभाशाली निर्देशकों को नए मौके देने की बात की है। खास बात यह है कि इन निर्देशकों में झुण्ड, सैराट जैसी फिल्में बना चुके नागराज मंजुले और शेरशाह जैसी फिल्म बना चुके विष्णुवर्धन जैसे दिग्गज निर्देशकों का नाम शामिल है। जी हाँ, नेटफ्लिक्स पर आरण्यक और सोनी लिव पर रॉकेट बॉयज़ की सफलता के बाद, सिद्धार्थ रॉय कपूर के प्रोडक्शन हाउस, रॉय कपूर फिल्म्स (आरकेएफ) ने 2022/23 में एक प्रभावशाली निर्देशकों को अपने साथ जोड़ने की घोषणा की है। लगभग 8 निर्देशक, रॉय कपूर फिल्म्स के लिए ऐतिहासिक महाकाव्यों से लेकर पारिवारिक ड्रामा तक बनाएंगे। एक नयी सीरीज के रूप में यह 8 निर्देशक अपनी कहानी लेकर आएंगे। यहाँ दिलचस्प बात यह भी है कि साल 2021 की सबसे बड़ी हिट फिल्म शेरशाह के डायरेक्टर विष्णुवर्धन अब आरकेएफ के साथ जुड़ गए हैं । वह पहली बार बड़े पैमाने पर एक्शन ड्रामा वेब सीरीज का निर्देशन करेंगे, जो भारत के 20 वीं सदी के सैनीय इतिहास के एक अंग की आकर्षक कहानी दर्शाती है। वहीं, महेश नारायणन , मलयालम सिनेमा के सबसे प्रतिभाशाली युवा निर्देशकों में से एक, जिन्होंने भारत की पहली “स्क्रीन-लाइफ” फिल्म सी यू सून और राजनैतिक थ्रिलर मलिक के साथ एक ऐतिहासिक कामयाबी बटोरी हैं, अब जासूसी पर आधारित मल्टी-सीजन वेब शो का निर्देशन करेंगे । मध्य पूर्व और दक्षिण एशिया में शूट के लिए तैयार हैं। वहीं, हार्दिक मेहता, राष्ट्रीय पुरस्कार विजेता निर्देशक और हिट नेटफ्लिक्स शो डीकपल्ड के बाद उन्हें कामयाबी के लिए खूब सारी प्रशंसा मिली है। अब यह टैलेंटेड डायरेक्टर यूरोप, अफ्रीका और भारत में युद्धरत व्यापारिक परिवारों की दुर्लभ तथा रोमांचक पारिवारिक ड्रामा सीरीज़ के लिए तैयार हैं। मेरे बेहद प्रिय निर्देशकों में से एक रहे, मकबूल और मैं हूं ना के लेखक अब्बास टायरवाला , जिनकी निर्देशन में पहली फिल्म जाने तू या जाने ना एक कल्ट यूथ क्लासिक फिल्म मानी जाती है, दक्षिण एशिया में सेट एक स्टाइलिश जासूसी एक्शन ड्रामा सीरीज़ लिखेंगे और निर्देशन की भागदौड़ संभालेंगे। वहीं नागराज मंजुले भी इससे जुड़े हैं। मटका किंग , जिसे पिछले साल घोषित किया गया था, सैराट के प्रतिष्ठित निर्देशक नागराज मंजुले द्वारा बनाया जाएगा, और यह जुआ खेल “मटका ” की आकर्षक दुनिया और इसे चलाने वाले खतरनाक और प्रतिभाशाली पुरुषों पर आधारित है। महिला फिल्मकारों की बात करूँ तो, बाफ्टा ब्रेकथ्रू अवार्ड्स 2022 के विजेताओं में से एक, आरती कदव , जिनकी पहली फीचर फिल्म कार्गो की भारतीय “ लो-फाई” साई-फाई स्पेस में है, एक ऐसी सीरीज का निर्माण कर रही है जो साय-फाय जॉनर में एक फ्रेश और क्वर्की रोमांटिक कहानी होगी। मेरा मानना है कि आरकेएफ के प्रयासों में से एक नई आवाजों को कहानी कहने के लिए और अपने नए दृष्टिकोण को प्रदर्शित करने के लिए एक मंच प्रदान करके उन्हें सशक्त बनाते है, ऐसे में वह स्थापित नामों के साथ-साथ, नए निर्देशकों के साथ भी प्लानिंग कर रहे हैं। ऐसे में लोकप्रिय एड गुरु भावेश कपाड़िया , जो अपने अनोखे और लोकप्रिय टीवी विज्ञापनों से टीवी पर धूम मचा दी, वह एक जंगली और मनोरंजक महिला-प्रधान कॉमिक थ्रिलर सीरीज के साथ अपने निर्देशन की शुरुआत करेंगे। वहीं यह जानना अभी दिलचस्प है कि इस साल के अंत में, रॉय कपूर फिल्म्स फीचर फिल्में पिप्पा, वो लड़की है कहां और बस करो आंटी रिलीज करेंगे। साथ ही रॉकेट बॉयज़ का बहुप्रतीक्षित सीज़न 2 भी जल्द रिलीज होने को तैयार है। मेरा तो मानना है कि आने वाला साल आरकेएफ का ही होने वाला है। मुझे तो इन सारी सीरीज और फिल्मों का बेसब्री से इंतजार रहेगा।"

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! किसी शख्सियत पर एक ऑथेंटिक बायोपिक, बिना महिमामंडन किये हुए कैसे बना सकते हैं, मैं तो यह हुनर आर माधवन से सीखना चाहूंगी, जिन्होंने अपनी पहली ही निर्देशित फिल्म रॉकेट्री -द नंबी इफेक्ट , जो निर्देशन के लिहाज से इफेक्ट छोड़ा है, इस फिल्म को देखने के बाद, मैं इमोशनल भी हूँ और गुस्से में भी हूँ और शर्मिंदा भी हूँ। गुस्सा और शर्मिंदा इसलिए कि हमारे देश में ऐसे कई लोग हैं, जो अपनी देशभक्ति को साबित करने के लिए नारे नहीं लगाते हैं, शोर नहीं मचाते हैं, बल्कि बस काम करते जाते हैं। महान साइंटिस्ट नंबी नारायणन ने भी तो वही किया था, लेकिन उन्हें बदले में देश द्रोह का झूठा इल्जाम और बेइज्जती मिली और यह सब किसने किया, हमने ही। आर माधवन की इस बात के लिए सराहना होनी चाहिए कि फिल्म बना कर, उन्होंने नम्बी नारायणन के योगदान से हमें अवगत तो कराया ही, साथ ही इसके माध्यम से कुछ हद तक, उस शख्सियत जो बहुत कुछ डिज़र्व करते थे, लेकिन उन्हें मिला तो सिर्फ दुःख, उनके लिए यह पूरे भारत की तरफ से एक माफीनामा है। शाह रुख खान ने फिल्म से जुड़ कर और जिस तरह से इमोशनल होकर, इस फिल्म को सपोर्ट किया है, मैं उनकी भी सराहना करना चाहूंगी। फिल्म हर भारतीय को क्यों देखनी चाहिए, मैं आगे विस्तार से बता रही हूँ। नम्बी नारायणन ( आर माधवन) एक जीनियस साइंटिस्ट हैं, वह शुरू से ही फैक्ट्स के साथ चलते हैं, लेकिन अपने अनुभव के आधार पर, उन्होंने कभी किताबी ज्ञान पर ध्यान नहीं दिया। अगर कभी किताब में भी कमियां हैं, तो वह राइटर को उनकी गलती गिनाने में पीछे नहीं रहते हैं। वह ISRO में काम करते हैं और भारत को विज्ञान के आधार पर विश्व में पहचान दिलाने में जुटे हुए हैं। वह नासा जैसी विश्व की सबसे बड़े विज्ञान संस्थान की भी नौकरी ठुकराने में नहीं हिचकते हैं, क्योंकि उन्हें अपने देश से प्यार है, वह एक अलग मिशन पर निकलते हैं, इसमें उन्हें विक्रम साराभाई, जिन्हें वह अपने पिता समान मानते हैं, उनका पूरा सहयोग मिलता है, अब्दुल कलाम का साथ मिलता है। नम्बी नारायणन ने न सिर्फ विश्व की बड़े संस्थानों से ज्ञान लिया, बल्कि बड़े साइंटिस्ट के साथ अपने थीसिस भी पूरा किया। नम्बी एक विजनरी रहे हैं और ऐसे में उनकी बस यही चाहत थी कि वह अपने देश भारत के लिए कुछ करें, लेकिन एक बेबुनियादी इल्जाम ने उन्हें देश द्रोह बना दिया कि उन्होंने एक मालदीव की महिला के साथ नाजायज संबंध बना कर, उन्हें भारत के रॉकेट के सीक्रेट्स, पाकिस्तान को बेच दिए हैं। आर माधवन ने फिल्म को दो भागों में बांटा है, एक में नम्बी नारायणन के साइंटिस्ट बनने के बाद, किस तरह से रशिया से उपकरण लाने में उन्होंने एड़ी-चोटी एक कर दी थी, उसका ब्योरा है, दूसरे हिस्से में नम्बी नारायणन की जिंदगी का खौफनाक झूठ, जिसने उनकी जिंदगी बर्बाद कर दी, उनके परिवार की जिंदगी बर्बाद कर दी, उन पर देश द्रोह का लम्बा केस चला। माधवन ने तर्क के साथ, एक ऐसे निडर इंसान की कहानी कही है, जो अपने सच से पीछे नहीं हटा, उन्होंने लड़ाई लड़ी, लेकिन ऐसे में उन्होंने क्या-क्या खोया, उसे एक इमोशनल जर्नी के माध्यम से दर्शकों तक पहुंचाने की कोशिश की है, ऐसे में मैं तो कहानी से पूरी तरह से कनेक्ट कर गई। मैंने इस फिल्म में एक इमोशनल कनेक्ट तो महसूस किया ही, साथ ही मुझे ख़ुशी है कि माधवन ने इसे हद से ज्यादा ड्रामेटिक नहीं बनाया है। उनका ध्यान कहानी से नहीं भटका नहीं है। वह अपने किरदारों को मैलोड्रामैटिक नहीं बनाते हैं। बेवजह की भाषणबाजी नहीं है। शाह रुख खान एक शो के होस्ट हैं और फिर वह नम्बी से पूरी बातचीत करते हैं, यह डॉक्यू फीचर अंदाज में दर्शकों तक पहुंचाते हैं, यह अंदाज भी मुझे एकदम प्रासंगिक नजर आया। किसी शख्स की तारीफ़ करने में निर्देशक ने, उसके नेगेटिव पहलुओं को भी दर्शाने की कोशिश की है, यह बात कहानी को और खास बनाती है। मुझे ऐसा लगता है कि फिल्म के पहले हिस्से में कहानी में बहुत कट टू कट दिखाया है, तो जो साइंस से सम्बन्ध नहीं रखते हैं, उन्हें कई बार फिल्म में कन्फ्यूजन भी होगा। मैंने हाल ही में जब माधवन से पूछा था कि क्या यह फिल्म आपके लिए मुगल ए आजम है, उन्होंने कहा था कि हाँ, शायद, यह फिल्म देखने के बाद, मैं यह बात समझ पाई हूँ कि माधवन ने इस फिल्म में कितना एफर्ट लगाया है और इसे अपना बेस्ट देने में कोई कसर एक एक्टर के रूप में या निर्देशक के रूप में नहीं छोड़ा है। इसलिए, मेरे लिए यह माधवन की यादगार फिल्मों में से एक बन जाती है। उन्होंने लहजे से लेकर, परफेक्शन देने में कोई भी कसर नहीं छोड़ी है। सच कहूँ, तो ऐसी फिल्मों का बनना और आर माधवन जैसे मेगा स्टार को इसे सामने लाना बेहद जरूरी है, ताकि ऐसी शख्सियत की कहानियां सामने आ सकें और उन्हें कम से कम कुछ हद तक दर्शक देख और समझ पाएं। फिल्म 1 जुलाई 2022 को रिलीज हो रही है, एक सच्चे देशभक्त के लिए यह फिल्म समर्पित है।"

Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! मुझे रियल लाइफ में भी विद्युत जामवाल असली नायक लगते हैं। जी हाँ, मैं उन्हें इसलिए भी बेहद एडमायर करती हूँ कि वह बिना शोर-शराबे के कई नेक काम किये जा रहे हैं। वह रेप विक्टिम महिलाओं के लिए काफी समय से काम कर रहे हैं, इन सबके अलावा वह मार्शल आर्ट्स की दुनिया में भी शीर्ष पर हैं, तो फिल्मों में भी वह अपने तरह का एक्शन करने में पीछे नहीं रहे हैं। ऐसे में जल्द ही उनकी फिल्म खुदा हाफिज चैप्टर 2 रिलीज होने जा रही है। उन्होंने मुझसे इस बातचीत में खुद से जुड़े कुछ दिलचस्प पहलू शेयर किये हैं, उसके अंश मैं यहाँ शेयर कर रही हूँ। विद्युत ने अपनी फिल्म खुदा हाफिज 2 के बारे कहा है कि वह इस बार अपने बच्चे के लिए लड़ते हुए दिखाई देंगे वह विस्तार से बताते हैं मुझे इस फिल्म को करने के बाद, यह महसूस हुआ कि एक माता-पिता के लिए दुनिया में उनके बच्चे से बढ़ कर कुछ नहीं होता है और क्यों नहीं होता है, मेरे माता-पिता की फीलिंग्स को भी मैं समझ पाया। मैं उस बात को समझ पाया हूँ। विद्युत कहते हैं कि वह एक बेटी के पिता बनना चाहते हैं वह कहते हैं मैं चाहता हूँ कि मेरी बेटी हो और मैं उसे पूरी फ्रीडम देकर रखूं। सच कहूँ, तो हिंदुस्तान में अब यह सब कहना कि भाई को लेके जाना, रात में जाना, ये सब अब बंद करना होगा, हमें हमारी महिलाओं को फ्रीडम देना होगा और ये तब्दीली तो मैं खुद ही कर दूंगा, पक्का है, क्योंकि मैं कहूंगा कि मैं हूँ न। मुझे ऐसा लगता है कि अगर मैं लड़के का पिता बना, तो उनको भी समझाऊंगा कि एक महिला को किस तरह से रिस्पेक्ट देनी चाहिए। हम हर बार सोचते हैं, लेकिन करते नहीं हैं, मैं मेरे बेटे को सिखाऊंगा कि अगर किसी लड़की को मदद की जरूरत है, तो उसके साथ जाकर खड़े हो जा, उसकी मदद कर। विद्युत का मानना है कि सरकार को नहीं हमें कदम उठाना होगा वह कहते हैं समाज में जो यह परेशानी है, गर्ल चाइल्ड को लेकर जो लगातार घटनाएं हो रही हैं, ऐसा हमेशा से होता आया है, लेकिन हाँ अब खबरें सामने आने लगी हैं। मैं इस बारे में यही कहना चाहूंगा कि किसी भी देश की सरकार इसमें कुछ नहीं कर सकती है, समाज को समाज ही चेंज कर सकती है। मेरा पर्सनल अनुभव की बात करूँ, तो अगर आप अपने इर्द-गिर्द महिलाएं हों, तो आप अधिक विनम्र हो जाते हैं। विद्युत् साफ़ कहते हैं कि उनका खुद से कॉम्पटीशन हैं , वह जानते हैं कि वह बेस्ट हैं, तो वह किसी कन्टेम्पररी से क्यों करेंगे तुलना या प्रतिस्पर्धा क्यों करेंगे। इसलिए मैं इन बातों में यकीन नहीं करता हूँ, जहाँ तक बात है लक की तो मैं लक में यकीन करता हूँ, लेकिन मेहनत में भी यकीन करता हूँ, क्योंकि बिना मेहनत के लक लेकर कुछ नहीं होगा। विद्युत ने हाल ही में नंदिता महतानी से सगाई की है, वह उनके बारे में भी कहते हैं कि वह टिपिकल गर्ल फ्रेंड बिल्कुल नहीं है, वह हर समय फोन करके डिस्टर्ब नहीं करती है, मुझे मेरे काम पर फोकस करने देती है, वह मेरी जिंदगी में बेहद महत्वपूर्ण है, लेकिन हर दिन फ़िल्मी हीरो जैसा बिहेव नहीं करता मैं। हाँ, लेकिन प्रोपोज फ़िल्मी अंदाज में किया था। वैसे, पहले मेरे स्टंट से माँ परेशान रहती थी कि चोट लगेगी, अब वह रहती है, लेकिन मैंने मेरा काम करता रहता हूँ। मैं सच कहूँ, तो विद्युत के एक्शन को देखना पसंद करती हूँ और हर बार नया कुछ लेकर आते हैं, ऐसे में खुदा हाफ़िज़ चैप्टर 2 अग्नि परीक्षा , जो कि 8 जुलाई 2022 को रिलीज हो रही है और फिल्म खास होगी।"

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Australian Chef, Gary Mehigan, who is known for his stint in Masterchef Australia, has made plenty of visits to India, however, this one is rather special. The celebrity chef has collaborated with Conosh for a three city culinary tour in India, where the selected theme for the Mumbai masterclass was ‘Summer Eggless Dessert’. In a candid chat with me, Gary Mehigan , dove into the details about what he is expecting out of this to tour, the evolution in the Indian food space and more! We know for a fact that your love for India keeps bringing you back to the country, what are you expecting from your visit this time? “Well, I have been here about 10 days now and have just had the most incredible experience filming in Leh Ladakh for the Hemis festival. I was so looking forward to it, and it exceeded all my expectations. And now, I am onto my work with Conosh, an experience dining and culinary learning platform, with a hands-on masterclass in Mumbai, and then we travel to Kolkata and do a hands-on masterclass and a curated dinner.” In the last few years, do you see an evolution in the culinary space or food industry in India? “Absolutely, what Chefs like Thomas Zachariah, Pooja Dhingra, Prateek Sadhu, Varun Totlani and legends like Manish Mehrotra and Ranveer Brar are continuing to do by sharing and creating great food experiences, has really put India in the spotlight as a Culinary destination.” From your previous visits, can you share a culinary experience or moment that had an impact on you? “Every time I come to India, I learn something new about your cuisine. I always take back at least one new recipe from Chefs or friends along the way. Also, meeting people who love food at events like the dinner pop-ups I do with Conosh is a very enriching experience.” Is there a wish list of things to do during your India visit this time? “Well, I have just ticked off a big one by filming in Leh Ladakh, which was just jaw-dropping. Way beyond my expectations. Next time I get a chance for some leisure here, I want to go back to Goa, see more of the Himalayas, and perhaps do a motorbike ride from Manali to Leh. It sounds quite challenging, and definitely on a Royal Enfield.” Do you remember the first time you tried out an Indian dish, which one was it and what was the experience like? “I have been cooking curries for years, but I had to cook a Dosa for a TV show, and it took me some time to perfect, but I had quite a few contacts from my visits to India on speed dial helping me.” If you could pick one Bollywood celebrity to cook for and dine with, who would it be and why? “Amitabh Bachchan. I think he would have some great stories to tell.” Well, being an epicurean, this meet and greet and chat sesh with Gary for me was definitely a wholesome experience and one where I have taken back learnings and memories to cherish. All I can say is that I cannot wait to meet this Masterchef soon and hopefully, there’ll be more anecdotes to spill and meal to discuss and share."

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Melbourne, in Australia, is one of the hottest travel destinations right now. It has got everything you need to make your next vacation, a wholesome one. From outdoor activities to a variety of cultural experiences, it would not be wrong of me to say that there is something for everyone in Melbourne, Victoria. Looking for an itinerary of what to do when in and around Melbourne, don’t worry I’ve got you covered. For cricket lovers to wine connoisseurs, here are 7 attractions you should definitely not miss out on, on your next trip there… 1. Melbourne Cricket Ground If you are a cricket fan, this one should definitely be on your list. Also known as ‘The G’ , it holds a lot of cultural importance in the cricket world. Situated between the suburbs of East Melbourne and Richmond, this place is only a fifteen-minute walk away from the city. There are some iconic landmarks in the stadium that you as a cricket fan can cherish forever like the MCC Long Room, portrait of Sir Donald Bradman, MCC Library, a walk in the arena and the City Terrace with the best views of Melbourne’s skyline. But as an Indian, something that might make your heart skip a beat is the portrait of the legendary Sachin Tendulkar in the stadium. 2. Melbourne Zoo Australia is widely known for its wildlife and the Melbourne Zoo is a place people of all ages will definitely enjoy. A day at the zoo is a must on your itinerary when visiting Melbourne. The zoo has around 320 species, which includes unique Australian wildlife like Kangaroos, Koalas, and Orangutans. The underwater world at the zoo boasts of Victorian penguins and fur seals which will make for the perfect day for your kids. And that is not all, you can also stroll through the lush rainforests where tigers roam and monkeys are seen swinging. Not all of these species are something that you will find in India, so as an Indian tourist, this should definitely be on your itinerary. 3. Federation Square Located at the heart of the city, Fed Square boasts of a very happening and bustling life. From world-class art galleries to a diverse range of food, this is the place you should definitely hit with your friends and family on your next trip to Melbourne. Looking to hop into a club with your mates? Or wish to splurge on some retail therapy? Then this location is the perfect way to end your day or even spend your afternoons at by just sitting and relaxing or reading a book in the middle of Fed Square! 4. Twelve Apostles These magnificent rocks that arise from the Southern Ocean on Victoria’s coastline are an unmissable experience for every tourist. Just a four-hour drive from Melbourne, the best time to witness their splendid beauty is during sunset. You can also view the 12 Apostles in a helicopter ride if you wish to take this experience to another level. Now how can one say no to this? I surely cannot. 5. Grampians Here’s a National Park that is loaded with activities for you to take on. If you’re someone who is looking to chase waterfalls, this is the go-to place for you. As you hike through the Grampians National Park, you will be rewarded with some of the most majestic waterfalls and rock pools. As an Indian tourist, you will thoroughly enjoy these clean water bodies and I would highly recommend visiting the MacKenzie waterfall . Apart from this, you can also visit the wine region in the Grampians and sip at scenic views with your loved ones. 6. Wine Tours at Yarra Valley and Dandenong Ranges Looking for a relaxing day as you sip on your wine and eat some delicious cheese? We’ve got the perfect go-to place for you. Visit Domaine Chandon for a premium sparkling wine tour, or stop at the Yarra Valley Dairy or the Yarra Valley Chocolaterie to nibble on some snacks. Sipping wine with a scenic landscape view, isn’t that everything a vacation should be about? 7. Geelong and the Bellarine Soak up the good life in the Geelong and Bellarine region by exploring Geelong’s waterfront precinct, and tranquil seaside villages, and meeting local makers and growers along the Bellarine Taste Trail. For a perfect summer afternoon, wander down historic streetscapes and tee off at lush golf courses. Indulge in the burgeoning foodie scene, complete with craft breweries, local wineries, farm gates and provedores. Enjoy the pleasant breeze and the ocean view while you surf, paddle and swim at the bay and beaches. There are more than these seven attractions that Melbourne and Regional Victoria have to offer to you, but I guess you will have to visit and explore the rest! So, when are you planning your next trip? All images are owned by Visit Victoria."

Recently, a famous paparazzo revealed details about Anushka and Virat’s daughter, Vamika, leaving everyone in complete shock! Recently, during an Ask Me Anything session on Reddit hosted by Varinder Chawla, fans flooded the comments section with various questions. One fan asked about the appearance of Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli ’s daughter, specifically who she resembles more. Chawla responded that Vamika looked like Anushka. However, this sparked a flurry of responses from fans who seemed to disagree. One user remarked, “He hasn’t seen Vamika, clearly,” while another commented, “Haha, seriously, she’s a mini Virat.” From my perspective, even though opinions differ, Vamika actually looks more like Virat Kohli based on the glimpses we’ve seen. I, along with many others, eagerly await the day when Anushka, Virat, Vamika, and Akaay share a family photo, whenever they feel comfortable.

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Social media has been in our lives for over 10 years now and with each day passing by it’s just growing bigger and better, right? When one signs up on these social media apps they’re bound to be criticized irrespective of their craft and how amazing they are as a person. Especially when it’s a famous personality that now includes creators as well. To depict the trolls each person goes through and how they feel about the same, Khushaal Pawaar has come out with ‘ Trollistan ‘. It’s his first-ever long format video and we think you should totally check it out for yourself as it’s worth the watch! Trollistan is a mockumentary video in a fantasy world that features the trollers who troll people on social media, comment nasty and unnecessary comments, and make fun of people on their personality, looks, fashion, etc. Khushaal has dedicated this video to all his supporters and fans that have been there with him no matter what. For the very same reason, he did a special screening for them. Yes, you read that right! Khushaal invited and selected a few people for a special screening that he had organized as a gesture of giving back the love he receives from his fans. The amount of energy, laughter and cheer with which the audience has reacted to his video truly shows how loved this video is by many. If you check out the Reel above, you’d see how each of them had something different and unique to talk about the creative concept he came out with! Khushaal as always had a wonderful, hilarious as well as a relatable script. From the costume and dialect of his first-ever long format video to the cast everything was perfect and too damn good. The entire cast including Jimesh Patel (who plays Gulab ) and Hamza Syed (who’s the interviewer) had such interesting roles to play that we loved their word plays and humor. Nowadays anything said directly isn’t understood by many and we feel this is a very creative and indirect way of telling the trollers to stop what they’re doing and put themselves in the other persons’ shoes. Besides this, if you’re an influencer or just a user you should totally watch this just for a few laughs.

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! They say marriages are made in heaven and we can clearly see that through Simran Balar Jain and Nikhil Khabiya ‘s wedding pictures. Here’s a lil ‘ back story about them. Simran is a video creator who breaks stereotypes on various topics. She met Nikhil in school and they started off being classmates, bench mates, best friends, lovers and now each other’s partners in crime. Yes, they’re married and if you are someone who loves uniqueness or is soon going to be a groom or bride you should totally scroll down to know all about # SiNikWedding’ s beautiful and creative wedding concepts! Proposal is the very first step to a happy ending and a start of a beautiful journey. The way Nikhil proposed Simran was really out of the box and definitely very filmy. Btw , check out Simran’s page to know how she proposed to Nikhil in the city of love, Paris. It really teared us up! <3 Simran’s close friends gave her a surprise bachelorette party and the bridesmaids planned some really creative games to play throughout the night. Through this Reel, we can defo say that the party was filled with loads of games, cake, fun and dancing. Did you know for a fact that Simran’s engagement was on the same day as her birthday? Well, this totally caused for double the celebrations. Hence, Nikhil being a super amazing fiancee surprised her with a life-size cut-out of their honeymoon tickets to her dream destination, Europe. Their sangeet was filled with so much love. There were a couple of beautiful performances, a very dreamy bride and groom entry with balloons and a special dance by Simran for her first best friend, her dad. As you can see in the above Reel , they had a 360-degree camera to capture all their wonderful moments together which were absolutely priceless. When we saw these pictures the first song that came to our mind was ‘ Kesariya Tera Ishq Hai Piya ‘ ‘ cause it fits so perfectly. But the Reels she posted on her Haldi ceremony are so colourful and they totally gave us the feel-good vibes. They had a nice dance rivalry between the groom and bride’s team which was honestly very interesting to watch. Check it out for yourself! And here’s the day when their happily ever after began! We’re so happy for the two of them and wish them all the love and light in their future journeys together. Btw , read what Simran had to say about being a new bride… First of all, let me say that I was welcomed with so much love, care, and many gifts. In all honesty, acclimating to a new environment takes time with a range of emotions. In the beginning, you kinda also see a different version of yourself, one that is extremely feminine with sindoor, mangalsutra, and chudha. According to you, which was your favourite wedding function and why? My favourite part of the wedding was the main Phera ceremony, where my brothers held the ‘phoolon ki chadar’ whereas my sister and bridesmaids walked towards the mandap holding cute template cards. Since Phera represents the moment you tie the knot with your life partner in front of your family and friends, it has special for me. It was a very moving and sentimental time as my parents, siblings, brother-in-law and best friends signed my lehenga to keep all the memories intact. There was a contract at your wedding, which you made the groom change. Tell us a little more about this. The entire contract was created by the groom’s side as a joke, and it was loaded with clauses they knew I wouldn’t accept. They gave me the actual ‘contract’, which depicts the bride and groom playing equal roles after I rejected the initial contract as expected by everyone. The idea for the contract came from the groom’s side, and the first contract had a few clauses that I didn’t like. They were astute enough to obtain a second contract that was planned in advance, contained fair terms, and was centered on the equality of the bride and groom. You had really different concepts in your wedding shenanigans which made it very unique! How did you come up with these ideas? I looked at numerous Reels, read numerous blogs about wedding entry ideas and concepts, watched numerous YouTube videos, and also talked about it with my event manager. We combined our thoughts to produce each concept. Lastly, share a message for all the brides-to-be out there? Don’t try to be someone else, doing so will only provide you with fleeting satisfaction. Instead, be yourself. Don’t forget to be yourself and make sure you are content, comfortable, and happy when trying to make other people happy. Ensure that you get adequate rest, sleep, and water. Please refrain from experimenting with new skincare or haircare products. You don’t need to go on a crash diet or lose weight to look gorgeous on your wedding day. Just be yourself and confident. All in all, their fairytale wedding was filled with lots of love and fun and we hope they’re always in love today and forever.

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Social media plays a very important role in all our lives, right? Even if we’re bored just for a few minutes the first thing we’d do is pick up our phones to scroll through different apps or just aimlessly switch between apps , haha . But since social media has taken over our lives so much hence on the occasion of # WorldSocialMediaDay we wanted to know what would creators do if social media did not exist. Hence, we got a chance to ask a few creators about their alternative career options and their answers will literally blow your mind away. Really, we kid you not. Scroll down to know it all. A post shared by Ashi Khanna (@ashi_khanna) Maybe if not content creation or in front of the camera per se, I might have gone behind the camera and joined the production. Pretty good with arranging and managing stuff, while I could’ve also learnt more about cameras and lighting since that intrigues my interest a lot. A post shared by Zaid Darbar (@zaid_darbar) If not a content creator then I would be an Interior designer or an actor. I have always loved designing spaces be it my studio Atrangz or my house. I always see things with a different perspective and make it look worth it and talking about acting I’ve always had that actor in me and I love to pour out emotions through it. A post shared by Dhruv Shah (@shahdhruv1994) One way or another, I would definitely take a deep dive into the world of digital media. If content creation would not have happened, I can definitely see myself choosing digital marketing as an alternative career. Just the way I tell stories through my content, digital marketing too is all about telling a story that appeals to a target audience. If I wouldn’t have been making people laugh, I would be making them buy. A post shared by T A N Z E E L™ (@tanzeel_khan03) The passion to create is something I’ve always harboured, creation is not just about writing or singing, building is also creating. Had I not been creating content, if I wasn’t crooning a tune or penning a track, I may have explored engineering as a profession. A post shared by Shyam Sharma (@shyam_sharma) If not for content creation, you would still be seeing me in front of the camera, maybe the medium would have shifted from a portable screen to the silver screen. The acting bug has bitten me since time immemorial and I cannot imagine a career that does not involve performing. The journey would have been different, the medium would have been different but the dream would be the same, to entertain. A post shared by Karan Sonawane (@focusedindian) I am more than happy with the choices I have made in my life until now, but if I wouldn’t have been a content creator I would’ve probably been in the entertainment industry, somewhere in the technical department like edit, light, direction or DOP, anything at all because growing up I was highly influenced and fascinated by the entertainment industry, still am. I loved and still love entertaining people and I wanted to do it in any way possible. I also dreamt of becoming a cricketer, though this plausible profession choice came about to me, quite late as I was descending into adulthood. This is when I thought to myself that the considerable amount of the time I had to do something about this as a prospective career has passed away, so I’ll deal with whatever cards life has dealt me with which has led me to this! But I will always be open to anything the entertainment industry has to offer me. A post shared by Anmol Sachar (@anmolsachar) I always wanted to be a filmmaker. I love telling stories & entertaining people. If social media didn’t exist, I’d most likely be a filmmaker & for some reason, if that didn’t workout, I’d still be doing something creative like writing copy for ads or something on those lines. A post shared by Saurabh Ghadge (@saurabhghadge_vines) I’m really happy with the way life currently is. But if I wasn’t a content creator, I would definitely have been working in sports. I’ve always wanted to be a cricketer as a child, but that, unfortunately, didn’t workout for me. So the most logical thing would be to opt for sports management due to my love and passion for cricket. I would be either studying sports management abroad or doing a 9 to 5 job in this field. A post shared by Ruhii Siingh (@ruhisingh12) If social media didn’t exist, it would have made no difference to my life as such. I am very happy and passionate about my acting and modelling career and I’m grateful to have worked in both fields with respectable names and to have actually learned a lot. Honestly, the only reason I am motivated to be on social media is because it gives me an opportunity to connect with my fans, and they’re all very sweet, so I’m really grateful for that. A post shared by Jake Sitlani (@jakesitlani) I would love to be a director just cause I would love to give a bunch of audiences my take and view on various social topics on a larger scale since our culture & society needs it. A post shared by D I K S H A (@diksharawat22) If I was not a content creator what would I be? This question gives me a little existential crisis but I’d probably have an organization/nonprofit, to help in raising money for animals around India. It’s something that is very important to me & I try to do a little in a small capacity. It’s not just an alternate career it’s something I’ll eventually dive into. I want to have my own nonprofit, working for animals & animal rescuing. It’s a very consuming job & I don’t know if I have the heart to do it but we will know soon. A post shared by Tarini Shah | Content creator (@tarini_shah) Just before I started content creation I was a fan of math and statistics. I was working towards studying Actuarial Science so yes, I might have been an Actuary. My love for stats is really helping me out now with social media analytics. I guess some things just never change. A post shared by Aastha Shah (@aasthashah97) I would be a Financial Analyst or an Equity Research Analyst. I’ve always loved playing around with numbers and researching about different companies to analyze them closely. Currently, I’m a CFA level 3 candidate so yes if not a content creator, I would definitely pursue something in finance. Well, all their alternative careers sound super interesting but we’re so glad all of them are into content creation ‘ cause they defo at some point in life have made us smile, laugh and relate to their content. On that note, follow @missmalinitrending to get more information about your fave influencers, trends and creators. Stay safe!"

She also hopes to educate and inspire women of all ages, ethnicities, and creeds. A post shared by Tanya Appachu | Lawyer (@yourinstalawyer) The Reel above which is about ‘Rajasthan High court gives a guy 15 days of parole to make his wife pregnant’ is one of her viral videos and the second one is ‘Employment Laws’.

Social media has given me the opportunity to reach out to so many of you and create an impact on so many lives and give you the power to question things with just a piece of information. I believe knowledge is power and I aim to empower everyone one short video at a time. Her page is super insightful and filled with so many things that we didn’t know we were eligible for.

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Karan Johar’s much-awaited film romantic-comedy, ‘Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani,’ features the dynamic duo of Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt in the lead roles, supported by an impressive cast including Shabana Azmi, Jaya Bachchan , and Dharmendra , along with many others. Advance bookings for this film started recently and the movie has reportedly already sold an approximate of around 31,000 tickets for its opening day in the top 3 national cinema chains. A post shared by Dharma Productions (@dharmamovies) According to a report from Hindustan Times, Girish Johar predicted the film’s opening on Friday could range anywhere between ₹8-10 crore, and there are hopes for increased collections over the weekend. If the audience truly embraces the movie and it manages to achieve double-digit figures on the first day, maintaining and even reaching around ₹12 crore on the second and third days, it could easily accumulate ₹35-40 crore during its first weekend. Anything surpassing this would be exceptional, but falling short of these expectations would indicate that the film couldn’t resonate with the audience as anticipated. However, only time will tell how it performs. He also said “It is the one big film after Pathaan. We have had Zara Hatke Zara Bachke and Satyaprem Ki Katha (that performed well at the box office) this year, but these were mid-budget films.” A post shared by Dharma Productions (@dharmamovies) The promotions of this film is going great and full of energy which has caused the anticipation of the audience to reach an all time high. I am also really looking forward to this upcoming film and I am all set to see it tomorrow! Check: Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani Review"

    "article_content": "Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! Hi Guest Join India's #1 source for updates! When Karan Johar sits on the director’s chair, there’s a reason why everyone’s expectations of experiencing cinema in an enhanced manner heightens. With Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, I felt this by every bit and beyond. The stellar star cast, inclusive of Alia Bhatt, Ranveer Singh, Jaya Bachchan, Dharmendra, and Shabana Azmi manages to fill up the screen with their magic getting the audience to experience every emotion. The storyline stays true to the predictions made when the trailer was dropped, with a few elements of pleasant surprises. So, here is the Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani movie review. Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani revolves around the love story of Rocky Randhawa ( Ranveer Singh ) and Rani Chatterjee ( Alia Bhatt ), who belong to contrasting worlds but meet thanks to star-crossed lovers from within their family (no, I’m not giving spoilers!) from years ago. Amid the efforts of bringing the lovers from the past together, a new love blossoms and this marks the beginning of the drama within the households that unfold. Rocky and Rani decide to live in each other’s house for 3 months to get their families to know them better and help Rocky and Rani get a chance to win over the families too. Along the path, the stereotypical practises of patriarchy and classism within the households are met with realisations of how to get with the times and bring the much needed change. Karan Johar brings this love story to life with the perfect casting of Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt. Along with foundation of love, Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani generously has with some hilarious comic moments that’ll get you laughing and emotional moments that’ll get you teary-eyed. The songs with the magnanimous sets ensure that not only are your ears but also your eyes are treated to the grandeur. The snow clad Kashmir locales with the tunes of ‘Tum Kya Mile’ sure helped me feel the Yash Raj classic Bollywood romance. There were quite a few Bollywood references that were predicted in the trailer and as the songs dropped one by one. To all those who could feel the 2 States and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham vibe in the snippets before the release, there’s a dash of that too for you! Jaya Bachchan saying, “Keh Diya Na, Bas Keh Diya” is what I’ve longed to hear since years, and never imagined for it to come true, until today! Not to forget the wonderful performance of Ranveer Singh and Tota Roy Chowdhury on Dola Re Dola that Dhindhora Baje Re reminded everyone of. TBH, KJo played it smart by ensuring that the predictions being a part of the film would put the chitter chatter to rest in the best manner. So if you’re looking at experiencing Bollywood in the most stereotypical, entertaining, best way ever… Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani is a must-watch."

    "article_content": "Though we are aware about health and conditions more than we ever have been but till date reading a blood report can make us scratch our heads sometimes 05 Oct, 2022 Kashish Sharma Amid the flu season, blood tests become a standard part of healthcare. In times when diseases like dengue, COVID-19, and other viral infections confuse us with overlapping symptoms, a blood test comes handy. Though we have been much aware about health and conditions than we have ever been but till date reading a blood report can make us scratch our heads sometimes. Complicating terms and abbreviations tend to intimidate us. Let us try to make sense of a simple blood report. You must note this is no replacement to a doctor’s analysis of the report. This value stands for the number of white blood cells in your body. White blood cells or WBCs are like soldiers of your body, protecting you against germs and preventing the spread of infection in the body. A high TLC could suggest some infection in the body whereas a low count of it can suggest conditions that weakens immune system. This value is a measure of a protein present inside the red blood cells that carries oxygen from lungs to all parts of the body. This test is useful in diagnosing anemia in which adequate amount of oxygen is not reaching all parts of the body. Unlike Hemoglobin, this value is a measure of RBCs and what proportion of blood they make. Since RBCs are carrying vehicles of hemoglobin, this value also helps in diagnosis of conditions like Anemia. This value is a measure of the average amount of hemoglobin present in each red blood cell. A high level of it can suggest anemia whereas a low value of it could suggest malnutrition and other conditions. This value measures the number of cells that help in blood clotting. If the value is high, it might suggest some infection or anemia and if the count is low then it could indicate risk of internal bleeding. This value is of utmost importance in diagnosing diseases like Dengue. This value is a measure of a biomarker that often helps in diagnosis of kidney and liver dysfunction. Abnormal values of this protein might indicate conditions like jaundice, anemia and liver diseases This value measures the level of a compound waste product that is formed as a byproduct of metabolic reactions in your body. This value indicates how well your kidneys are filtering the waste out of your body. A higher value of this metabolic waste can suggest kidney dysfunction. HDL (high-density lipoprotein) Cholesterol is useful in protecting your heart. Low levels of it can indicate the risk of developing a heart disease. Calculating this ratio can help determine an individual’s risk of developing a heart disease. It is worked out by dividing HDL cholesterol into total cholesterol. The value is measure of C-reactive protein in your blood. Your liver releases CRP into your bloodstream in response to inflammation. Healthcare providers use this test to help diagnose and monitor several different causes of inflammation, such as infections and certain autoimmune conditions. Thanks For Reading!"

Now that's what I would call a bad hair day. That's exactly why dry shampoo hit the market. I came across BBlunt's Back to Life dry shampoo in one of Scherezade Shroff 's (a popular YouTuber) videos. I decided to try it out after I read a lot of reviews about it and when I used it, I realised what all the fuss was about. Here's what I think of BBlunt's Back to Life dry shampoo. How to use it Yay or Nay It is a definite 'Yay' for me. It doesn't make your hair rough or greasy and helps you maintain that washed hair look throughout the day. However, I don't think it works as much when you are outdoors for most of the day. On those days, I would suggest you go for a tied up bun or pony tail instead of any other fancy hairstyles . You won't even have to apply any other product on your hair after using this dry shampoo, except for a setting spray, if required. It costs Rs 550/- for 125 ml and is easily available everywhere. I think you must own one of these. Have you used it already? Let me know your reviews in the comments below!

    "article_content": "Published by Tania Tarafdar | Published : February 20, 2017 5:18 PM IST No matter how beautiful your hairstyle is, it always ends up looking limp and dried out within a few hours on thin and rather fine hair. It's more or less been a task to have your hair look thicker and luscious, right? It is impossible to thicken each and every strand of your hair because genes control your hair and there is only so much you can do. Instead of just sitting and waiting for re-growth here are easy thin-hair hacks to get your hair to look thicker than they are. Opt for short haircuts : For fine hair, it's best to stick to short, mid-length haircuts. This is easier to maintain, adds more volume with the steps and layers and creates great texture. The bob cut would look just great or a chic blunt cut which is a little above your shoulders. You must eat these foods for thicker and stronger hair. Wear the perfect hair-parting : The appearance of your scalp makes your hair looks extremely scanty. So define your hair parting accordingly and don't clip or tie your hair too tight, this makes it look even flatter. Style lightly : Many of us may think that styling hair aggressively means that it would all happen much quicker. That's wrong! You may end up weighing down your natural-bouncy volume and damage your tresses in the process. Go easy while using rounded brushes and blow-drying. Here are a few hair care tips for different hair types. Flip your hair : If you want some natural volume and are leaving your hair loose, then bend down and flip your hair and jerk back. This lets your locks fall well on your face and keeps away from looking limp. The technique trades away your heated hair styling too. However, if you are losing hair all over, you can just consider wearing a wig. It is best that you work with your hair stylist to find the appropriate one. Find a wig that looks natural, falls flat at the root and matches your hair type. Watch the video for more such tips.

    "article_content": "Published by Tania Tarafdar | Published : March 9, 2017 3:30 PM IST Hair salons claim that they have maximum customers after Holi as women rush in to repair their damaged locks. Evaluating the harm done to your hair and skin during Holi, experts opine that you must take much more care of your hair than your skin, as the skin's recuperating capacities are more.Hair exposed to chemical colours can become dull, dry and brittle. Plus the over exposure to chemicals that strip your hair of its protective coating through inevitable repeated use of shampoos and you've got the perfect recipe for a hair disaster. We got you some useful tips for hair care before and after Holi. Also, read these 5 expert tips to protect your eyes during Holi. To survive the chemical colours, your hair needs that extra nourishment and protection. The simplest and most efficient method would be to massage your hair with a hair oil of your choice an hour or so before getting out for your Holi celebrations. The oil can form a protective coat on the external covering (cuticle) of your hair. This protects it from chemicals, dust and dirt. This also causes the colour to come off the hair quickly after you have finished playing. You can also use a mixture of jojoba and rosemary oil as it makes the right base oil for your hair. It prevents the harmful colours from settling down. The oil takes care of any dryness caused by the weather. It's also the best way to provide your hair (and skin) the extra nourishment it needs to survive the day. For better results, soak a towel in hot water and wrap it around your oiled hair. Leaving it like this for even half an hour will be enough to ensure penetration. While going out to play Holi, cover your hair with a bandana or a cap as this will save your scalp. Celebrity hairstylist Asgar Saboo also has a f ew tips to enjoy Holi without harming your hair.

    "article_content": "Published by Tania Tarafdar | Published : June 13, 2017 6:21 PM IST If you have curly hair or wavy hair, you probably know how difficult it can be to make it look smooth and tame. Especially if you decide to go on vacation to a place that is by the beach where the humidity levels are high. I faced the same situation when I visited Goa recently, sans any anti-frizz hair products. What made matters worse was the fact that I was expected to go for an event that required me to dress up. And that meant sleek hair that didn't make me look like I had been electrocuted. I came across this video with frizzy hair hacks which worked for me. So if your hair is equally frizzy try out these hacks and tell us in comments if they worked for you. Here are 7 anti-frizz products you need. You can also try this trick to tame frizzy hair. Step 1: Wash your hair with shampoo. Srep 2: Towel dry your hair and tie it up in a stable pony. Don't make it too tight as this can give you a headache, but it should be close enough that the hair on the crown of your head is pulled back. Step 3: Now, just below the hair tie, divide your hair into three sections and braid it into a tight plait. Remember to braid it right till the ends so that they curl too. Step 4: Once your hair is dry, open the twist and remove the hair tie to reveal tame and frizz free hair. Step 5: If you are in a hurry, you can use a blow dryer to dry your hair while it is still tied up. Step 6: Also, if you want small curls, it's a good idea to tie your hair up in small braids. To do this, divide your hair from the point that the hair tie starts and braid each of the sections separately. Here are 13 haircare mistakes people with curly hair make.

While it is more prominent in men, women too have been its victims. There are many hair restoration treatments available in the market today, but one needs to be careful about which one they opt for. The procedure needs to be genuine and reliable so that you do not suffer later. A bad hair transplant can worsen your condition. It is vital to learn about the treatment you plan to undergo in depth. In this video, well-known t richologist Dr Apoorva Shah explains hair restoration process in detail. There are different types of transplants. Here are top 10 reasons why you may be losing hair. Hair transplant- - In a hair transplant, grafts are removed from the back of the head and placed in areas where there is no hair or thinning is noticed. Scalp reduction -- In scalp reduction surgery, the bald patches are cut off, and the rest of the scalp is sewed back together. This makes one's head look full of hair once again, but it can leave a scar running down the middle of your head and also the skin stretches. Rotational flap surgery -- This is an old method of concealing hair loss. In rotational flap surgery, the tissues at the back of one's head are rotated so that they come back to the front of the head which immediately gives an impression of a full head of hair. Tissue expansion -- In tissue expansion, tissue expanders put under the skin where hair growth is maximum. This area is then inflated with saline water for a few weeks which stretches this skin and increases the hair-bearing area. Here are some causes of male pattern baldness.

    "article_content": "Published by Shaloo Tiwari | Updated : January 9, 2018 5:38 PM IST New moms, if you must be going through a lot of changes both physically and mentally after post-pregnancy , and these changes are natural. But post-pregnancy hair loss is probably one of the worst things that happen after you have a baby. However, according to expert trichologist Dr Apoorva Shah you must not be worried about the hair loss because it is a natural process, he goes on to say, 'During pregnancy, a woman will have amazing hair on earth due to increased estrogen level, the female hormone, during pregnancy. In fact, it is at its peak during pregnancy. Post pregnancy there is a strong dip in the estrogen level which in turn causes a post-partum hair loss that starts three months after the pregnancy and can go on until almost two years of pregnancy.' Post-pregnancy hair loss sometimes can be combatted by a mere improvement in the diet or a few supplements but many a time in extreme cases you also need a few treatments done to stop excessive hair loss and help regrow hair. According to Dr Apoorva, here are the steps you must take when you are experiencing extreme hair loss post-pregnancy. 1. Consult a trichologist. Do not delay in visiting an expert if you think things are going out of hand 2. Get the hair analysis done. This will reveal a lot about your hairs condition and its requirements. 3. Only based on the reports you must opt for the appropriate treatment for you The treatment that available in India to can treat post-pregnancy hair loss, that Dr Apoorva Shah suggests is the manual lymph drainage also called the TST treatment. This treatment from Austria if done along with taking an internal supplement which has minerals and vitamins in a combination. This treatment should also be accompanied by ample water and great hair foods like milk, palak, almonds, etc. For women even suffering from extreme hair loss post pregnancy this treatment can work wonders for her.

Too much pitta causes heat to go into the roots of the hair and burns and destroys the natural oils that are important to nourish the hair. When vata gets aggravated, it dries the scalp and the hair follicles. This can lead to problems like hair fall, itching, dandruff, greying, frizz, split ends etc. These hair problems are connected to our food. Certain foods aggravate hair fall. Similarly, environmental factors, stress and illness and the use of hair products can damage hair. Here are some hair care tips by Dr Partap Chauhan, director, Jiva Ayurveda, you must keep in mind. 2 /8 Hair Colour Use of chemicals in the form of colours, dyes, shampoos, sprays, gels and other styling agents get absorbed in the root of the hair and dries up the scalp.

Wash your hair and then pour the vinegar-water mixture onto your hair and scrub it into your scalp. Leave it on for about 15 minutes, and then wash it off with water. The acidity of apple cider vinegar changes the pH levels of your scalp, thereby destroying the growth of yeast. 2 /5 Baking Soda Take 1 tablespoon of baking soda. First, wet your hair then rub the baking soda into your hair and scalp. Leave it on for a minute, and then wash your hair thoroughly with water. Baking soda reduces excess oil on the scalp and is also known to reduce the overactive fungi that can cause dandruff.

Most of the mouthwash contains thymol and alcohol, which can cure cracked feet and soothe skin. It can also fight off toenail fungus and plantar warts on the feet. Vinegar on the other hand, has mild acids, which help throw out dead skin cells. 4 /5 Yoghurt Take 1 cup of plain yoghurt. Then rinse your hair with a normal shampoo. Apply the yoghurt to your scalp and leave it on for about 15 minutes. Rinse your hair, and again wash your hair using a small amount of shampoo. Yoghurt could be one of the ideal remedies for dandruff because it is a good source of probiotics.

    "article_content": "The summer is here and it brings with it blistering heat and a lot of sweat. In order to shield your skin from the damage that harmful sunrays can do , it is essential that you apply a good sunscreen on the exposed areas before you step outside. SPF stands for ‘sun protection factor’. It protects our skin against UV-B rays , the specific rays of the sun that cause tanning, sunburn and skin cancer. So when you look darker after a day out in the sun, it is due to those pesky UV-B rays. Technically, an SPF of 15 means that you can stay in the sun 15 times longer than without sunscreen before getting sunburnt. A sunscreen with SPF 30 is more than enough to handle the sun rays Indians are exposed to. Even though we are exposed to more UV-B rays than the western countries, our darker skin acts as good, natural protection. Organic agents absorb the UV-B light and prevent it from reaching the skin. There are many different ingredients that do this , but they stop working after about 3-4 hours, so the sunscreen needs to be reapplied regularly. Inorganic or mineral agents reflect UV-B light.

So regular use of sunscreen will keep your skin glowing and young! UV-B light causes tanning and skin cancer. So UV-B protection is also extremely important.

    "article_content": "Written by Arushi Bidhuri | Updated : March 2, 2021 10:42 AM IST 1 /6 Ghee Benefits For Hair Ghee, also known as clarified butter, is a staple in Indian dishes that makes them even more delicious. There is no doubt that it is one of the most treasured foods in Ayurveda that not only spruces up your dishes but provides many other health, skin and hair benefits. This versatile culinary staple is packed to the brim with numerous benefits for your hair. As scientists continue to debate the health benefits of ghee, we bring you its benefits for hair. These days we are bombarded with hair care products that contain all sorts of chemicals, which are harmful to your hair. If you too want to switch to something organic, Ghee is the one you should pick. Without further ado, let’s look at the hair benefits of this favourite Indian food. 2 /6 Ghee Massage For Hair Growth Looking for ways to help your hair grow naturally? Switch to ghee. Massaging warm ghee in your hair will enable smooth blood circulation in your scalp, which in turn will promote hair growth. It contains healthy fats and fatty acids, which nourishes the scalp and prompts hair growth. Also Read - Can Meningioma Be Treated With Radiation Therapy? 3 /6 Ghee – The Natural Hair Conditioner It contains antioxidants and fatty acids, both of which makes it easily absorbable into the scalp. It is capable of deep conditioning and repairing dry and damaged hair. Apply ghee on your hair and cover it with a shower cap. Leave it overnight and rinse it with normal water in the morning. 4 /6 Restore Hair Texture With Ghee From hair colours to styling, people today indulge in a lot of experiments that cause more damage to your hair than good. In the process, hair loses its natural shine and lustre, which becomes difficult to restore but ghee can help you with that. Heat a spoonful of ghee and rub it in your scalp and hair. Let it sit for a few hours and wash it with shampoo. Do this twice a week to see effective results. Also Read - Exploring The Influence Of Lifestyle Choices For Radiant Skin 5 /6 Bid Adieu To Split Ends One of the primary reasons that cause split ends is excessive styling. But ghee can nourish split ends, which are basically undernourished. Rich in nutrients like vitamin A, D, K2 and E, and antioxidants, ghee is beneficial for your hair. All you need to do is warm some ghee and apply it directly to your split ends. Rinse with a mild shampoo and cold water after an hour. 6 /6 Got Frizzy Hair? Use Ghee Detangling frizzy hair is a task we all want to avoid. Frizzy hair is prone to breakage and thinning, which is why it is better to treat them with a natural solution that will help you get rid of the frizz and roughness. Containing moisturizing properties, ghee can help improve the texture of your hair and make it smooth, shiny and bouncy. Also Read - What's On My Plate: How Many Calories Are In Potato Cutlets?

    "article_content": "Written by Arushi Bidhuri | Updated : August 18, 2021 2:31 PM IST 1 /10 Colour Your Hair With Caution After spending almost two years staying indoors, people are experimenting when it comes to their appearance. One of the most famous trends in hair colouring. It is a common beauty regime done by many men and women these days. Bleaching your hair gives you confidence, an ecstatic feeling, and most importantly, it prevents you from crying over your original hair colour. We all love a bit of a change, but not one that can damage your hair permanently. 2 /10 Pre And Post Colour Application To save you from the misery, we talked to celebrity dermatologist and director of Cutis skin studio, Dr Apratim Goel to know what people should keep in mind when it comes to taking care of your tresses pre and post colour application. As much as we want to keep up with the latest trend it is also important to take care of your tresses as the chemicals used for hair colouring often leave the hair dry and brittle. Here are the tips suggested by Dr Goel, take a look. Also Read - Can Meningioma Be Treated With Radiation Therapy? 3 /10 Choose The Hair Colour Mindfully The more hydrogen peroxide is used to lighten the hair colour the more damage it causes to the hair. Try to choose a hair colour within 3 shades closer to your natural shade to minimize damage. 4 /10 Look Out For Scalp Infections If you are suffering from scalp conditions like psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis, ask your dermatologist before colouring. These conditions are limited to the scalp and do not occur on hair, so hair colour can be used. However, caution needs to be taken to not aggravate the condition. Also Read - Exploring The Influence Of Lifestyle Choices For Radiant Skin 5 /10 Do A Patch Test Prior If you are using store-bought hair dyes, make sure to do a patch test on a small portion before applying it all over. If you get a reaction, do not use the dye, and visit your dermatologist. 6 /10 Avoid Sun Exposure Once you have coloured your hair, avoid direct sun exposure as the hair is more prone to damage and can become drier and easily break Also Read - What's On My Plate: How Many Calories Are In Potato Cutlets? 7 /10 Allergies Are Possible Avoid hair dyes containing PPD as it is one of the comment ingredients that can cause allergies. PPD (paraphenylenediamine) is a chemical compound that is commonly used in permanent hair dyes. PPD is used in hair dye because it is a permanent dye with a natural appearance that may be shampooed or permed without losing its colour. 8 /10 Conditioning Is Important If you have coloured hair, deep conditioning is key. Coloured hair can become easily dry and prone to breakage, and deep conditioning helps to improve hair elasticity by retaining moisture. This prevents breakage. Conditioner penetrates the hair shaft and helps to restore the natural shine to the hair. Deep condition once a week. You can use heat while deep conditioning for better penetration of products like steam or hot towel wrap.

    "article_content": "Written by Editorial Team | Updated : March 24, 2024 11:43 AM IST I am sure, you too are eagerly waiting for Holi . It is one of the biggest festivals in India. However, amid all this, our skin and hair face a lot of problems. Sunlight, colours, and water can dry out your hair. This causes hair breakage, and the problem of dullness can also increase. This may lead to havoc on your hair, leading to a myriad of problems. This is precisely the reason why Holi hair care is important. However, with the right knowledge and proactive measures, we can shield our tresses from damage. First, let's see how Holi colours can affect your hair . Hair can be damaged due to chemical-based and synthetic colours. These colours penetrate the hair shaft and make them lighter. Not only this, but these colours can also snatch away the natural oils from the scalp and lead to hair breakage . The chemicals in Holi colours may also irritate the scalp, causing itching, redness, and inflammation. Scratching the irritated scalp can further damage the hair follicles and exacerbate existing scalp conditions. More News You must have noticed that when you come out after taking a bath post Holi revelry, your hair becomes difficult to manage. Too much humidity, colour, and water make hair frizzy. The remaining chemicals and colours may irritate the scalp further and hair becomes rough and tangled. Do you colour your hair? You should know that Holi colours may affect it. Colours that contain harsh chemicals and artificial colours react with the pigments in coloured hair. Due to this, pigmentation may occur. The chemicals in Holi colours can strip away the artificial colour molecules from the hair shaft, leading to rapid fading of the hair dye. Holi colours can leave stubborn stains on coloured hair, especially if the hair is porous or damaged. Now, since you are aware of all the adverse effects that Holi colours can have on your hair, scroll down to see how you can keep your tresses safe. var firstScrolled3 = false; window.addEventListener(\"scroll\",(event) => { if(!firstScrolled3) { window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-m\", container: \"taboola-mid-article-thumbnails\", placement: \"Mid Article Thumbnails\", target_type: \"mix\" }); firstScrolled3 = true; } }); Apply lukewarm oil on your hair in the morning on the day of Holi. This will ensure good blood circulation in your head and the colours will not harm the hair. Apart from this, you can also apply natural gel like aloe vera gel on the hair. This will act as a barrier. You can also apply coconut or almond oil to your hair the night before Holi. If your scalp is oily, then apply oil in the morning. The chemicals present in the colour harm your hair. After playing Holi, rinse coloured hair thoroughly with cold or lukewarm water to remove colour particles. If you have coloured hair, use a shampoo that is made for coloured hair to thoroughly clean your hair and scalp. Gently massage the shampoo into your scalp and hair and then rinse with water. Deep conditioning is necessary to prevent damage caused by colour . To retain the moisture of your hair, apply a hair mask . This will make your hair soft and shiny. The day after Holi, apply lukewarm oil on the scalp and massage it thoroughly. Wrap hair with a hot towel and then wash hair with mild shampoo and conditioner. You can also apply argan oil or shea butter on your hair. Avoid styling your hair, immediately after Holi. This can cause more damage to your hair . Instead of drying your hair with a dryer, air dry it.

    "article_content": "Written by Tavishi Dogra | Updated : March 27, 2024 11:23 AM IST For centuries, olives have been an essential part of the Mediterranean diet , praised for their health benefits and often called 'liquid gold'. They have also gained popularity in the beauty industry, particularly as a hair care product. Dermatologists frequently meet patients looking for natural remedies for hair problems , and olive oil is often a topic of discussion. So, let's delve into the science behind this age-old practice and explore the potential benefits of olive oil for your hair . Olive oil's magic lies in its composition. Extra virgin olive oil, the purest form, is rich in fatty acids, mainly oleic acid. Oleic acids act as emollients, softening and moisturizing the hair, while fatty acids enhance moisture retention, resulting in better hydration, softer texture, and reduced breakage . Beyond essential hydration, olive oil offers exciting possibilities for hair growth. Studies suggest that a compound called oleuropein may directly stimulate hair follicles. Olive oil's reputation as a hair care hero isn't just a myth. People have used this kitchen staple for centuries to promote healthy, beautiful hair, and there's some science to back it up. Here's a deeper dive into olive oil . More News There aren't any risks involved in using olive oil, but there are a few things you should keep in mind while using olive oil: Always do a patch test first. var firstScrolled3 = false; window.addEventListener(\"scroll\",(event) => { if(!firstScrolled3) { window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-m\", container: \"taboola-mid-article-thumbnails\", placement: \"Mid Article Thumbnails\", target_type: \"mix\" }); firstScrolled3 = true; } }); Use a light amount. Overuse of olive oil can lead to product buildup. Using olive oil on the hair once a week is plenty. Olive oil should not be used as a styling product. Consistency and proper application are crucial to unlocking olive oil's benefits . This natural remedy takes time to work, and you can experiment with different methods, such as pre-shampoo treatment, leave-in conditioner, or mixing it with other nourishing ingredients like avocado, eggs, or honey.

There are many products in the market which are specially designed keeping summer hair care in mind. But their effect is neither permanent nor are they so effective that they can be trusted. Therefore, instead of spending your money on these products, you can benefit by including some ingredients present in your kitchen in your hair care routine.

Evidence suggests vitamin D deficiency can lead to hair loss and other hair problems. Vitamin D is mainly linked to healthy immune function and bone health. However, its role in promoting hair growth is gaining traction in dermatology and trichology. Several research studies have demonstrated that vitamin D influences hair growth. When we consume enough vitamin D, it promotes follicle growth and healthy and lustrous hair. Before delving deeper into the link between hair growth and vitamin D, it's pertinent to discuss the essential role of vitamin D and the hair growth cycle. Body upon exposure to sunlight, seafood, fatty fish, egg yolk, cheese, milk, and fortified foods mineralisation, calcium absorption, and immune functioning. The hair growth process comprises three stages, explains Nutritionist Aman Puri, Founder of Steadfast Nutrition: More News The anagen phase is the active growth stage during which hair follicles produce new hair strands; the catagen phase is when hair follicles prepare to enter the resting phase; and the telogen phase is when hair shredding happens before the cycle restarts.

    "article_content": "Written by Tavishi Dogra | Updated : June 1, 2024 12:13 PM IST Ascorbic Acid, generally understood as Vitamin C, is an essential micronutrient our body requires. It helps to protect cells and keep them healthy, as well as bones and blood vessels. It also helps to make collagen, an essential protein the body uses to make cartilage, skin, tendons, and ligaments. It ultimately helps heal wounds while repairing and maintaining teeth and bones. That is why Vitamin C is a great immunity booster and helps the body fight against diseases. Vitamin C is now being used as a critical ingredient in skincare. However, it can help hair growth as well. Even though a Vitamin C deficiency can lead to dry hair and split ends, supplying the body with more micronutrients can promote hair health. Amla, or Indian Gooseberry, is known for its impact on hair. For a long, it has been consumed raw as jam, and some mix it in henna to get the desired result for hair. Even today, not many know that amla is a potent ingredient in Ayurvedic medicine and can help deal with many hair-related problems. More News It detoxifies the body and helps aid digestion, leading to better metabolism. When your body feels better from the inside, it also impacts hair health. For hair, amla juice can help strengthen roots, making hair silky and smooth while preventing premature greying , a problem that people of all ages face. Amla, commonly found in UP and Rajasthan in India, finds many ways to be consumed in the country. Thus, amla pulp can be ingested as it is, in pickle form, or as juice to gain maximum benefit. The most beneficial way to consume amla would be in juice form, as one can get concentrated pulp and reap more benefits even with less quantity. Make sure you drink fresh, cold-pressed amla juice. And, of course, it should be preservative-free. As a consumer, how would you know that the juice is made of fresh amlas? It will be pulpy rather than liquid and will have less water content and more nutrient concentration. Sedimentation occurs naturally in such products and proves that you are consuming the natural product, where no thickening agent has been added. It must be consumed within one month of opening the bottle and stored in a cool place. Consume 30 ml of amla juice mixed with a cup of warm water once in the morning immediately after you wake up and then once half an hour after dinner. Within a week, the impact will help hair health, give you clear skin, and help your digestive system. So, imbibe Vitamin C and Amla and lead a healthier life. var firstScrolled3 = false; window.addEventListener(\"scroll\",(event) => { if(!firstScrolled3) { window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-m\", container: \"taboola-mid-article-thumbnails\", placement: \"Mid Article Thumbnails\", target_type: \"mix\" }); firstScrolled3 = true; } }); Don’t Miss Out on the Latest Updates.

    "article_content": "Written by Tavishi Dogra | Updated : May 21, 2024 12:32 PM IST 1 /5 Total Fertility Rate India's dropping birth rate poses a dilemma with significant ramifications for public health policy and society. A study published in The Lancet projects that India's fertility rate would fall to 1.29 by 2050. The TFR below the replacement level of 2.1, which characterizes this demographic change, suggests that, in the absence of immigration, the average number of children per woman is insufficient to sustain the current population size. Public health strategies must change to accommodate an ageing population and a possibly reduced workforce. These changes may call for increased funding regarding the treatments for higher fertility rates. 2 /5 At The Same Time, Society's Dynamics Will Change There might be a shift toward automation and a need for older workers to reskill as fewer young people enter the job. The traditional assumptions that women should be the primary caregivers may change in reaction to changing family structures and economic challenges, which could impact gender roles. Also Read - Can You Get Arsenic Poisoning From Brown Rice? 3 /5 Within The Framework Of These Demographic Shifts Reproductive technology developments like egg freezing provide personalized answers to infertility problems. Egg freezing is becoming more popular in India, but slowly, because of social conventions, the need for increased awareness, and the difficulty in accessing services. Egg freezing is an advantageous development in reproductive liberty for individuals who are at risk of infertility as a result of medical treatments or who are just not ready to have children yet. 4 /5 Reproductive Technologies They offer possibilities but are not a cure-all for the general population trends. Public health policies need to be more comprehensive and should consider socioeconomic factors such as urbanization, education, and women's empowerment, which contribute to the reduction in fertility. Even the cultural perceptions of parenthood and family size change with evolving economic realities and values. Also Read - Home Remedies To Cure Bloating: 5 Ayurvedic Herbs for Instant Stomach Gas Relief 5 /5 To Address The Issues Mentioned Earlier A diverse approach can be taken. Educational programs about fertility preservation can be used to eliminate any misunderstandings about egg freezing.

    "article_content": "Written by Editorial Team | Updated : April 28, 2022 11:07 AM IST Summer, like all the other seasons, has its unique personality. Summer may boost your internal sense of harmony or intensify one of your natural tendencies, depending on your constitution. A hot-natured person who enjoys a cool climate, for example, may enjoy the winter but will feel hotter than most to the point of discomfort as the summer heat intensifies. Eating different foods has certain effects on the body. Thus, there are suggestions on how to eat in summer, according to Ayurveda. Summer is the Pitta season - when the fire and water elements of the Pitta Dosha reign. Pitta is one of the three Ayurvedic Doshas or qualities, and each person's constitution consists of all three, though one quality usually dominates. Pitta can go out of balance in hot weather, causing skin discomfort, indigestion, nausea, and frustration. What we eat can aggravate or relieve Pitta. Thus, it is essential to know how to eat in summer. Cooling foods, according to Ayurveda, are not always colder in temperature but rather have cooling energy. In summer, our bodies tend to crave light food and small meals that are easier to digest because the Agni (digestive fire), a powerful source of internal heat, disperses in the summer to help keep us cool. Overeating should be avoided by being fully present with your meals and relishing the flavour and texture of your food. More News Cool or room temperature water infused with mint or lime and a pinch of raw sugar, a sweet lassi, refreshing herbal teas like peppermint, liquorice, fennel or rose, or an occasional beer are all great ways to beat the heat. Iced drinks should be avoided since they disrupt the digestive process and cause toxins to build up in the body. Except for honey and molasses, all unprocessed sweeteners are cooling and can be consumed in moderation during the hot months. Also, raw veggies (such as those found in salads) get digested better if eaten at lunch rather than dinner. var firstScrolled3 = false; window.addEventListener(\"scroll\",(event) => { if(!firstScrolled3) { window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-m\", container: \"taboola-mid-article-thumbnails\", placement: \"Mid Article Thumbnails\", target_type: \"mix\" }); firstScrolled3 = true; } }); Sour or unripe fruits, aged cheeses, and hot vegetables and spices including carrots, beets, radishes, onions, garlic, ginger, and mustard seeds should be avoided. Avoid meals that are excessively hot, such as chillies or cayenne pepper. Summer is the best time to devour sweet, bitter, and astringent flavours, as well as, cool, watery, and slightly oily dishes. The ideal time of year to eat fresh fruits and salads is summer. It's also a fantastic time to enjoy sweet dairy products like milk, butter, ghee, cottage cheese, fresh handmade yoghurt, and, on rare occasions, ice cream. Fruits such as apples, berries, cherries, coconut, grapes, limes, mangoes, melons, pears, pineapples, plums, and pomegranates should be consumed during summer. Beet Greens, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, cucumbers, green beans, lettuce, okra, potatoes, and zucchini are some vegetables that are beneficial during the season. Favourable grains for summer are Barley, rice, Basmati, and wheat. The article has been contributed by Dr. Gaurav Tripathi, Ayurveda and Nutrition Expert, Birla Ayurveda.

    "article_content": "Written by Arushi Bidhuri | Published : May 29, 2022 4:00 PM IST 1 /7 Avoid Eating These Foods This Summer Gone are the days when summer used to feel fresh! Now it's the harsh summer days with 49-degree Celsius temperature that will make you want to stay indoors. And being dehydrated can make things worse during the summer season. While it's important to drink plenty of water to keep yourself hydrated, avoiding certain foods that can make you feel dehydrated is also vital. Here are the foods that you should avoid eating in summer. 2 /7 Salty Foods High-sodium foods are not good for your system! They can also make you feel dehydrated. When you consume a lot of sodium, it can push your body and kidneys out of whack. The body will extract water from your cells during this time. Drinking more water will help to neutralise salt and refresh your body's cells. Too much sodium may be to blame if you're thirsty, queasy, or have diarrhoea or stomach cramps. Also Read - Can Meningioma Be Treated With Radiation Therapy? 3 /7 High Protein Foods While high protein foods are a great way to lose weight, there’s a downside! A high protein diet could also lead to dehydration. Amino acids, which make up protein, include nitrogen. When you eat a lot of protein, your body uses fluids and water to flush out the excess nitrogen. Make sure that you keep yourself hydrated by drinking a lot of water if you are on a high protein diet. 4 /7 Sugary Treats It’s not just salt that can dehydrate the body, sugar can have the same impact. The reason: the kidneys will try to compensate for the fact that sugar isn't supposed to be in the blood by pulling fluid out through urination. Sugary soft drinks are the worst drinks because of their high sugar content.

It causes your body to drain fluids from your blood at a significantly faster rate than other liquids through your renal system, which comprises your kidneys, ureters, and bladder. You can easily become dehydrated if you don't drink enough water when drinking alcohol. You may notice that your body flushes out yellow pee after consuming a lot of alcohol, which is an indication of dehydration. 6 /7 Caffeine Oh, the beloved caffeinated drinks! Hate to break it to you, but coffee or tea is not the best beverage during the sweltering weather. The caffeine content in tea can affect your body, leading to dehydration. If you cannot do without it, try to drink only one cup a day to avoid problems.

Almost all the countries have experienced record high temperatures this year which makes climate change the obvious reasons behind it. India, on the other hand has crossed 50 degree Celsius this year making the weather unbearable for the people.

According to a report by the news Agency AFP in India, more than 6000 people have succumbed to heatwaves in the last 1o years. The World Health Organisation (WHO) also stressed on the fact that yearly deaths due to climate change especially due to heat stress is due to increase in the near future.

    "article_content": "Written by Editorial Team | Updated : March 21, 2022 10:40 AM IST Sleep is a physiological state of rest with reduced consciousness and a temporary disconnect from the outer world. The organs maintain optimum functions during sleep and brain cells undergo special functions of sorting out their activities. Proper sleep at night ensures effective engagement during the day. According to the American Association of Sleep Medicine, an adult undergoes a cyclical rhythm of sleep called NREM - Non-rapid Eye Movement and REM - Rapid Eye Movement sleep. REM sleep occurs 90 minutes after NREM and is less in duration during the early part of the night. This slowly becomes longer during the later part in the early morning hours. REM sleep helps in sorting out and digesting the sensory impressions and information perceived during the day. More News NREM sleep occurs in three stages going from light sleep to deep sleep. It is during this phase that growth, repair and rejuvenation of tissues take place. Children are open sensory beings and take in a lot of sensory impressions. They need to sleep for a longer duration and get adequate sleep cycles with longer REM phases. This helps them in digesting various sensory impressions to create more space for fresh inputs. Babies in the first few months sleep for 16 to 18 hours. This favours transitions, adaptations, rapid growth and development of the child. The duration of sleep reduces to 9-10 hours per night until the teenage years. Then it further gets reduced to an average of 6-8 hours for adults. As one gets older, the sleep duration becomes shorter. So as one age, the quality of sleep matters to maintain a good connection with the inner and the outer world. Quality in sleep comes from the cyclical rhythm of the REM phase, which occurs only after deep sleep. var firstScrolled3 = false; window.addEventListener(\"scroll\",(event) => { if(!firstScrolled3) { window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-m\", container: \"taboola-mid-article-thumbnails\", placement: \"Mid Article Thumbnails\", target_type: \"mix\" }); firstScrolled3 = true; } }); Physical level : Balanced nutrition, early dinner by 7 PM, adequate physical activities and routine sleep time. Avoid stimulants such as coffee or tea before bedtime. Emotional level : Healthy expressions of emotions through art and craft help free emotional baggage. Before going to sleep, take stock of the day - reviewing the day objectively as a third person going through events from start till the end of the day. Mental level : Avoid media inputs and mind stimulating activities after 8 PM. Light reading, listening to soothing music, preferably instrumental helps to unwind from the day. Yoga Nidra, if done regularly, helps in improving the quality of sleep. Breathing exercises with a focus on exhalation strengthen the parasympathetic nervous system activity, which is rest and relaxation, thereby facilitating better sleep quality. For those who have difficulty falling asleep despite a good lifestyle, external therapy such as gentle foot massages with lavender oil and warm foot baths before retiring to bed will help in getting better sleep . It is not the quantity of sleep that matters but the quality of sleep which helps in maintaining health.

It's about recognizing the fundamental role that good nutrition and quality sleep play in shaping the performance of individuals within organizations. Let's delve into how these two pillars of wellness, food and sleep, intersect to create a conducive environment for peak performance in the workplace. The connection between nutrition, sleep, and productivity is profound yet often overlooked. Employees who fuel their bodies with nutritious food and prioritize sufficient sleep experience improvements in their physical health and a significant boost in their cognitive function and overall productivity.

As leaders in employee wellness, we must recognize the profound impact of nutrition and sleep on productivity.

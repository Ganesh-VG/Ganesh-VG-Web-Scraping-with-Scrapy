    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Delhi Police has added the IPC section for \"disappearing evidence and giving false information\" against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's aide Bibhav Kumar in AAP MP Swati Maliwal's assault case, an official said on Monday. Kumar is accused of assaulting Maliwal at the chief minister's official residence on May 13. The official said Section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was added in the case. Section 201 carries a provision for imprisonment of one-sixth of the punishment awarded for the biggest offence in the crime, he added. The FIR against Kumar was registered on May 16 under provisions of the IPC such as those related to criminal intimidation, assault or criminal force on a woman with the intent to disrobe, and attempt to commit culpable homicide. Maliwal, a former chief of the Delhi Commission for Women, alleged that Kumar attacked her with full force, slapped and kicked her when she had gone to meet Kejriwal. According to a senior police officer, Kumar's mobile phone was found to have been formatted when he was arrested from Kejriwal's residence on May 18. He was in Mumbai before returning to Delhi. The police took Kumar to Mumbai twice. He is suspected to have formatted his mobile phone in Mumbai but did not disclose the place where he formatted it or the person with whom he shared the data, the officer said. During his police custody, Kumar did not cooperate in the investigation, he added. Another police officer said three CCTV DVRs (digital video recorders) were collected from Kejriwal's residence -- two from cameras installed at the entrance and one outside the drawing room. The DVRs were sent to the forensic science laboratory as it was suspected that these were tampered with. The reports were awaited, he said. Kumar was arrested on May 18 and is currently lodged in Tihar jail."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Legendary West Indies fast bowler Sir Curtly Ambrose has put star India batter Virat Kohli in the same bracket as Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting. Notably, Kohli is often compared with Tendulkar to be the greatest batter to play for the country as he’s closing in on his world record of most international hundreds. Kohli currently has 80 international centuries to his name and is just 20 hundreds behind Tendulkar’s record of 100 international centuries. The 35-year-old recently broke Tendulkar’s record of most ODI hundreds (49) as he registered his 50 th century against New Zealand in the ODI World Cup 2023 semi-final. With Kohli closing on breaking his idol record, Curtly Ambrose refrained from comparing the two legendary cricketers as he feels that players from different eras can’t be compared. However, he mentioned that Kohli would’ve dominated any era which makes him a great player like Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats “Virat Kohli, the great man, someone who I admire as well, I love watching him. Don’t ask me to compare them (Sachin and Virat). I think, I don’t think I know he’s a great player and how I judge players because people like to compare different eras. I don’t particularly like to do those things,” said Ambrose in an interview with Sports Tak. “But what I can say is when I look at great batsmen, how I judge them. Like presently Virat Kohli, he’s dominating today’s cricket, my question to myself is would he have done well during my era or before my era? I believe he would and because of that that’s why I give him great. Sachin Tendulkar is the same thing, Ricky Ponting and these guys are great players because they can dominate any era,” he added. Meanwhile, Kohli hasn’t been in the best of forms in the ongoing T20 World Cup having scored just 66 runs from five innings at an average of 13.20 and a strike rate of 108.19. The former India captain is opening the innings in the ongoing event alongside captain Rohit Sharma but has failed to notch up a big score. However, the star batter is slowly finding form as he scored 24 (24) and 37 (28) in the last two innings after scoring just five runs in the first three innings of the tournament. With the tournament heading towards the knockout stages, India will hope Kohli to finally find his form as they take on Australia in their last Super 8 clash on Monday, June 24 at Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, Gros Islet, St Lucia."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Despite a greater push for women’s participation in electoral politics, of the total elected members in the 18th Lok Sabha, 13.6 per cent or 74 MPs were women. This falls considerably short of the 33 per cent quota that will be designated for women under the Women's Reservation Act, 2023, following a delimitation exercise. While, over time, women have increased in the Lok Sabha, this growth has been unsteady. India Today's Data Intelligence Unit analysed data on women's representation in the Lok Sabha from 1957 to 2024 and women's voter turnout from 1962 to 2024 and found a mix of trends. WOMEN LEGISLATORS INCREASING? In 1957, 5.4 per cent of Parliament were women, rising to 6.7 per cent in 1962, but then dropping to 5.9 per cent in 1967. Representation remained relatively low throughout the 1970s and 1980s, ranging from 3.4 per cent in 1977 to 8.1 per cent in 1984-85. After that, generally, more women were elected. By 2019, women made up 14.4 per cent of the Lok Sabha. However, this dropped to 13.6 per cent in 2024. WHAT IS THE SUCCESS RATE? In 1957, 22 out of 45 women candidates won, a success rate of 48.9 per cent. However, overall, the success rate of women declined over time. In 2024, only 9.3 per cent of women who contested elections won seats in the Lok Sabha. NEW FACES Of the 74 new women MPs, 43 are first-time lawmakers like Misa Bharti of the Rashtriya Janata Dal and Kangana Ranaut of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Several young female candidates between the ages of 25 and 30 also secured seats in the Lok Sabha, including Congress’ Sanjna Jatav from Bharatpur in Rajasthan and Priyanka Jarkiholi from Chikkodi in Karnataka, Shambhavi Choudhary of the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) from Samastipur in Bihar, and the Samajwadi Party’s Iqra Choudhary and Priya Saroj from Kairana and Machhlishahr in Uttar Pradesh. WHICH PARTY HAD MORE WOMEN MPS? In 2024, women MPs in the Lok Sabha represent 14 different parties. The BJP has the most at 31, followed by the Congress at 13. The All India Trinamool Congress has 11 women MPs, the SP has five, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has three, and the LJPRV and the Janata Dal (United) have two each. Seven other parties have one woman MP each. TURNOUT GAP NARROWED? In 1962, men's turnout was 63.3 per cent, while women's turnout was much lower at 46.6 per cent. This gap fluctuated over the years but generally decreased. In 2019, men's turnout was 67.01 per cent, and women's turnout was slightly higher at 67.18 per cent. But in 2024, men's turnout increased again to 65.8 per cent, while women's turnout remained almost the same at 65.78 per cent. STATE WITH THE HIGHEST VOTER TURNOUT In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, several states and Union Territories witnessed notably high turnout among women voters. We analysed only the states which have at least five parliamentary constituencies. Assam, with its 14 parliamentary constituencies, had the highest female voter turnout of 81.71 per cent. Andhra Pradesh, comprising 25 parliamentary constituencies, saw a robust women’s turnout of 80.3 per cent. West Bengal with 42 parliamentary constituencies was at 80.18 per cent. Odisha had the fourth-highest women’s turnout of 75.55 per cent. Even Chhattisgarh, with only 11 Parliamentary Constituencies, saw women’s active engagement with a turnout of 72.23 per cent."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Ever since Trinamool Congress (TMC) Rajya Sabha MP Saket Gokhale took to his X social media handle on June 11 to declare that three of the newly-elected BJP MPs from West Bengal were in touch with his party, a series of interesting events have unfolded in the state. On June 18, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee met the BJP’s Rajya Sabha member Ananta Burman Maharaj aka Nagendra Roy at his residence in Coochbehar. Roy has been a vocal advocate of separate statehood for his community, but had extended support to the BJP camp ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, resulting in the victory of their candidate Nisith Pramanik. Pramanik was later inducted as a junior home minister under Amit Shah at the Centre. Roy himself was awarded with a Rajya Sabha berth last August—against the suggestions of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and many state unit leaders. In this Lok Sabha election, however, the TMC wrested the Coochbehar seat, and sources claim that Roy might have a hand in the results. Soon after his induction into the Rajya Sabha, Roy fell out with the BJP leadership. He publicly said he is not being given enough importance in the party. He alleged he was kept in the dark about the party’s activities and was not invited to crucial meetings. There were inner rumblings between Roy and Pramanik as to who will be more powerful in the politics of Coochbehar district. Shah himself had to intervene and call Roy to snub his ‘protests’. It is being said that since then, Roy has gradually stopped rallying behind Pramanik, though not publicly, leading to the latter’s defeat. “I do not belong to any party. I have not contacted the TMC or Mamata Banerjee. She called upon me as a courtesy visit,” Roy said after Mamata left. Sources said the chief minister congratulated the self-proclaimed Maharaj for his role in the polls. It was also reported that Roy complained that he is not being able to use his MP development funds due to administrative non-cooperation—a matter Mamata apparently promised to look into. On the other hand, the recent activities of the BJP’s Bishnupur MP Saumitra Khan have brought the spotlight on him as well. Recently, Khan was seen touching the feet of a local TMC leader as a show of respect. When asked, Khan told INDIA TODAY this was his ‘brand of politics’. “I am a three-time MP from Bishnupur. I maintain good relations with everyone, cutting across party lines, and this is why everyone love me,” he said. Khan won the 2024 Lok Sabha polls by a marginal lead of 5,567, defeating estranged wife and TMC candidate Sujata Mondal. He has lately been vocal about the poll debacle faced by the BJP. While holding organisational inabilities and sabotage as responsible for the results, he also heaped praises on TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee. Khan has said he will demand the payment of central dues towards Bengal under the NREGA and PMAY-G schemes. The cessation of these funds became a major poll plank for the TMC in the general elections. Khan believes the non-payment precipitated the BJP’s poll inundation. “I am not joining the TMC. The BJP has given me a lot, and I respect that,” Khan, however, clarified. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Floodwaters forced people out of their homes in parts of Iowa, the result of weeks of rain, while much of the US longed for relief on Saturday from yet another round of extraordinary heat. Sirens blared at 2 am in Rock Valley, Iowa, with a population of 4,200, where people in hundreds of homes were told to get out as the Rock River could no longer take the rain that had slammed the region. The city lacked running water because wells were unusable. Mayor Kevin Van Otterloo said a state helicopter was on its way to help but was called off when boats were able to reach stranded residents. “We’ve had so much rain here,” he said. “We had four inches last night in an hour and a half. Our ground just cannot take anymore.” Governor Kim Reynolds declared a disaster for 21 counties in northern Iowa, including Sioux County, which includes Rock Valley. In a drone video posted by the local sheriff, no streets were visible, just roofs and treetops poking above the water. In South Dakota, Gov. Kristi Noem declared an emergency after the southeastern part of the state received heavy rainfall. The town of Canton, 48 kilometres southeast of Sioux Falls, has received 18 inches of rain. Several highways were closed, including a key stretch of Interstate 29 south of Sioux Falls that later reopened. Sioux Falls, the state’s largest city, had more than seven inches of rain in three days. “Even though the rain is slowing down, we need to keep vigilant,” said Noem. “The worst of the flooding along our rivers will be Monday and Tuesday.” Elsewhere in the US, the miserable grip of heat and humidity continued. The National Weather Service said roughly 15 million people were under a heat warning — the highest level of alert — while another 90 million were under a heat advisory. Millions across the country have had their lives disrupted by stretches of unusually high temperatures. Last year, the US experienced the most heatwaves since 1936, experts said. An AP analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that excessive heat contributed to more than 2,300 deaths, the highest in 45 years of records. Temperatures around 37.8 degrees Celsius were predicted for Washington, DC, and Richmond, Virginia, while Philadelphia; Newark, New Jersey; Columbus, Ohio; and Detroit were bracing for temperatures above 32 degrees Celsius. Heat-related hospital visits in New York state lately were 500 per cent higher than on the average June day, according to the Department of Health. “We still have this prolonged heat wave across portions of the Ohio Valley and into the Northeast,” weather service meteorologist Marc Chenard said. “We get a little bit of relief by early in the week, at least in the eastern US, the Northeast, but in general above-normal temperatures are going to cover a large portion of the country even into next week.” In southeastern Michigan, DTE Energy said 7,400 customers remained without power as of Saturday afternoon due to storm-related outages, down from 75,000 earlier in the week. A heat index of 37.8 Celsius didn’t stop Florida couple Judy and Bill Watson from watching the Tigers play the White Sox at Detroit’s Comerica Park. Their afternoon visit was a milestone: Bill Watson has now seen games at all 30 MLB ballparks. “We’re from Florida. You might be interviewing the wrong people about heat,” the 71-year-old Bradenton man said with a smile. “We drank water and beer occasionally. We were just happy it didn’t get rained out.” Across the country in California, temperatures in the state’s Central Valley were expected to reach as high as 41.1 Celsius, and the NWS issued a heat advisory through 8 pm. Nearly 4,000 homes and businesses in Sacramento lost power for less than an hour in the middle of the day, the Sacramento Bee reported. In Iowa, power was cut off at wastewater treatment plants in Hawarden and Spencer, which together have 14,000 residents. Aiden Engelkes said he and his girlfriend grabbed clothes, cats and bottled water and left their flooded first-floor apartment in Spencer for a friend’s dry space on the fourth floor. His Chevy SUV was under the roiling water outside, except for a bit of its antenna. Across the street, he said, friends were on a roof waiting for help. “It’s terrifying,” said Engelkes, 20. While the chances for rain were forecast as small into the middle of next week, the National Weather Service predicted expanded flooding before then in the area as high water moved downstream on several rivers in northern Iowa. Flooding also closed state highways and county roads in southern Minnesota. Windom, a town of about 4,800 people, received 1.25 inches of rain on top of earlier heavy downpours, and the Des Moines River there had a record crest. “We’re having a tough time just keeping up, putting up barricades,” city council member Jenny Quaid said. “We put barricades up, and then all of a sudden, the water’s rising so much, the barricade’s way back in the water.” In New Mexico, heavy rain and flash flood warnings prompted officials to order some evacuations, with shelters set up for displaced residents. The NWS announced a flash flood emergency on Friday night through early Saturday. The impacted areas included the city of Las Vegas, New Mexico, and communities near Albuquerque. In Ruidoso, a mountain village in New Mexico, full-time residents will be allowed to return Monday after they were forced out by wildfires, though everyday life won’t return to normal. “You’re going to need to bring a week’s worth of food, you’re going to need to bring drinking water,” Mayor Lynn Crawford said on Facebook."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A day after Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge’s open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking to enlighten him about the party’s manifesto, the BJP has clapped back by digging up a video of former PM Manmohan Singh and what he said about minorities being entitled to preferential treatment. According to the BJP, in a video from April 2009, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, \"Minorities, particularly Muslim minorities, if they are poor, have prior claim to the resources of the nation.\" April 2009: In the run up to Lok Sabha election, Dr Manmohan Singh, reiterated his statement that minorities, especially poor Muslims, should get priority when it comes to the nation’s resources. He categorically stated that he stood by his earlier assertion that Muslims shouldâæ pic.twitter.com/sNTYa5WSfM — BJP (@BJP4India) April 26, 2024 Latching on to Singh’s remark, the BJP used it as fresh ammunition against the Congress amid the ongoing row over its alleged \"wealth redistribution plan\". PM Modi had touched off the controversy when he said at a poll rally that the Congress had promised to snatch away the people's hard-earned money and redistribute it to \"infiltrators\" and those \"who have many children\". \"In the run up to Lok Sabha election, Dr Manmohan Singh, reiterated his statement that minorities, especially poor Muslims, should get priority when it comes to the nation’s resources. He categorically stated that he stood by his earlier assertion that Muslims should have first right when it comes to resources,\" the BJP said in a caption to the video. The saffron party stated that Manmohan Singh's past remarks bolster its claims that the Congress has a policy of giving preferential treatment to the Muslim community. \"This unequivocal assertion by Dr Manmohan Singh demolishes the Congress’ canards and clarifications on his previous statement...This is further proof of the Congress mindset to give preference to Muslims in everything, from reservation to resources,\" the BJP alleged. This line of attack by the BJP came after Mallikarjun Kharge wrote to PM Modi, claiming that he was being misinformed by his advisors about things that are not mentioned in the Congress 'Nyay Patra' or manifesto. In his two-page letter, Kharge sought time from the Prime Minister to meet him in person and \"explain our Nyay Patra so that as the Prime Minister you don’t make statements that are false\". PM Modi had alleged that when the Congress was in power under Manmohan Singh, it said Muslims have the first right to the country's wealth. \"This means that they will gather this property and distribute it among people who have more children, among infiltrators. Will your hard-earned money be given to infiltrators? Do you accept this? The Congress manifesto is saying this,\" the PM had said. The Congress has denied these allegations and said their manifesto had no such promise. Its manifesto says that if elected, the party will conduct a nationwide socio-economic and caste census. The Prime Minister, however, has doubled down, repeating his charge in rally after rally."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A violent clash broke out between security guards and residents of a Gurugram society. The altercation, which involved the use of sticks and rods, was triggered by a dispute over drinking alcohol within the society premises. The incident took place at ROF Ananda Society in Sector 95, Gurugram, at around 11 pm on Thursday. The clash was captured on video. The conflict began when some residents were consuming alcohol in the complex. A security guard on duty objected to their drinking, leading to a heated argument and subsequent physical confrontation. The residents, angered by the guard's interference, allegedly started assaulting him. In response, the security guard called the Quick Response Team (QRT). Upon arrival, the QRT clashed with the residents and used sticks on them. The video of the incident shows a chaotic scene with both security personnel and residents striking each other. At one point, a member of the QRT steps out of the vehicle and starts hitting the residents who were assaulting the guard. The fight escalates further when one resident throws a brick at a security guard. As the situation intensified, the security guards attempted to escape. One managed to get out of the gate, while another got into a vehicle. In the process, a motorcyclist was hit as the security guard reversed his vehicle. When the security guard in the vehicle tried to drive away, residents closed the gate, but he sped through, breaking the gate. The police are thoroughly investigating the entire matter and CCTV footage is being reviewed as part of the ongoing investigation. In a telephonic conversation with India Today TV, Pradeep, the in-charge of Sector 93 police outpost, said that the complaint was received on Friday morning. Initial investigations revealed that residents were drinking alcohol in the society, which led to the altercation when the security guard tried to stop them, he said."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 7 Jun, 2024 TVF series 'Gullak' returns with its fourth season, delivering its trademark warmth and slice-of-life moments. Retaining its signature charm and relatable humour, the show once again immerses viewers into the endearing Mishra family's world, narrated through the unique perspective of a gullak (voiced by Shivankit Parihar). While the trailer hinted at focussing on Aman (Harsh Mayar), the youngest Mishra, Season 4 is as much a story of Aman as it is of Annu (Vaibhav Raj Gupta), Shanti (Geetanjali Kulkarni), and Santosh Mishra (Jameel Khan). As the youngest son navigates the challenges of adulthood, tensions rise within the family, leading them to unexpected situations, including a visit to the police station. This time it is adulting vs parenting with an adulting kid trying to be a rebel without a cause. And, Santosh Mishra, a rather cool dad, finds himself losing his cool. Annu, the eldest Mishra son has matured and is now an MR (medical representative). Meanwhile, tension brews between the once inseparable siblings - Annu bhaiya and his younger brother Aman. Amongst all this, Shanti Mishra, the matriarch of the family, keeps them together but not without her onslaught of words, as the Gullak calls it - inki rukhi si roti jaise jeevan mein jaise nimbu ka achaar hai Shanti Mishra ke maukhik prahaar (In their life, Shanti Mishra's verbal attacks add the much-needed tanginess). Created and directed by Shreyansh Pandey, in Gullak Season 4, the Mishras will once again win your hearts with their own brand of endearing quirks and relatable struggles. This time the five-episode series is written by Vidit Tripathi. Amidst these new challenges, the essence of 'Gullak's' charm remains intact, capturing the essence of middle-class life with humour and heart. As the Gullak says ' Middle-class woh hai jo chhine hue gold chain ko bhi purkho ki narak mukti ka daan samjhe (Middle class people are those who consider that the gold chain that was stolen will redeem their ancestors in hell from their sins). Matlad bure se bure situation mein kuch achhayi dhoondh hi lenge hum middle class . In short, we middle-class people can find goodness even in the worst of situations. The USP of 'Gullak' has been the strong performances and crackling chemistry of the cast. Be it Aman and Annu or Bittu ki Mummy and Mishra family - their camaraderie is unmatched. Once again, the cast delivers stellar performances, with Geetanjali Kulkarni and Jameel Khan shining as the bickering yet loving parents. Vaibhav Raj Gupta gives 'bade bhaiya' vibes as the angry young man who tries to dictate terms when he orders Aman not to bolt the door. He also steps in as a loving big brother when the younger sibling needs him. He embodies the role of the older brother with ease, while Harsh Mayar brings depth to the character of Aman, perfectly capturing the nuances of young adulthood. Sunita Rajwar, as always, is brilliant as the nosy Bittu ki Mummy, who always lands up at the Mishra house at odd times. Helly Shah is a refreshing addition to the cast of 'Gullak' as Dr. Preeti, and her inclusion seems to mark the beginning of a love story in the series. As always, 'Gullak' excels at portraying the simple joys and frustrations of everyday life, with sharp wit and relatable situations that resonate with viewers. While maintaining its humour, Season 4 strikes the perfect balance between drama and humour, ensuring a delightful viewing experience for fans old and new. If you are among those who get teary-eyed during emotional sequences, keep those tissues ready for the last episode. Annu Bhaiya ne toh dil jeet liya. After 'Panchayat' Season 3, 'Gullak' Season 4 is yet another gem from the TVF factory, known for its realistic storytelling. If you are a loyal Gullak fan, go watch the series now. And for those who haven't been introduced to the show yet, the Mishra family with their innumerable anecdotes won't disappoint. 4 out of 5 stars for 'Gullak' Season 4."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story India are set to renew their rivalry against Australia in an ICC tournament on Monday, 24 June. India are set to play the 2021 champions in their final Super 8 clash of the T20 World Cup 2024. India come into the game unbeaten, courtesy of their superb bowling performance throughout the tournament. Fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah has been the star of the show from the very start, scalping 10 wickets at a ridiculous economy of 3.42 runs per over. Speaking about the clash on Star Sports, Piyush Chawla and Paul Collingwood unanimously agreed that Jasprit Bumrah could turn out to be the difference maker in the India vs Australia clash given the superb form that he had been in throughout the tournament. The former England captain - Collingwood - said that Bumrah could put the Australian openers in real trouble in Monday's clash. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats \"Jasprit Bumrah is the big point of difference in this World Cup. He is the person who would be on any team sheet. He is somebody who can take a lot of wickets. And I think when you've got a player like that in your rank and bowl four overs; I think Australia are probably in a little bit of trouble. I can imagine that he would be putting them under a serious amount of pressure, but it's going to be a great one to watch,\" Paul Collingwood said on Star Sports. Former India spinner Chawla stressed on Bumrah's ability to use the pitch extremely well and his knack for reading the conditions. \"Whenever he steps onto the field, he brings his A-game out. And we have seen what he can do with the ball surface doesn't matter for him because we have seen what he has done in the US where the wickets were seaming around and when we came to the Caribbean, the way he bowled, he used the pitch really well with the good effect. He used his cutters and then his pace-on deliveries and he's somebody who can bowl yorkers at will. But he knows when there is something in the pitch for the bowler and he didn't even try to use those yorkers against Bangladesh. Those four overs are very, very crucial,\" Chawla said while speaking on the same panel. Australia come into their last Super 8 game after a shock loss against Afghanistan . Australia have to beat India to stay alive in the competition."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Head coach Jonathan Trott said that Afghanistan need to improve in the batting department ahead of their crucial Super 8 clash against Bangladesh in the T20 World Cup 2024. The Afghans will be brimming with confidence after beating Australia by 21 runs, but Trott said that their batting was not up to the mark. Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran put on 118 runs for the opening wicket off 15.5 overs. But from there on, the Afghans could only score 30 runs off 25 balls. Pat Cummins picked up a hat-trick and did not let Afghanistan batters unleash their power-hitting in the death overs. Thereafter, Gulbadin Naib and Naveen-ul-Haq picked up 4 and 3 wickets respectively, as the Afghans bowled the Aussies out for 127 in 19.2 overs . “I think the skill was the partnership that we had, the platform that we had, and then that enabled us to accelerate a little bit. I still don't think we batted all that well towards the end of the innings. We left a lot of runs out there, and that's something we need to work on and get better at,” Trott said in the pre-match press conference. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats With their win against Australia, Afghanistan are now in with a genuine chance of advancing to the semis. Their contest against the Tigers will be the last Super 8 clash and Trott feels that it could be advantage for the Afghans. Trott said that Afghanistan would be aware of their requirements after the end of the Super 8 match between India and Australia. “Certainly, when you have that type of platform, you need to be able to capitalize with the amount of wickets in hand that we had. So, looking forward to the Bangladesh game, that's going to be key and how we play that. So, that's always a nice thing, having played at the venue and on the same pitch that we're playing on against Bangladesh and having a little bit of knowledge,” Trott added. Afghanistan have a 5-4 record against Bangladesh in T20Is. But at neutral venues, they have won all 4 of their matches against the Tigers."

The US side were the surprise package of the tournament this year as they came out looking strong from Group A, which consisted of both India and Pakistan. They went on to shock Pakistan and pushed India to the limit to qualify for the Super 8s. However, they were unable to maintain their form and exited the competition with 3 straight losses. The last one was a humbling at the hands of England on Sunday . Anderson, speaking at the press conference, said that the team was hurt by the loss but feels that the feeling is a good sign which shows they can do much more. \"Look, they're disappointed. They're hurt. I'm hurt. Your pride's always on the line when you're playing these games and you never want to lose badly or have performances like that. But again, it's looking at the bigger picture of it too. If we're a team and we first started and we're beginning to be disappointed about how we play against these big teams and knowing that we can do better, that's a great sign because it means we can give more,\" said Anderson. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats Anderson feels that despite being seen as an associate nation, there is a lot of talent in the USA and the T20 World Cup was a massive stepping stone for them. The all-rounder feels the team can be proud of their achievements. \"I think the public's perception and expectation of us is probably very much still that we're an Associate nation, and yes, we are. But we've got extremely good talent in the US, and this was a massive stepping stone in showing that. I think the boys can hold their heads high and be proud of what they've done. Because again, I think we've probably turned the world's attention to the US for them to say we're here to play,\" said Anderson. The USA finished at the bottom of Group 2 in the Super 8 stages."

Shamsi lauded the Proteas for fighting till the end throughout the tournament, which ultimately saw them clinch yet another effective close-call result on top of a nail-biting contest with the hosts. With rain coming into play, it was ultimately South Africa who bagged the ever-crucial win against the hosts by 3 wickets via DLS method. Having won the important toss, the Proteas elected to bowl first at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua, in what was always eyed as a knockout after England defeated the USA to turn the T20 World Cup Super 8 Group 2 standing a bit intense. On top of Shamsi's brilliant performance with the ball in his 3/27 spell, South Africa restricted a pretty strong West Indies batting unit to just 135 after 20 overs. The home side started off their turn with the ball in an emphatic fashion after Andre Russell dismissed both South Africa openers Quinton de Kock and Reeza Hendricks in the second over. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats However, just then, we saw rain interrupting play and eventually the match was reduced to 17 overs and the target was set at 123 runs.

Buttler's England outclassed Pakistan by 5 wickets in the big final and the celebrations started right after Ben Stokes hit the winning runs at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground. There were victory chants, dance, fireworks and champagne as England players and their support staff celebrated their historic triumph. Jos Buttler walked up to the presentation ceremony at the MCG and collected the World Cup trophy. Buttler and his teammates posed for the photographers with the trophy and the winners' medal around their necks. As the photo session was about to get over, the England captain reminded Moeen Ali and Jos Buttler about the champagne celebration that was to follow, respecting their faith. Following Buttler's gesture, the two cricketers left the stage and only rejoined their teammates after the champagne celebration was over. Notably, Eoin Morgan had also come up with a similar gesture during England's celebrations after their 2019 World Cup triumph at Lord's, London. This team âäï¸ Checking Mo and Rashid are out the way before using champagne. pic.twitter.com/FxHF6OJX1w — England's Barmy Army (@TheBarmyArmy) November 14, 2022 Buttler was also joined by his children and wife during the celebrations at the MCG. On Monday, Buttler posed with the World Cup trophy at Brighton beach in Melbourne. Buttler led England to T20 World Cup glory in his first major tournament as England captain. The 32-year-old played a key role, giving a rapid start to England in their chase of 138 on a sluggish pitch, hitting a 17-ball 26. Ben Stokes shone with a well-paced 52 not out as England gunned down the target with an over to spare. England are evolving into one of the most consistent white-ball teams, having won the 50-over World Cup in 2019, reached the semi-final at last year's T20 World Cup and won the T20 World Cup in 2022."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan said it's important that India groom more than one of their stars as potential future captains in the lead-up to the T20 World Cup in 2024, stressing the importance of having back-up options. Pathan backed Hardik Pandya as the frontrunner to take over Rohit Sharma in the future as India's T20I captain, but stressed India should look at creating a pool of leaders. Hardik Pandya is all set to lead India in a 3-match T20I series in New Zealand, starting November 18 in the absence of Rohit Sharma who has been rested for the tour. However, there have been several calls made by former cricketers to appoint Hardik as India's full-time captain for T20Is, keeping in mind the next T20 World Cup, which is two years away. Irfan Pathan, however, pointed out that Hardik Pandya has had injury issues in the past and it's ideal to have more than one captaincy candidate in the lead-up to the T20 World Cup in 2024. Rohit Sharma took over from Virat Kohli after the latter stepped down as T20I captain following India's early exit at last year's T20 World Cup. However, Rohit was not able to live up to expectations, failing to lead India to glory in the Asia Cup and the ultimate goal at T20 World Cup 2022. \"I’m not saying that if you change the captain you change the result, if you go like that you’re not going to change the result. And with Hardik Pandya, you need to understand, we all need to understand, that he’s a fast bowling all-rounder. He has injury issues as well. What if he is your captain who is getting injured right before the World cup? And if you don’t have any other leader ready, you’ll be in a mess,\" Irfan said during Star Sports show 'Match Point'. \"So, what I personally think is that Hardik Pandya is a leader, who has done very well in the Gujarat Titians, won IPL, won the championship trophy. You need to find not one, but two leaders going forward to build their mark. You know just like we talk about openers - we need to have a group of openers, we also need to have a group of leaders,\" he added. Furthermore, former West Indies fast bowler Ian Bishop said Rishabh Pant can be a good option to have as a captaincy option, saying he has got the personality. Pant will travel to New Zealand as Hardik's deputy for the T20Is and was also named as the vice-captain of the ODI team, which will be led by Shikhar Dhawan. Pant led India in a 5-match T20I series against South Africa at home after IPL 2022. \"Hardik, I was so impressed with what he did in the IPL. In T20 cricket, successful teams need a risk-taker. Gambler is the wrong word but in keeping with the action format and action captain. So I would say Hardik. I don’t if I have seen enough of Rishabh’s improvement. But he has got personality but if you can make him into one of those, I don’t think it would be a bad idea,\" Bishop said."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Pakistan Cricket Board have sent pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi on a two-week rehabilitation program after he suffered a knee injury in the final of the T20 World Cup. The board breathed a sigh of relief after the scans showed no further injury to his right knee. Shaheen was forced to walk off the pitch after he damaged it while taking the catch of Harry Brook in the finals. He completed the catch, but the forward brace of the right knee hit the ground, and he was seen wincing in pain right away. Pakistan Cricket Board updated the bowler's condition on Monday, 14 November and said that Shaheen's injury was due to a flexion while landing. “Pakistan fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi has been advised two-week rehabilitation after he landed awkwardly while taking Harry Brook’s catch during Sunday’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2022 final in Melbourne,” Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said in a statement. “The scan conducted on Monday morning prior to the team’s departure for Pakistan, has confirmed there were no signs of an injury and the knee discomfort was likely ‘due to a forced knee flexion whilst landing’.” The pacer returned to the T20 World Cup after suffering a long bout of knee injury, which he had suffered while playing a Test match against Sri Lanka earlier this year. The player had gone to London and rehabilitated under Crystal Palace Football Club to fastrack his progress for the world tournament. “Shaheen’s return to international cricket will be subject to the champion fast bowler’s successful completion of the rehabilitation programme and following go-aheads by the medical staff,” the PCB said."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story \"He (Eoin Morgan) had the chance to become the T20 World Cup winning captain but someone blew that up,\" Stokes had the Sky panel in splits after England’s T20 World Cup win. The all-rounder referred to himself, bringing back the memories from 2016 - a time when England had just learnt the ways of modern white ball cricket. The context was important, so was the joke, because England’s T20 World Cup win at the Australian shores had the mark of one monumental individual - Eoin Morgan. Born in Ireland, Morgan plied his trade later with England and rose to fame after the country’s disastrous 2015 ODI World Cup campaign. Morgan shot to fame with his number-crunching, risk-assessing methods that saw a rapid rise of England’s white-ball game. Suddenly, a team that could not beat Sri Lanka, New Zealand, Bangladesh and Australia in the ODI format had reached the finals of the tournament in 2016. Overwhelming favourites to clinch the title even till the final over at Eden Gardens, the dreams fell apart when Ben Stokes was hit for four sixes by Carlos Braithwaite. #OnThisDay in 2016... 6ï¸â£,6ï¸â£,6ï¸â£,6ï¸â£! Carlos Brathwaite! Carlos Brathwaite! REMEMBER THE NAME! History for the West Indies! ðÆ pic.twitter.com/ZgKVWhfpn6 — ICC (@ICC) April 3, 2018 But something stuck with England that night as Morgan wrapped his arms around Stokes’ shoulders, that these boys were here to stay. Speaking after the T20 World Cup 2022, Harbhajan Singh lauded England. The Indian World Cup winner said that Rohit Sharma’s team needed to learn how to play the white ball format from the English side. And why not? Since 2015, here are England’s results in the white-ball format under the captaincy of Eoin Morgan (till 2021) and Jos Buttler. 2016 T20 World Cup - Final 2019 ODI World Cup - Winner 2021 T20 World Cup - Semi-final 2022 T20 World Cup - Winner It is quite possible that this team runs deep once again in the 2023 edition of the ODI World Cup as well, set to be hosted by India. Under the leadership of Eoin Morgan, England found a perfect mechanism. The players were selected to make the team bat as deep as possible, and a bowling unit, diverse enough to attack and control whenever necessary. The brand under Morgan in general was, if you come to bat first, put on a mammoth amount of runs and then defend it as hard as you can. Since Morgan took over, England broke the record for the highest total in a men’s ODI match thrice, once in 2016, next in 2018 and then as recently as 2022. And that essentially became the brand, score a heap of runs and then defend it well. Eoin Morgan comes out to bat. (Courtesy: Reuters) It is said that when batters failed for England, Morgan would go into the dressing room and say that “Don’t worry, you will get the big runs next time.” This gave the team confidence to play fearless cricket, which has brought them their results today. That confidence translated into what Buttler did to Naseem Shah in the final of the T20 World Cup. A post shared by ICC (@icc) After nearly getting edged out by the pacer four times in an over, Buttler proceeded to lap the bowler for a six over fine-leg. “I stood there that Naseem Shah over, play and miss. Play and miss. And [Buttler says] I can’t play him normally, so I will scoop him for a six. Ridiculous! (Laughs),” Stokes could not help but laugh at the situation. A squad cannot remain static and Morgan understood better than most. As a person fascinated by data, Morgan’s ability to come up with multiple plans was exceptional. England, under his era built up a pool of specialised players that could deliver at any given point - but with their own specific style. Take the example of Jofra Archer. While the Indian bowling attack lost their bearings after the injuries to Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja, England had been playing without Jofra Archer - possibly the most threatening bowler in the current era for over a year. With Mark Wood as his replacement, Jofra was not needed. However, thunderstruck when Mark Wood was ruled out due to body stiffness in the semi-final and final match of the 2022 World Cup, and what were the results? A win by 10 wickets vs India and then a 5-wicket victory vs Pakistan. At the heart of it? Chris Jordan, who neither has the fear factor of Wood and Archer, nor does he have the raw talent. England exploited Jordan’s defensive bowling capabilities and attacked with the swing of Sam Curran. The team further did well to bowl Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone to get as many overs out as possible. Against India, that worked, and against Pakistan, Sam Curran stole the show. It is an incredible achievement to win the World Cup, it is possibly even better if you can do it within an year into the captaincy tenure. Buttler’s takeover of the team in 2022 rang alarm bells in terms of combination and selections. The start was rocky and some hard calls were made. Buttler axed Morgan’s trusted lieutenant Jason Roy and brought in the exiled Alex Hales. Stokes speaking to Sky after the win pointed out that one should not take Buttler’s tactical acumen for granted and that he had taken 95 per cent of the decisions correctly in the T20 World Cup campaign. Transitioning is not easy, especially for captains of Eoin Morgan’s stature. However, for the English World Cup-winning captain, his final call became a masterstroke. Morgan letting go of his mantle after playing Ireland, just months away from the World Cup, gave England enough time to think. Make no mistake, the foundation of England’s T20 World Cup win was laid by Eoin Morgan - the Zen Master who could see in the future."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story South Africa captain Aiden Markram has claimed that his side won't be 'brainwashed' by making it to the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup 2024 on June 24, Monday. The Proteas edged past the West Indies in a rain-affected thriller in Antigua to make it to the final of the T20 World Cup for the first time since 2014. The match seemed to be in their hands after they had restricted the hosts for 135 in 20 overs. After rain affected the match after the second over of the run chase, South Africa seemed to be in control before a middle-order implosion almost had them worried in the end. However, the tail order kept their calm and got South Africa home in the final over . Speaking at the post-match presentation, Markram said he felt relieved with the win but admitted his team needs to be more convincing with the bat. The Proteas skipper felt that his side tried to kill the game far too early and hoped they can avoid such tricky situations. WI vs SA, T20 World Cup Highlights \"A lot of relief to get through to the semi-final. Not going to be brain-washed by that. We would have liked to be more convincing with bat in hand. After the rain break, the wicket was playing nicely. Did not get the partnerships to then kill the game. Tried to kill it (the chase) too early. Massive for us and fantastic for the change room but hopefully we can avoid those tricky situations (moving forward),\" said Markram. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats Markram was asked about the areas of improvement and he quickly pointed that the batting needs to focus on making partnerships and should try to time their chase well. \"I thought we bowled really well, assessed conditions and kept them to a sub-par total. Just appreciating and understanding the need to build partnerships. Big fan of trying to kill the game early but tonight, we just did that a little early and a good lesson to learn from today. Hopefully we do not repeat that (mistake),\" said Markram. \"The bowling unit has been firing for us, which has been fantastic. Being more clinical with the bat, understanding when it is time to take it on and when to knock it around.\" Markram was asked if he would prefer any side in the semi-final and said he hasn't been following the rest of the proceedings in the World Cup. The Proteas skipper, however, said his side hasn't played their best cricket yet and need to pull things together for the semi-final. \"Whoever it might be, we have not played our best game of cricket yet, so we will try to put it together for the semi-final,\" said Markram. South Africa will now await to see the result of the India vs Australia and Afghanistan vs Bangladesh matches on June 24 to know their opponent in the semi-final."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Rovman Powell said that shoddy batting led to West Indies’ defeat to South Africa in the T20 World Cup 2024 Super 8 clash. On Monday, the co-hosts failed to advance to the semi-final after losing to the Proteas by 3 wickets (DLS) in a rain-marred contest at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua. After being asked to bat first, all West Indies could manage was 135 for 8. Roston Chase and Kyle Mayers scored 52 and 35 respectively to give their team some sort of respectability. The Caribbean bowlers tried their hearts out and took the match right down to the last over, but failed to go past the finish line . Powell said that losing wickets in clumps did not help the West Indies in setting a formidable target for their opponents to chase down. However, the captain lauded the team for hanging on until the very end. WI vs SA, T20 World Cup Highlights “Credit to the boys for fighting till the end. As a batting group, this is a performance we want to forget, we didn't bat well in the middle overs. We lost wickets in clusters and that always breaks the back of the batting team,” Powell said in the post-match presentation ceremony. After his gritty showing with the bat, Chase also performed exceptionally with the ball. He finished with figures of 3-0-12-0 after getting the wickets of Tristan Stubbs, David Miller and Keshav Maharaj. Although West Indies could not progress, Powell lauded his team for playing well in the last 12 months or so. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats “It was a commendable effort; the boys believed they could defend 135. We haven't won the World Cup or reached the semi-final, but we have played some good cricket in the last 12 months. There is a buzz among the supporters about West Indies cricket again and that is something we take away. We really appreciate the support we have got at various venues and the likes on social media,” Powell added. West Indies took the match to the last over when they needed to defend 5 runs while defending a revised target of 123 in 17 overs. However, Marco Jansen’s 6 down the ground off Obed McCoy did not let them have the last laugh."

This tragic incident has left his family in turmoil. Fayaz Ansari hails from Nagina in Bijnor. 22 years ago, Fayaz Ansari from Mohalla Qazi Sarai in Nagina Tehsil, Bijnor, moved to Mumbai and started his own salon. During this time, Pathan began visiting his salon for makeup. Subsequently, the former all-rounder made Ansari his personal makeup artist, taking him along on international trips. Fayaz Ansari with Irfan Pathan (Courtesy: India Today) Mohammad Ahmed, the cousin of the deceased makeup artist, reported that the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 is currently being played in the USA and West Indies, with the Super 8 matches being held in the West Indies. Pathan, part of the commentary team, is in the West Indies and had taken Ansari along with him. It was informed from the West Indies that on Friday evening, June 21, Ansari drowned in a hotel swimming pool while bathing. This news has left his family devastated.

The character Ranga is from the Malayalam movie Aavesham and played by Fahadh Faasil. The famous 'eda mone' (Hey brother) dialogue of the character had gone viral as the movie became a big hit. Samson was shown in the video released by the BCCI showing the team arriving in St. Lucia for the game . The video's total length is one minute and three seconds and around the 55th second mark, Samson was seen talking in Malayalam and saying the dialogue. \"Eda mone. Happy allae. (Hey brother.

Samson was the second designated wicketkeeper in the squad for the T20 World Cup 2024, after his fine performances in the IPL this year. Samson scored 531 runs in 15 matches as RR went to the playoffs of the IPL 2024 season. However, he is yet to get game time in the tournament, with India going with Rishabh Pant as the wicketkeeper and at No.3 in the batting order. India have also preferred to use Shivam Dube in the middle-order ahead of Samson, which wasn't well-received ahead of the game against Bangladesh. Samson had said earlier that this was the most prepared he has ever been in his career before playing for India. \"This is the most prepared and experienced Sanju Samson can come into a World Cup like this. Many years of lots and lots of failures, with some successes here and there. Life and cricket have taught me everything I needed to know before we came into this crucial tournament, actually. The IPL itself had covered all my mindspace, there was a lot to do and a lot to think about. Being the captain, had a lot on my mind. But, somewhere in my mind I knew that World Cup selections were around, and it was a huge thing,\" Samson said."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Tabraiz Shamsi suggested that Aiden Markram should bowl more often, saying that the South African skipper is much better than a part-time spinner. On Monday, the Proteas went through to the semi-final of the T20 World Cup after beating the West Indies by 3 wickets (DLS) at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua. Markram got the wicket of the dangerous Nicholas Pooran on the very first ball of his spell and eventually finished with figures of 4-0-28-1. Shamsi said that his confidence skyrocketed after Markram led from the front in the bowling department. Shamsi won the Player of the Match award for his spell of 4-0-27-3. WI vs SA, T20 World Cup Highlights “I actually always think that he under-bowls himself as whenever he’s the captain, he bowls less. He is a wonderful bowler and is a lot better than a part-timer. So, it was nice that as a captain he saw that there was something in it for him and he bowled those four overs,” Shamsi said in the post-match press conference. “It was nice to see what he did today. And when you see another spinner taking wickets, it gives you confidence as well,” Shamsi said. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats The 29-year-old Markram has bowled 8 overs in the T20 World Cup 2024 and has picked up 2 wickets at an economy rate of 6.62. Shamsi, who replaced Ottneil Baartman in the playing XI, also said that South Africa put in team efforts and there is no pressure on a single player to step up in a crisis. “That’s one thing nice about our unit. If you look at the squad, there is no individual you can pick and say, ‘hey, this guy is responsible for making this team win’. There is no pressure on any one individual. We just have a lot of match-winners within the squad and on each day, someone finds a way to pull the game towards the team,” Shamsi added. With the win against the West Indies, South Africa finished the Super 8 on top of the points table in Group 2 with 6 points and a net run rate of +0.780."

Powell believes that the missed 2 points would have helped the hosts' run for a semi-final spot in the tournament, specifically with the small point difference between the sides in their Super 8, Group 2. After a rain-budged thrilling contest, the Proteas bagged yet another narrow win against the Powell-led West Indies at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua, which extended their unbeaten run and booked a spot in the semi-final of the T20 World Cup. By winning the toss and opting to bowl first in this knockout clash in Antigua, the Proteas restricted the hosts to just 135 runs after 20 overs, on top of Tabraiz Shamsi's brilliant bowling performance in his 3/27 spell. The home side started off their turn with the ball in an emphatic fashion after Andre Russell dismissed both South Africa openers Quinton de Kock and Reeza Hendricks in the second over. However, a rain interruption then saw the game get reduced to 17 overs and the target was set at 123 runs. After impressing with the bat, West Indies all-rounder Roston Chase showcased an equally impressive performance with the ball in his 3/12 spell. Unfortunately for the hosts, that was not enough to take the home side beyond the rope after Marco Jansen and Kagiso Rabada took the Proteas to a win in the final over.

It was a wake-up call because we were consistently playing good cricket, so it showed us that - Hey! in T20 cricket, anything is possible. Looking back now in hindsight, the two points against England were very, very important, because we saw how the group came down. Having said that, we knew that each and every game in Super 8 was going to be tough, it was always important,\" Powell said. After this thrilling win, South Africa will now wait for the confirmation of their semi-finals opponents from Group 1, which will be decided between India, Australia and Afghanistan on the basis of the results from the clash between the former two sides on June 24 evening."

The match will take place on Monday, June 24 (Tuesday, June 25) at the Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown, St Vincent. Both teams are still in the race for a berth in the Super 8. The Afghans will be high on confidence after they defeated Australia by 21 runs . However, head coach Jonathan Trott said that they need to brush up their batting before facing Bangladesh in the do-or-die clash. Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran have been the standout batters for Afghanistan, but apart from them, none of their batters have scored a half-century. Gulbadin Naib’s 49 not out against Papua New Guinea remains the highest score by their middle order batters. Gulbadin has also been excellent with the ball after he picked up 4 wickets against the Aussies. Fazalhaq Farooqi is the leading wicket-taker of the tournament and has been a major reason behind Afghanistan’s surge in the tournament. Rashid Khan has led from the front as he has been amongst the wickets as well. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats Bangladesh, on the other hand, need a miracle to go through. They will be knocked out of the competition if Australia beat India in their last Super 8 match. The Tigers, led by Najmul Hossain Shanto, are languishing at the bottom of the table after losses at the hands of Australia and India. Tanzim Hasan Sakib and Rishad Hossain have performed in the bowling department, but it’s their batting that has let them down. Afghanistan: The Afghans may think about bringing back Najibullah Zadran to strengthen their batting in place of Nangeyalia Kharote, who gave 13 runs in the only over he bowled against Australia. Predicted XI: Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Ibrahim Zadran, Gulbadin Naib, Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Karim Janat, Nangeyalia Kharote/Najibullah Zadran, Rashid Khan (c), Noor Ahmad, Naveen-ul-Haq, Fazalhaq Farooqi Bangladesh: The Tigers may bring back Taskin Ahmed, who did not play against India. Jaker Ali Anik has been underwhelming until now, and it won’t raise eyebrows if he is dropped. Predicted XI: Tanzid Hasan, Litton Das (wk), Najmul Hossain Shanto (c), Towhid Hridoy, Shakib Al Hasan, Mahmudullah, Jaker Ali/Taskin Ahmed, Rishad Hossain, Mahedi Hasan, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Mustafizur Rahman"

After having beaten heavyweights and probable favourites of the tournament, Australia, for the first-ever time in T20Is on June 23, the Rashid Khan-led Afghanistan will head to the Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown, Saint Vincent, with immense confidence. On the other hand, Najmul Shanto's Bangladesh will hold very little incentive for the clash, and will require a big miracle to go through to the semi-final from the last spot in their Group 1. Afghanistan beat Australia by 21 runs, which also happened to be their maiden victory over the 2023 ODI World Cup winners at the international level after 4 ODIs and 2 T20Is. After being asked to bat first, Afghanistan scored 148 for 6 on the back of half-centuries from Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran. Thereafter, they bowled Australia out for 127 in 19.2 overs, spearheaded by Gulbadin Naib's 4/20 and Naveen-ul-Haq's 3/20 spells. This massive win will see Rashid's side go all-out for a win against a pretty toothless Bangladesh, while also keeping an eye on the result of India's clash against Australia on June 24.

Germany's Robert Andrich had a 17th-minute goal ruled out for a foul in the build-up, and 11 minutes later Dan Ndoye scored with a deft volleyed finish for the Swiss before striking the foot of the post two minutes later. Germany exerted enormous pressure in the second half but they struggled to get shots on target, and substitute Fuellkrug had to bale them out with a late header to grab a share of the spoils and secure the group victory. Germany will now face the second-placed team in Group C, with England, Denmark, Slovenia or Serbia all still in the mix, in Dortmund on June 29, while Switzerland will play the second-placed team in Group B on the same day in Berlin, with Italy, Albania and Croatia their potential opponents. Hungary snatched a 100th-minute winner to beat Scotland 1-0 and put themselves in contention for a last-16 spot at the European Championship while condemning the Scots to yet another failure at a major tournament. Kevin Csoboth's breakaway goal with the last kick off the match ensured Hungary finished third in Group A with three points while Scotland crashed out bottom with two, still to get through to the knockout phase of either the Euros or World Cup. Hungary must wait to see whether they will qualify for the last 16 in one of the places reserved for the best four third-placed finishers. Their progress now rests on results from other groups going their way over the next three days."

If Afghanistan beat Bangladesh, Australia would be knocked out of the competition. Conditions stay gloomy as of now as rain keeps playing hide and seek.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story On June 9, sports fans in India were preparing for another high-intensity cricket match with Pakistan in the T20 World Cup 2024 at the Nassau County stadium in New York. However, in the early hours of that day, a 30-year-old Indian stepped into the UFC octagon and created history. Puja 'The Cyclone' Tomar defeated Brazilian Rayanne dos Santos via split decision to win on her UFC debut at the UFC Fight Night: Cannonier vs. Imavov event and become the first Indian to win a fight in the promotion. The morning hours in India saw the media scramble around looking for more information on this fighter, who had made the nation proud on the grandest stage in MMA . Everyone had one question in their mind. Who is Pooja Tomar? Speaking to India Today in an exclusive interaction, the 30-year-old said she wanted people to search about her as she wanted people to know about her story and the hard work behind it. \"This very question of 'who is Pooja Tomar?', I wanted people to search for that, thinking that people should know who I am after so much hard work,\" said Puja. Puja comes from Budhana in village, where the Cyclone started her journey to the world of MMA. The 30-year-old said growing up, she would see that in her village, the preference was always given to boys rather than girls. She said she always carried the thought of showing girls are equally good as compared to boys. \"From childhood I had a passion for fighting. In my village, I have seen that when it came to boys and girls, everyone liked boys more. So it was there inside me that I need to prove that I can be better than the boys. That thought was there from childhood, that I wanted to show that girls aren't less when compared to boys,\" said Puja. Puja also pointed out how she would get angered by people when they would come to taunt her mother after her father's death and felt like fighting all of them. The 30-year-old said she was inspired by Jackie Chan movies and took up martial arts, with a stubbornness to protect her family and learn self-defence. \"After my father's death, everyone would say to my mother, 'Poor girl, her husband is no more, how will she manage the house?' So, I felt like I wanted to fight all these people who would say such things to my mother.\" \"Watching Jackie Chan movies, learning martial arts, it became a stubbornness to learn self-defence and protect my family. I didn't think it would turn into a sport. But I always wanted to play sports from my childhood,\" said Puja. In many interviews, Puja has stated how her father wanted her and her sisters to become athletes. Unfortunately, he passed away when Puja was still young but the dream still lived inside the Cyclone. After her win against Rayenne, Puja feels she has been able to complete her father's dream for her. She said that her thoughts after winning in her UFC debut was how happy her father would have been seeing her on the big stage and under the bright lights. \"Absolutely, his dream is fulfilled because creating history for India is a big deal. And since childhood, my father wanted us to advance. My sisters always had dreams to become doctors or lawyers, but I always wanted to fight. I don't know how, but I was always into fighting. When I won this fight, I thought about how my father would feel if he was here today. He was sad when he had a girl, so I was thinking how happy he would have been seeing me on this big stage,\" said Puja. Puja's mother has also been a big support to her in her MMA journey. The Cyclone said, just like a hardened MMA coach, her mother would brush aside the injuries she would get in a fight, saying it's not serious and even provide her pep talk after she would lose a fight early in her career. \"She always says that it's okay, it's not a serious injury, you'll get better. She is stronger than me, and if I lose a fight, she guides me on what to do better next time. She is amazing,\" said Puja. Post-match interviews in UFC are always eye-catching as the fighters let pour their heart out. Puja loudly claimed in her interview that 'Indians aren't losers' and it left many caught off guard. The 30-year-old explained the reason behind and said she felt a cold vibe towards Indian fighters ahead of her bout as many would easily write them off. \"Yes, before my fight, I had interviews from different countries, and I don't want to name any specific country. But yes, during those interviews, they were very casual. They asked if I thought I could win the fight, as previous Indian fighters couldn't. I said that I had trained hard and my coach worked very hard. Their attitude was very dismissive, as if they were sure I would lose. Many fighters from other countries see Indian fighters and think it will be an easy fight. So, I wanted to change that perception with this fight,\" said Puja. While Puja can see a change in mindset back home, with many parents ready to push their kids into MMA, she feels a lack of good academies in India is a concern. \"Yes, this mindset has changed to some extent. And even today, when I go to the village, some parents come home and ask how to teach their kids. But there is no answer to that because there are no proper academies in India for martial arts. Even today, there aren't many proper academies. So, Indian parents' mentality has changed, but there is no scope yet on how to proceed,\" said Puja. There's a lot of hype now around Puja and how far she can go in the UFC. The 30-year-old set the record straight that she wants to show where India stands in the MMA world by becoming the first Indian UFC Champion and bringing the title home. \"Even after this fight, I see that people are still not fully aware. Some people know me, but I know that the day I win the UFC belt, the whole world will know where India stands. My dream is to perform well in upcoming fights and bring the UFC belt to India,\" said Puja. Before winding up, a simple question was posed to Puja. What would have been her father's reaction to her UFC win if he was there. With a smile her face, the 30-year-old had a simple answer to the question. \"I am proud of you.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story South Africa have made their way through to the semi-final of the T20 World Cup 2024. The Proteas knocked out co-hosts West Indies after winning by 3 wickets (DLS) at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua. In a rain-curtailed match, Aiden Markram’s men held their nerves and chased down a revised target of 123 with 5 balls to spare in a thriller that went right down to the last over. It’s also the third time that South Africa qualified for the semis of the tournament after 2009 and 2014. WI vs SA, T20 World Cup Highlights Having won their seventh win in a row, South Africa also finished their Super 8 on top of the Group 2 table. The Caribbean team, on the other hand, won all their Group C matches, after which they beat the United States by 9 wickets. But they would be gutted after failing to step up against the Proteas in the virtual quarterfinal. After being asked to bat first, West Indies got off to a horrendous start as Shai Hope and Nicholas Pooran departed early with the score at 5 for 2 in 1.1 overs. From there on, Kyle Mayers, who replaced Johnson Charles, and Roston Chase restored sanity with a partnership of 81 runs off 10.5 overs. Mayers looked promising in his 35-run knock before Tabraiz Shamsi accounted for his wicket. ðáðâ RESULT | #SAVWI A thriller in Antigua comes to an end. We take it with a 6 from Jansen! South Africa win by 3 wickets (DLS) #WozaNawe #BePartOfIt #OutOfThisWorld #T20WorldCup pic.twitter.com/WomrMxrD77 — Proteas Men (@ProteasMenCSA) June 24, 2024 Chase, on the other hand, brought up his half-century off 39 balls. But just when he needed to step on the gas, Shamsi accounted for his wicket. The Caribbean team found itself in a hole after skipper Rovman Powell and Sherfane Rutherford faltered. Andre Russell and Alzarri Joseph played cameos of 15 and 11, helping West Indies post 135 for 8. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats Shamsi, who was brought in as a replacement for Ottneil Baartman, was the pick of the bowlers for the Proteas after he finished with figures of 4-0-27-3. Marco Jansen, Aiden Markram, Keshav Maharaj and Kagiso Rabada got one wicket apiece. Rabada was introduced as late as in the 18th over, and he responded with the wicket of Akeal Hosein. South Africa did not get off a pleasant start as Reeza Hendricks and Quinton de Kock perished cheaply. Dee Kock started with 3 fours, but could not carry on. Russell made sure that West Indies made inroads into the opposition batting line-up. Rain threatened to play spoilsport, but only 3 overs were reduced from the run-chase. Markram tried to put his head down before Alzarri Joseph dismissed him for 18. Heinrich Klaasen tried to play the big shots and scored 22 off 10 balls. Yet again, Joseph chipped in and removed the dangerman. With 33 runs needed off 39 deliveries and Tristan Stubbs in the middle, the Proteas were cruising. But after Stubbs departed for 29, the Proteas looked jittery. But Jansen’s vital cameo of 21 off 14 balls took South Africa home in 16.1 overs. The right-handed batter smashed Obed McCoy down the ground for a six to bring the curtains down on the match."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The memories of 19th November 2023 are fresh as India once again face Australia in an ICC tournament on Monday, 24 June. This might not be a semi-final or final of the ICC tournament, but India will look to avenge their ODI World Cup final loss against the Men in Yellow when they clash in the Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup 2024. Set to be played in St Lucia, this will be both team's final match of the Super 8 stage. India already have a foot in the semi-finals, having won two matches. Australia on the other hand have lost against Afghanistan and are just one game away from getting knocked out of the 2024 edition of the T20 World Cup. Australia's chances of qualification depend on them beating India, or on the hopes that Bangladesh will beat Afghanistan to clear their path to the semi-finals. India vs Australia, Super 8: Predicted XI | Weather Forecast Australia are coming off a shock loss against Afghanistan, where they failed to chase down 149 runs. But the loss did not take the Australian arrogance away as captain Mitchell Marsh vowed to put up their best effort against one of the best teams in the world . “We just need to win, there’s no better team to do it against,” Marsh said after the loss vs Afghanistan. The focus will be on the spin prowess of both teams as they head into the final stages of the tournament. Kuldeep Yadav has been fantastic since his inclusion in the side and is definitely undroppable at this stage. With the new ball, Jasprit Bumrah has been unplayable and has been the difference-maker in most of the matches that India have played so far. There was a slight concern about the Indian batting line-up, but that went away against Bangladesh as the side fired in unison. Only one batter - Hardik Pandya - scored a fifty against Bangladesh and yet India put in a total of 196 runs in their last game. An elated Rohit Sharma came out to say that India had finally cracked the code of batting in the T20Is. \"I have been talking about this for a long time now. It's about going there and putting that to work. Considering everything we played really well, and adapted to the conditions. There's a little bit of wind factor here, overall we are very smart, overall we were good with bat and ball,\" Sharma told the broadcasters after the match. India would hope to continue their approach if they are to beat Australia and win the T20 World Cup - a trophy that has eluded them since their victory in 2007. Australia and India have faced each other 31 times in the T20I format. India have dominated the contest, winning 19 matches, while Australia has 11 to their name. India also have a slight advantage over Australia in the T20 World Cups. Out of the five times the two teams have faced each other, India have won 3 times. The last time India and Australia faced each other was way back in 2016, where Virat Kohli pulled off a masterclass against the Aussies in Mohali. India looked like a well-oiled machine in their match against Bangladesh. The batting unit fired in unison, and the bowling unit performed a clinical job led by Jasprit Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav. India have played the same XI throughout the tournament, and this is the last match they can potentially experiment in. Ravindra Jadeja has not done well in the T20 World Cup, and there is a scope to get an additional batter in the line-up. India might opt to bring in Sanju Samson as the extra batter, but that will deplete their bowling reserves. Australia on the other hand are expected to return back to Mitchell Starc, given he can trouble the Indian right handers at the top. In a big match, putting India under pressure early is the way to go and the Mitchell Marsh side might opt to bench either Josh Hazlewood or Ashton Agar from their line-up. It is definitely a tough call to choose from, given Agar bowled a sensational spell of 4-1-17-0. Hazlewood was expensive against Afghanistan, leaking runs at 10 RPO from his four overs, but his dependability in big matches is certainly unquestionable. AUS vs IND: St Lucia Weather and Pitch Report According to weather.com, there is a prediction of thunderstorms during the all-important fixture. However, the rain chances are slightly on the lower side to be at 15 per cent. There are light rain chances of around 5 per cent during the course of the game along with thunderstorms. Hence, Australia will hope for a full-fledged game as a washout and Afghanistan’s win over Bangladesh will knock them out of the tournament. India Predicted XI Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma (c), Rishabh Pant (wk), Suryakumar Yadav, Sanju Samson, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav Australia Predicted XI Travis Head, David Warner, Mitchell Marsh (c), Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Tim David, Matthew Wade (wk), Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood/Ashton Agar"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A group of socially awkward scientists (sans one) and their eccentricities formed the crux of the American television sitcom, 'The Big Bang Theory'. The main characters include Sheldon Cooper, a brilliant but eccentric physicist; Leonard Hofstadter, an experimental physicist and Sheldon's roommate; Howard Wolowitz, an aerospace engineer; and Raj Koothrappali, an astrophysicist who initially struggles to talk to women. Oh, and there is Penny, an aspiring actress and waitress who lives across the hall from Sheldon and Leonard. Along with her, are Amy Farrah Fowler and Bernadette Rostenkowski, who become integral parts of the group as the series progresses. For all you 'The Big Bang Theory' enthusiasts , have you ever wondered who would be cast if the show was made in Bollywood? Ranbir Kapoor would be our Sheldon Cooper and Kangana Ranaut would be his Amy! A rather odd pair, but that is what would be interesting to watch, right? Here, take a look at our Wednesday Wishlist. Sheldon Cooper - Ranbir Kapoor Sheldon Cooper, played by Jim Parsons, was genius, eccentric, socially awkward and obsessive by nature. Known for his method acting and versatility, Ranbir could capture Sheldon’s unique quirks and intellect. His ability to transform into any character makes him ideal for Sheldon’s distinctive personality. Leonard Hofstadter - Rajkummar Rao Leonard (Johnny Galecki) is kind-hearted and intelligent. Rajkummar's ability to play anything and everything under the sky would make him a great fit for the character. A post shared by RajKummar Rao (@rajkummar_rao) Penny - Wamiqa Gabbi Penny (Kaley Cuoco) is outgoing, friendly and street-smart. With her vivacious personality and the great work that she has been doing of late, Wamiqa could perfectly portray Penny’s blend of sassiness and sweetness. A post shared by Wamiqa Gabbi (@wamiqagabbi) Howard Wolowitz - Vikrant Massey Howard (Simon Helberg) is flamboyant, confident, sometimes inappropriate and loves his mother. Known for his strong screen presence, Vikrant would bring a perfect mix of humour and heart to the role of Howard. A post shared by Vikrant Massey (@vikrantmassey) Raj Koothrappali - Sumeet Vyas Raj (Kunal Nayyar) is shy, sensitive, struggles with women and, is from India. Sumeet's ability to portray complex, nuanced characters with the utmost finesse makes him a great fit for Raj. His charm and comedic timing can beautifully bring out Raj’s vulnerability and humour. A post shared by Sumeet Vyas (@sumeetvyas) Amy Farrah Fowler - Kangana Ranaut Amy, portrayed by Mayim Bialik, is intellectual and socially awkward but knows how to love. Kangana's ability to play intelligent and strong female characters makes her a perfect match for Amy. A post shared by Kangana Ranaut (@kanganaranaut) Bernadette Rostenkowski-Wolowitz - Nushrratt Bharuccha Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) is strong-willed, intelligent, and outspoken. Known for her strong personality, Nushrratt can bring the right mix of cuteness and assertiveness to Bernadette’s character. A post shared by Nushrratt Bharuccha (@nushrrattbharuccha) What's your take on our list?"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Indian cinema often casts younger actors to play roles of older people in both TV and movies. Meanwhile, the older actors, equally talented, wait in the wings. Remember t he saga around the 2018 film 'Saand Ki Aankh' when Bhumi Pednekar and Taapsee Pannu played 60-year-olds, and Neena Gupta quipped, \"Hamari umar ke role toh kam se kam humse kara lo bhai (At least let us play the roles that are our age).\" This has been a looming problem for the industry. So, it was a relief when 75-year-old actor Abha Sharma appeared on our screens as Damyanti (Amma Ji) in The Viral Fever's 'Panchayat 3'. When she pestered Sachiv Ji with her question, \" Ghar toh milega na, Sachiv ji? \", the glimmer of recognition that came from the familiarity of her face and action provided more dopamine than it probably should. Actor Abha Sharma disappears into the role of Damyanti. She absorbs the ordinariness of her character and makes it special. The way her hands and lips shiver reminds you of either your grandmother, an elderly woman you visited in your village, or a neighbour whom you saw sitting out on a chair, soaking in winter's sun. Damyanti with Jagmohan in Panchayat 3. The grandmother parts are often underwritten, bland, or naggy that an older woman is pigeonholed into playing. But Abha brings emotional depth to her maternal role. Praise her for her performance in Panchayat 3 and she gives a hearty laugh in response. \" Ye meri kismat hai ki mera kiya kaam logon ko pasand aaya hai (This is my fate that people have liked the work I have done),\" the 75-year-old actor tells IndiaToday.in. The actor, based in Lucknow, is still trying to comprehend the success of the show. \"I am unable to understand what happened. Like my other shows and films, I sat quietly after doing Panchayat as well. But people loved those lanes and that village so much, that every now and then, people are congratulating me for the role. Mujhe bada acha lag raha hai (I am really enjoying it),\" she says. Abha's Damyanti is like any 'daadi ma'. She is super supportive of her grandchild, Jagmohan and strives to secure his future, even if that means feigning illness. Her dialogue from the show, when she tries to convince the doctor that she is unwell, \" Bas mann andar se acha nahi lag raha hai\" , has led to a meme-fest on social media. As we mention the scene to her, she laughs thinking about how it was shot. \"Iska toh bohot mazedaar kissa hai (It has a very interesting story),\" she says, before revealing that she repeated the 'Mann acha nahi lag raha hai' dialogue 10 times. A post shared by Arsh Raj Raushan (@i_am_mature_90) \"Director came and explained the scene to me, but merko samajh hi nahi aa raha tha (I couldn't understand it). So, the person who was assisting me on the set told me to do nothing and just repeat the line 10 times. It so happened that the shot was done, and I was still saying that line. Someone came up to me and asked, 'Why are you still repeating the dialogue? The shot is done,'\" recalls Abha. The person who assisted Abha on the Panchayat 3 sets was Anurag Shukla Shiva, who she met at a theatre and is also her tenant. In one of the episodes, when Damyanti visits Prahlad Cha's (played by Faisal Malik) house and tells him to clean his house, Abha brings a subtle kindness that comes with a lifetime of experience to the character. She doesn’t get too many lines, but she shines with the way her face perks up ever so slightly when she is around her grandchild and senses she has managed to secure his future. A post shared by Abha Sharma - Rani Didi (@abhasharma_ammaji) While watching her ace her every scene, one wonders where this gem of an actor was until now. Actor Abha Sharma harboured a passion for acting since childhood, but she couldn't become one due to the responsibilities of her family. \"It was because of familial responsibilities that I could not work as an actor. My mother was paralysed, and I had to take care of her. There were several other problems.\" Abha Sharma during her college play. However, the actor did take up the teaching profession after gaining a diploma degree from the JJ School of Arts. She says, \"I was an art teacher in a Lucknow school.\" Eventually, in 2008, Abha Sharma got to realise her dream of becoming an actor. She took up the profession after her mother's death without any formal training. She started working as a theatre artist. Her first on-screen project was an ad for Bank Of Baroda, for which she flew to Bombay (now Mumbai). She ended up with more work opportunities. She says, \"I never struggled to find work. Whatever I did, I did it on my own. I didn't take training for it from anyone.\" Actor Abha Sharma during her theatre days. Abha Sharma was offered the Hajiyani biopic after starring in the Bank of Baroda ad. She did films like Daas Dev, Shooter, and Ishaqzaade. In Ishaqzaade, she portrayed the role of Parineeti Chopra's grandmother. The actor didn't get married all her life as she developed a rare health condition. In her late 30s, Abha lost all her teeth due to a gum infection. Nevertheless, this setback didn't hinder her from taking up acting projects. She believes, \"Jab kaam ka junoon ho toh ye sab se farak nahi padta (When there is a passion for work, all this doesn't matter).\" While the audience continues to rave over her performance as Damyanti, Abha Sharma has already completed the shoot of her next project, 'Durga Prasad Ki Dusri Shadi', co-starring Sanjay Mishra and Mahima Chaudhary. Here's hoping to see more of her and character actors who carry a sense of timelessness with them."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The panache-filled West Indies will face off against the unbeaten South Africa in what will be their final Super 8 clash in the 2024 T20 World Cup on June 24 at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua. The clash has full chances of getting panned out as a potential knockout ahead of the semi-finals stage of the competition. While the anticipation for an end-to-end thriller in this game has already reached sky-high, a lot of attention will fall upon the weather conditions that will also play a decisive role in the future of the two sides in the T20 World Cup. Rovman Powell-led West Indies have shown some great character in their T20 World Cup campaign as hosts nations, while Aiden Markram's South Africa have somehow continued to carve out close-call results to their favour. The Proteas walk into this fixture on top of two wins from their two Super 8 clashes against the joint hosts USA and a feisty England. On the other hand, West Indies find themselves in a must-win situation due to their loss to England , but will have some amount of breathing room after managing to defeat USA emphatically in the following game . Even after winning all their games in the tournament, Markram's South Africa boast 4 points but a very at-par net run rate of +0.625, which is below the West Indies' +1.814 who have 2 points in their bag from their USA triumph. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats According to AccuWeather, there is a considerable chance of a thunderstorm in Antigua, which is not good news for either sides' and their semi-final hopes. The temperature range is predicted to range between 31–33 degrees Celsius with a cloudy and humid forecast."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A rampaging Australian team will be facing tricky Afghanistan in their second match of the Super 8 stage in the T20 World Cup on Sunday, 23 June. In the evening match, Australia are expected to be put in under a stern taste by the Afghan spinners, particularly Rashid Khan, who has been in brilliant form throughout the tournament. The match means more to Afghanistan, than Australia in all probability as they have already lost one of their matches against India. The game will be played at Arnos Vale Ground, in St Vincent. Afghanistan's batting unit will look to forget their outing against India and keep pressing on with their attacking intent. Hazratullah Zazai, who was given a chance in this previous game will hope that he comes in terms with the pace and bounce of the pitch as quickly as possible. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats Australia have looked like a well-oiled machine. Travis Head and David Warner have been in superb form and they have been well supported by the bowling department comprising of Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Adam Zampa among others. Afghanistan have faced Australia only once in the T20I format, that too in the T20 World Cup 2022. The match was a close one with Australia clinching a victory by just 4 runs. There are no injuries in either team. Afghanistan were not good with the bat in their previous match and might think about changing Hazratullah Zazai. Australia are not expected to take Afghanistan lightly and are unlikely to make any changes to its playing XI, despite stating multiple times that Ashton Agar and Adam Zampa might play together in the same line-up. The pitch at St Vincent has aided spin. One would do well to remember South Africa's match against Nepal in the same venue where SA just about scraped through with a 1-run win after scoring just 115 runs. In that game, leg spinner Kushal Bhurtel picked 4 wickets to his name. In terms of the weather, there isn’t a heavy prediction for rain with around 30% precipitation chances during the course of the game. Some light showers are expected to interrupt the proceedings but fans can expect a full 40-over fixture. Hence, despite some rain chances, the match is expected to get underway and fans will get to see a complete game full of T20 action. Australia are unlikely to change their playing XI after their thumping win over Bangladesh. The Afghans may give a chance to Mohammad Ishaq, who has scored 75 runs from 4 T20Is with a top score of 32 against Ireland. They also have the option of left-arm spinner Nangeyalia Kharote, who has 5 wickets to his name from 3 games. Australia Predicted XI Travis Head, David Warner, Mitchell Marsh (c), Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Tim David, Matthew Wade (wk), Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood Afghanistan Predicted XI Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Ibrahim Zadran, Hazratullah Zazai/Mohammad Ishaq, Gulbadin Naib, Najibullah Zadran, Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan (c), Noor Ahmad, Naveen-ul-Haq, Fazalhaq Farooqi"

The Aussies have been a nightmare for the Rohit Sharma-led side in the recent past having beaten them in the final of ICC events back-to-back. They first crushed them in the World Test Championship 2023 final and later stunned the Men in Blue with a six-wicket win in the ODI World Cup 2023 final in the latter’s home. However, heading into the upcoming fixture, India look the more comfortable side between the two having won their first two fixtures in the Super 8 stage against Afghanistan and Bangladesh. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats On the other hand, Australia were handed a surprise 21-run defeat against Afghanistan which has put them in a precarious situation. The Mitchell Marsh-led side desperately needs a win in the upcoming fixture to advance to the semi-finals. However, their party could well be spoilt by inclement weather. According to weather.com, there is a prediction of thunderstorms during the all-important fixture. However, the rain chances are slightly on the lower side to be at 15%. There are light rain chances of around 5% during the course of the game along with thunderstorms. Hence, Australia will hope for a full-fledged game as a washout and Afghanistan’s win over Bangladesh will knock them out of the tournament. St Lucia, Gros Islet Weather Report The Mitchell Marsh-led side was on an unbeaten run in the tournament as they also beat defending champions England in their second group-stage fixture by 36 runs . The Kangaroos were once again looking at their invincible best until being stunned by Afghanistan who almost beat them in the ODI World Cup 2023 as well if not for a heroic knock by Glenn Maxwell. However, the Afghans completed the unfinished business of Mumbai in St Vincent and pushed the Aussies on the verge of elimination. Afghanistan’s win has also given a great chance to the Men in Blue to avenge their heart-wrenching losses against Australia by knocking them out of the tournament. Rohit Sharma and his men will be up to the task to get rid of their nemesis in the highly anticipated encounter."

Each team plays two matches in the league stages against teams in their group while one against the other 5 teams. The top four teams in the IPL 2024 points table at the end of the league phase will qualify for the playoffs. The team at the top of the IPL 2024 standings and the second-placed team will meet in Qualifier 1 and have a direct route to the final.

The loser of Qualifier 1 has an extra opportunity to reach the final as they take on the winner of the Eliminator, which will be played between the 3rd and 4th-placed teams in the points table. The extra incentive to teams finishing in the two spots of the IPL Standings has added intensity to the T20 league over the years. In 2023, Chennai and Gujarat finished 1-2 on the points table and they met in the final too. Chennai won the title after beating Gujarat in Ahmedabad.

    "article_content": "The 17th edition of the IPL promises to be one of the most exciting editions of the tournament so far. MS Dhoni and CSK will once again be the favourites but Mumbai, Gujarat and Bangalore will be in the mix for the crown. Mumbai have a new captain in Hardik Pandya and it will be interesting to see how Rohit Sharma adjusts to his new role without the added responsibility. In Bengaluru, Virat Kohli will be back in action after having taken a lengthy break to be with his wife for the birth of his second child. Ahmedabad has a new boss as Shubman Gill has been entrusted with the responsibility of leading Gujarat. Meanwhile, the capital city sees the return of its favourite son, Rishabh Pant after a miraculous recovery from a life-threatening injury. And the big question remains, will this be MS Dhoni’s last season? Currently there is no live match 114/2 (10.3 ov) 113 (18.3 ov) 175/9 (20.0 ov) 139/7 (20.0 ov) 174/6 (19.0 ov) 172/8 (20.0 ov) There is no upcoming match KKR mentor Gautam Gambhir aims to make his team the most successful franchise of the Indian Premier League with an eye to surpass MI and CSK’s tally of most title victories. IPL 2024: Riyan Parag exuded confidence as he talked about his prospects of making it into the Indian team. Parag was the 3rd highest run-scorer of the tournament after Virat Kohli and Ruturaj Gaikwad. India's External Affairs Minister, Dr. S Jaishankar picked Virat Kohli over Sachin Tendulkar and Sunil Gavaskar. Jaishankar had his bias towards Kohli due to his fitness and attitude. 10:58 Mitchell Starc hopes to be retained by KKR ahead of IPL 2025 mega-auction 2:40 Simon Helmot backs Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma to come good in next match 37:53 IPL 2024: MS Dhoni’s heartbreak, toxic RCB-CSK fans and playoffs prediction | Sledging Room S2, Ep 32 3:41 Losing at home is the most worrying aspect for PBKS in IPL 2024: Sanjay Bangar IPL 2024: Abhishek Sharma's father revealed how Yuvraj Singh was impressed by his son's batting and the former India player went onto call Abhishek's batting style smiliar to his own.

Gambhir revealed that the first thing Narine asked was if he could get his girlfriend into the tournament. IPL 2024: The world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa, lit up in colours of purple to celebrate KKR's triumph in the 17th edition of the league. The iconic structure flashed the pictures of KKR squad and Shah Rukh Khan to congratulate them. Have you seen a more dominant campaign than the one KKR had in IPL 2024? KKR looked like champions and played like champions, winning the IPL 2024 trophy in style. They won 9 out of 14 matches in the league stage and hammered the SunRisers in the Qualifier 1 to progress to the final. Let's not talk about the title match! It was one of the most one-sided tournament finals, definitely the most one-sided IPL final -- KKR crushed SRH, chasing down 114 runs in just 9.3 overs in Chennai. In the latest episode of the Sledging Room Podcast, Akshay Ramesh, Saurabh Kumar and Kingshuk Kusari reflect on KKR's run. And also pick the IPL 2024 Team of the Tournament. IPL 2024: Rishabh Pant opened up about his inability to even brush his teeth for 2 months after the car accident. He also revealed that he was reluctant to go to the airport while being in a wheelchair. IPL 2024: Chandrakant Pandit opined that Shreyas Iyer has it in him to lead the India team in the coming future. Iyer led the KKR franchise to their 3rd IPL title by defeating SRH in the finals."

A service voter who opts for voting through a proxy is called Classified Service Voter (CSV). <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> Service voters can appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf by filling Form 13F on the Election Commission website. The proxy must be an ordinary resident of the same constituency and can be appointed in two ways: 1. If the service voter is at their duty station, they sign Form 13F before their commanding officer, then sends it to their proxy for signature before a notary or first class magistrate. The proxy can submit the form to the returning officer. 2. If the service voter is at his hometown, the voter and their proxy can sign Form 13F before a notary or first class magistrate and then send it to the returning officer. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> You can vote using postal ballot only if you work for the military, the government or are on election duty and are posted outside your state; or you have been taken into custody as \"preventive detention\". EVMs expedite counting of votes, taking only a few hours for an entire constituency compared to weeks with paper ballots. This swift process minimizes tampering risks, enhancing electoral efficiency.For more information on EVM vs postal ballot , refer to this resource. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> An EVM or Electronic Voting Machine is an electronic device for recording of votes. It consists of two units - a control unit and a balloting unit. Since 2010, the Election Commission has been phasing in a third unit called the VVPAT or the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail. It allows voters to verify that their votes have been recorded correctly by printing a paper receipt. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> The Election Commission's technical experts committee, along with Bharat Electronics Ltd and Electronic Corporation of India Ltd, designed the EVM. These machines have two parts: a control unit and a balloting unit connected by a cable. The control unit is with the election official, and the balloting unit is in the voting compartment. Instead of a paper ballot, the official releases a digital ballot, and voters cast their votes by pressing a button on the balloting unit for their chosen candidate. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> The control unit can store the result in its memory until the data is deleted or cleared. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> No, once a button on the balloting unit is pressed for a candidate, the vote is recorded, and the machine locks it. Pressing the button again or any other button won't record additional votes, ensuring the 'one man, one vote' principle. The next vote can only be cast when the presiding officer or polling officer releases the ballot by pressing the ballot button. This is a clear advantage over the ballot paper system. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> According to the Election Commission, EVMs are secure and accurate. Despite occasional concerns over glitches, experts have said that EVMs are less susceptible to manipulation than traditional ballot boxes, making them vital for the large-scale and efficient conduct of elections in India. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> Advantages of EVMs include eliminating 'invalid votes' that were common with paper ballots. EVMs provide a more accurate reflection of voters' choices. They also save significant costs by doing away with the requirement of millions of ballot papers. EVMs make the counting process much quicker, with results declared within 3 to 5 hours compared to the conventional 30-40 hours. How to cast your vote using EVM <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> EVMs do not require electricity to run. EVMs run on an ordinary battery assembled by Bharat Electronics Limited/Electronics Corporation of India Limited. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> An EVM can record a maximum of 2,000 votes. In case of M2 EVMs (used during 2006-10), EVMs can cater to a maximum of 64 candidates, including NOTA. There is provision for 16 candidates in a balloting unit. If the total number of candidates exceeds 16, more balloting units can be attached (one per 16 candidates) up to a maximum of 64 candidates by connecting four balloting units. However, in case of M3 EVMs (used post 2013), EVMs can cater to a maximum of 384 candidates, including NOTA by connecting 24 balloting units. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> If an EVM at a polling station malfunctions, it is replaced with a new one. Votes recorded until the EVM malfunction is safely stored in the control unit's memory. Polling can resume without starting over. On counting day, votes from both control units are tallied for the polling station's final result. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) is a system linked with EVMs. It lets voters verify their votes by printing a slip with the candidate's details for 7 seconds, visible through a window. The slip is then cut and it falls into the sealed VVPAT drop box. VVPATs with EVMs were used for first time in a bye-election in the Noksen (ST) Assembly constituency of Nagaland. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> Only the authorised engineers of the EVM manufacturers, Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), perform the initial check of EVMs and VVPATs. This is done under the control of the District Election Officer, and under the supervision of deputy DEO and representatives of all political parties. The process is recorded on video. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> When a voter presses the 'blue button' next to their chosen candidate, a red light appears on that candidate's symbol, and a long beep sound is heard. This gives the voter both a visual and audio confirmation that their vote has been recorded correctly. Additionally, the VVPAT produces a paper slip for the voter to visually verify that their vote has indeed been correctly registered for their chosen candidate. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> Yes, there is a device called a 'Totalise' that can combine votes from up to 14 control units without showing the count for each candidate from a specific EVM at a polling station. Currently, this device is not in use because their technical aspects and related matters are under review, and there is also a court case ongoing over it. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> For more details you can visit election commission official website i.e. https://www.eci.gov.in/ <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> NOTA or \"None of the above\" is a voting option on EVMs that allows voters to reject every candidate in their constituency. It was introduced in October 2013 following a Supreme Court order. In the 2022 election, Bihar registered the highest NOTA votes at 2.48% followed by Gujarat at 1.8%. In the 2023 assembly polls to five states, Chhattisgarh recorded the maximum NOTA votes at 1.29 per cent. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> According to the Election Commission, even if the number of voters choosing NOTA is higher than the number of votes polled by any of the candidates, the candidate who has the largest number of votes has to be declared winner. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> The model code of conduct is a set of guidelines that candidates, political parties and governments must follow to keep elections fair. It is basically a set of dos and don'ts that regulates the conduct of political parties in the run-up to elections. These generally include restrictions on government announcements and freebies that can influence voters. The model code of conduct comes into effect as soon as the Election Commission announces poll dates. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> During Lok Sabha election, the code applies nationwide. For state assembly elections, the code applies to the entire state.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Sanjay Kapoor stars in ‘House of Lies,’ a Zee5 drama that delves into the dark world of deception and corporate greed. Known for his versatile roles in Hindi cinema, Kapoor brings a nuanced performance to this intense narrative, showcasing his acting prowess and adding depth to the complex storyline. In an exclusive chat with IndiaToday.in, Sanjay spoke about what it means to be an actor in today’s time, his second innings and feeling validated with his work getting appreciated. Excerpt from the interview: Do you feel you have earned more credibility as an actor in your second innings because today people shower praise for your performances, which perhaps didn’t happen often during your initial days? Yes, today when my name is a part of a project, the audience is expecting something interesting. But it did not happen overnight. It's hard work and a lot that I've given in the past 30 years. So, this kind of thing doesn't come just by working in a few films and delivering a successful film. Also, people have seen my ups and downs, and they appreciate that. It's tough to get into OTT and movies today because there is so much choice. There are lots of projects, along with choice. Everybody is going for fresh casting, so to break that and to still be relevant is also tough. How does one stay relevant in today’s time? You must balance it out. You must be clever enough to keep working, because if you don't work, you will be out of circulation and out of news. And if you get a choice of doing versatile roles, then take that. I've been very fortunate, besides different kind of roles, I have worked with the most amazing talent of directors available in the country, be it Ali Abbas Zafar for ‘Bloody Daddy’ or Homi Adajania for ‘Murder Mubarak’ or Sriram Raghavan for ‘Merry Christmas’. A lot of credit should go to the kind of films that I'm also doing, the kind of people I'm working with, because that's the reason I feel the body of work boasts of diverse roles. This also means sometimes you have to say no as well? Yes, it's very tough sometimes to say no because there are a lot of egos involved. People sometimes don't understand, but I make it a point to speak to them personally, go to their office and tell them, even if I'm saying no to a project. After working for 30 years and being born in this line, I understand how to manage this. For example, when I got offered ‘Bloody Daddy,' before that, Ali had called me up for ‘Tandav Season 2’. But it didn’t happen because I wasn’t completely happy with what I was offered. I remember I met him personally, and I told him, ‘Ali, I would love to work with you, but I'm not at this stage to do something like that.’ But hats off to him, he didn’t take it personally and when a good role came by, he offered me. Eventually, everybody wants to work. Everybody wants to make a good film. Do you feel people are now taking notice of you as an actor more? I totally agree with that. It is also because of my sheer perseverance. It's my hard work and not losing faith even when good work doesn't get appreciated. But you must keep going. I remember for ‘Luck By Chance’, I got so much appreciation but didn’t sign anything after that for a year. Sometimes destiny also plays a huge part. Surprisingly, today, when things are going right, I am getting credit for those films as well. People are talking about ‘Luck By Chance’ as well. You must keep working hard, and you should see your glass as half full and be positive."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The trailer of 'Rautu Ka Raaz', starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui in the lead role, has been released. The film is set in the picturesque village of Rautu Ki Beli in Uttarakhand. It revolves around the mysterious death of a warden at a blind school in a sleepy town which hasn’t witnessed a murder in over a decade and a half. SHO Deepak Negi, portrayed by Nawazuddin Siddiqui, and his team find themselves thrust into the spotlight as they tackle a rare, high-profile murder case. The film delves into the quirky and humorous relationship between Negi and Sub Inspector Dimri, played by Rajesh Kumar. Initially, in a state of complacency, the duo is jolted into action by the demands of this intriguing investigation. As the plot unfolds, viewers are treated to a blend of suspense and comedy, offering a unique take on a murder mystery. Prepare for a thrilling ride as the laziest detectives embark on an unexpectedly engaging quest for the truth. Watch the trailer of 'Rautu Ka Raaz' here: Nawazuddin Siddiqui said, \"The trailer of 'Rautu Ka Raaz' is a tantalizing glimpse into the gripping world that awaits the viewers. I am someone who enjoys watching crime dramas, and hence, I can confidently say that this film will be an entertaining watch with a unique twist. What really sets 'Rautu Ka Raaz' apart are the quirky characters and the lazy but breathtaking backdrop of Uttarakhand. The trailer encapsulates the film's suspenseful plot and highlights the film’s USP i.e., a smart cop unravelling a lazy murder investigation. We had a Gala Premiere at IFFI last year where we received a warm response and now with the film’s release on Zee5, I am looking forward to the film reaching Zee5's viewers across 190+ countries”.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The trailer of Tahira Kashyap's directorial, 'Sharmajee Ki Beti', is finally out. Starring Sakshi Tanwar, Divya Dutta, and Saiyami Kher in the lead roles, along with Vanshika Taparia, Arista Mehta, Sharib Hashmi and Parvin Dabas, the film explores aspirations, dreams, and coming-of-age moments in the lives of quintessentially middle-class women from diverse backgrounds - all with the surname 'Sharma'. 'Sharmajee Ki Beti' is Prime Video's upcoming offering. The slice-of-life comedy will delve into the lives of three ordinary women and their meagre asks from life. However, sometimes the most common demand of a woman comes with a price tag - either in the form of disrespect or disapproval. The trailer of 'Sharmajee Ki Beti' promises a rollercoaster of emotions and laughter as it delves into the lives of three remarkable women, all sharing the surname 'Sharma,' each navigating distinct and formidable challenges. Jyoti, a middle-class marvel, strives to balance her career with her roles as a wife and mother. Kiran, a vivacious homemaker, finds her world turned upside down after relocating from Patiala to Mumbai, but this move also sets her on a journey of self-discovery. Meanwhile, Tanvi, a young cricket sensation known for her prowess on the field, faces the challenge of convincing her boyfriend that her ambitions stretch far beyond marriage. The trailer also offers a brief glimpse into the lives of two teenage Sharma girls, capturing their struggles with growing up. Watch the trailer of 'Sharmajee Ki Beti' here: Tahira Kashyap, the writer and director of 'Sharmajee Ki Beti', said, “'Sharmajee Ki Beti' is a dream come true for me. The film is special to me not only because it marks my directorial debut, but also because it has provided me with an opportunity to explore a subject very close to my heart – women's empowerment. The light-hearted, comical narrative highlights the everyday struggles, triumphs, and diverse experiences of middle-class women. Each character reflects a part of my own journey, making it deeply personal. I'm thrilled to have collaborated with Applause Entertainment and Ellipsis Entertainment, whose support has been invaluable in bringing this vision to life, and I am absolutely thrilled that the film will be exclusively premiering on Prime Video, in India and over 200 countries and territories around the world. I believe this authentic slice-of-life narrative has the potential to resonate with audiences worldwide, and I eagerly wait for their response.” Sakshi Tanwar, who plays Jyoti Sharma, shared, “When I first read the script, it stirred a multitude of emotions within me. From moments of helplessness and sadness to bursts of pride and joy, this movie truly resonated with me as a celebration of modern, new-age women. Sharmajee Ki Beti is a powerful call for women to stand tall and be proud of who we are and what we can achieve. My character, Jyoti, mirrors the lives of millions of women around the world, striving to balance societal expectations with their own dreams and aspirations. Although she has a wonderfully supportive partner who believes in her dreams, she struggles with the tantrums and expectations of her teenage daughter. I believe audiences, not just women, in India and around the world will love the humorous and relatable take on important issues like gender roles, relationships, and personal identity. The sensitive portrayal of these themes will strike a chord with everyone.” “I feel Sharmajee Ki Beti offers a refreshing narrative that focuses on the intricacies of everyday life and relationships from the perspective of females belonging to different generations, each with unique personalities and outlooks on life. When I read the script, I fell in love with my character, Kiran and the beautiful vulnerability it had. She appears to be quite flighty by nature, but there's an undercurrent of strong emotions due to the circumstances she faces in her personal life. Portraying Kiran allowed me to explore new facets of my acting abilities that I hadn't tapped into before. Tahira’s vision for this film was both clear and inspiring; it was truly fascinating to work with her and bring this story to life,” said Divya Dutta, who plays Kiran Sharma. Saiyami Kher, as Tanvi, stated, “Sharmajee Ki Beti has been a very special journey. When Tahira narrated the film to me, I instantly loved it. It was such a fresh feel-good feeling after the narration. Tanvi’s role was a liberating reminder that everyone must follow their dreams and passions and not get bogged down by societal pressure. Through Tanvi’s story, the film highlights how many of us navigate similar struggles, constantly balancing personal aspirations with societal expectations. It’s a relatable narrative for anyone who’s ever felt torn between obligation and dreams, encouraging viewers to find their own path to fulfillment. I'm confident that this heartfelt story will resonate deeply with everyone who watches it on Prime Video, in India and over 200 countries and territories.\" 'Sharmajee Ki Beti' releases on June 28 on Prime Video."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The trailer for the new Prime Video series, 'Mirzapur' Season 3, arrived on Thursday. The show boasts a splendid starcast, but Pankaj Tripathi stands tall with his presence in a two minute, 37-second video. The makers teased the audience with a 10-second screen-time for the actor, and it was enough for Tripathi to do exactly what the makers wanted: create a solid buzz. The video begins in its signature style - a few abusive words here and there, followed by action. Guddu Bhaiya, played by Ali Fazal, is the man on a mission. He will take over the throne of Mirzapur as the most powerful gangster and will eventually become the ruler of ' Purvanchal '. But, it's not a cakewalk. The trailer hints at Guddu Bhaiya's journey of turning into a mad king, the kind who meets their end as soon as they taste power. Tripathi's Kaleen Bhaiya is the exact opposite. His kind of fear doesn't originate from what he does when he is in power, but how he thinks when he is not. He may be the defeated king right now, and a wounded one too, after losing his entire family in a snap. But, can Mirzapur ever truly forget him and accept Guddu? For Kaleen Bhaiya, ' gaddi and parampara ' are paramount, and he will now do what has never happened in the history of Purvanchal to save the legacy of his father. 'Mirzapur' season 3 may seem all about the rise and rise of Guddu Bhaiya, but it is certainly not about the fall of Kaleen Bhaiya. At least that's what the last 10-seconds of the trailer suggest. The video doesn't give away the story but keeps you hooked with the introduction of almost all the characters in the season. Except for Divyenndu as Munna Bhaiya (only if you want to believe that he's indeed coming back). Shweta Tripathi Sharma, Vijay Varma, Rasika Dugal, Isha Talwar, Priyanshi Painyuli, Harshita Shekhar Gaur, Anjumm Shharma, Meghna Malik, Manu Rishi Chadha and Sheeba Chadha make fine appearances. However, Rajesh Tailang, as Guddu's father, Ramakant Pandit, makes you rewind and play the trailer again. In a scene which shines beautifully, Ramakant stands in a court, solemnly telling the judge about the only thing that troubles him the most: being Guddu Pandit's father. \"Humara dukhda yahi hai ki hum Guddu Pandit ke baap hai...( My sorrow is that I am Guddu Pandit's father),\" he says, as the scene slowly progresses to show Rasika Dugal's Beena Tripathi, arguably one of her finest characters on screen. As she tells Guddu, \" Guddu Pandit ko koi challenge nahi kar sakta, ye message pure Purvanchal me goonjna chahye (No one can challenge Guddu Pandit; this message should echo throughout Purvanchal),\" you silently cheer for the woman who has finally got her agency back. But the million-dollar question remains: what will happen when Kaleena Bhaiya comes back? 'Mirzapur' Season 3 will start premiering from July 5 on Prime Video. The show is directed by Gurmmeet Singh and Anand Iyer, and is expected to leave you on yet another major cliffhanger. Too much to sink in this time, no?"

The show streams from 9 pm on JioCinema app. Earlier it was reported that Anil Kapoor and Arjun Kapoor will groove to ‘Chokra Jawan’ on the stage. Arjun will also wish good luck to his uncle as he embarks on a new journey as a reality show host. While the show's team had planned a special uncle-nephew dance act, things could not materialise at the last moment. The first season of 'Bigg Boss OTT' was hosted by Karan Johar, followed by Salman Khan last year. This year, Anil Kapoor has taken over. When asked about how people will compare their hosting skills, Anil said, \"Munawar [Faruqui], this is a very wrong question which has been put to me. No one can replace Salman Khan, and no one can replace Anil Kapoor as well. Salman is very happy, I spoke to him earlier about this. Let's not create any controversy, that will happen in Bigg Boss' house.\" Anil Kapoor also joked that he received tips from his wife Sunita Kapoor about hosting the controversial reality show. A post shared by JioCinema (@officialjiocinema) He said, \"Everyone in my family was very excited about it. I was really surprised that my wife was very excited about the fact that I would be hosting Bigg Boss. Unki prerna leke aaya hoon (I have taken tips and inspiration from her and come here). She lightly said you already know how to take care of the house as you have seen me do it, so you are ready to host Bigg Boss now.\" This season features a mix of TV actors, influencers, newsmakers, musicians, and sports personalities. Some of the names include Sai Ketan Rao (TV actor), Paulomi Polo Das (Actor), Sana Sultan (Influencer), Sana Makbul (Actor), Shivani Kumari (Rural Influencer), Vishal Pandey (Influencer), Chandrika Gera Dixit (Vada Pav Girl), Naezy (Singer), Neeraj Goyat (Wrestler), Deepak Chaurasia (Journalist), Munisha Khatwani (Actor and Tarot Card Reader), Armaan Malik and two wives - Payal and Kritika."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Actor Karan Singh Grover is happily married to Bipasha Basu. However, in his latest interview, he took a moment to talk about his two divorces. The actor's first marriage with Shraddha Nigam ended in 2008, after which, he married Jennifer Winget . The two were only married for 10 months and had a difficult divorce. Karan now answered why he never spoke about his previous marriages in the media. In an interview with the Bombay Times , the actor mentioned that divorces and breakups were so personal that he never felt it was necessary to talk about those decisions. KSG, as he is popularly called, said, \"There's nothing good about a breakup or a divorce. Yeah, later when people move on, they realize that it happened for the best. That's a good thing. But I never felt the need to speak to anyone about the crap that's happening in my life, because I don't expect people to come and talk to me about the crap that's happening in their life. That is not my main motive.\" He went on to talk about the importance of guarding one's privacy. Karan highlighted that people are dealing with so much in their lives, and they can decide not to let the world know of their struggles. He added, \"I would like to spread some love and joy. Everyone has their own s**t to deal with, and I think everyone deserves that kind of privacy to handle their own s**t.\" Karan married Bipasha in April 2016. He complimented her for bringing a whirlwind of positive changes to his life. The actor mentioned that it is because of her he has found a new calling and become a better person today. KSG explained, \"All the heavy, all the negative, the lower vibration stuff just falls. I have another profession (painting) because of her. She helped me understand and connect with me. The real me. I know myself today because of her.\" Karan was recently seen in 'Fighter' alongside Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone in January this year. He received appreciation for his performance in the role of Sartaj Gill, a fighter pilot kidnapped and tortured by the Pakistani army."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story e-Chunav, India Today's online poll that was conducted to gauge the voter's mood ahead of the Lok Sabha election results on June 4, saw an overwhelming 73 per cent of the participants backing the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA for a third straight term. The opposition INDIA bloc received around 23 per cent of the nearly 1.3 lakh votes cast on e-Chunav. Around four per cent of the votes went to Others. In terms of seats, the survey revealed the NDA is likely to get 397 seats, narrowly missing out on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's '400 paar' dream. INDIA is projected to win 121 seats. To calculate e-Chunav's seat projections, we converted the vote share percentage in a particular state into the corresponding percentage of Lok Sabha seats for that state. It's important to note that e-Chunav, an online poll, may not entirely reflect the entire nation's mood as only around 50 per cent people in India use the Internet. The e-Chunav, which follows a 'one number, one vote' format, was opened on April 19 as India voted in the first phase and was closed on June 1 with the completion of the seventh phase. Users had to choose their respective states and then vote for the party of their choice. To avoid duplication, users were allowed to vote only once through their mobile number and the votes were kept confidential. The e-Chunav result shows massive support in favour of the BJP in the Hindi heartland states as well as the western region. The survey also shows that the BJP has received the maximum number of votes from respondents in states like Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. The party has historically not fared well in the southern states. The survey, however, shows a wave in favour of the INDIA bloc in the northeast region, considered a stronghold of the BJP. The Congress received the maximum number of votes in ethnic strife-torn Manipur as well as Mizoram and Nagaland. The results show a close fight in Arunachal Pradesh even though most have voted in favour of the BJP in Assam. The picture, however, will only be clear on June 4, when the votes will be counted. The first e-Chunav was held a few months before the 2014 Lok Sabha election, and it correctly predicted the outcome of the polls. The BJP-led NDA came to power winning 336 seats, decimating the Congress-led UPA in 2014. In the 2019 general election, the India Today e-Chunav's prediction was yet again close to the actual result as the NDA won 353 seats while the Opposition alliance's tally stood at 91. UTTAR PRADESH In the key battleground state of Uttar Pradesh, e-chunav results show a projection of 57 seats for the NDA, a marginal dip from its tally in 2019. It has given 20 seats to INDIA. The India Today-Axis My India exit poll predicted 64–67 seats for the NDA and 8–12 seats for the INDIA bloc. ABP-CVoter and Today's Chanakya have forecast 62–66 seats and 68 seats for NDA respectively. BIHAR The NDA is also likely to see a dip in seat numbers in Bihar as per the e-chunav projection. It has projected 29 seats for the NDA, with nearly 73% vote share. For INDIA, it has projected 9 seats, with a 22% vote share. The India Today-Axis My India exit poll forecast 29–33 seats for the NDA, which comprises the BJP, JD(U), and Chirag Paswan's LJP. While CVoter said the BJP is likely to win 34–38 seats, Chanakya predicted 36 seats. RAJASTHAN The desert state of Rajasthan may see the BJP bag 18 of the total 26 seats, with a 71% vote share, as per the projection by e-chunav. It has projected six seats for the INDIA bloc, with 24% share of the total votes. Other pollsters, however, have forecast a higher number of seats for the BJP, which recently upstaged the Congress in the Assembly polls. The India Today-Axis My India exit poll predicted 16–19 seats for the NDA, while giving 5–7 seats to INDIA. CVoter and Chanakya predicted 21-23 and 22 seats for the NDA. DELHI The NDA is likely to fall short of a complete sweep again in the national capital. e-Chunav has projected six of the seven seats for the BJP in Delhi and one for the AAP-Congress alliance. Most other exit polls have predicted a similar scenario. The India Today-Axis My India exit poll forecast 6–7 seats for the BJP, while CVoter has given anywhere between 4–6 seats to the ruling party. WEST BENGAL West Bengal, which saw a campaign blitzkrieg by PM Modi and politics over protests at Sandeshkhali, is likely to see a saffron wave. e-Chunav has projected 34 of the 42 seats in favour of the BJP with a vote share of nearly 81%. It has projected just 5 seats for the ruling Trinamool Congress and 3 seats for Congress. Other pollsters have projected anywhere between 24–27 seats for the NDA, including CVoter and Chanakya. The India Today-Axis My India exit poll predicted 26–31 seats for the NDA and 11-14 for the TMC. GUJARAT The BJP is likely to maintain its grip on its bastion Gujarat. e-Chunav has projected a minor dip in seats for the NDA, giving it 22 of the 26 seats. It has projected 4 seats for the INDIA alliance. Most pollsters have predicted a clean sweep by the BJP in Gujarat. The India Today-Axis My India exit poll forecast 25–26 seats for the BJP. The INDIA bloc may at best win one seat. KARNATAKA Despite losing the state elections last year, the NDA's fortunes in Karnataka in the Lok Sabha polls is not likely to see a dent. e-Chunav has projected 23 seats for NDA, with a vote share of 82%. It has given 5 seats to INDIA. The India Today-Axis My India exit poll predicted 23–25 seats for the NDA in Karnataka and 3-5 seats for the Congress. CVoter and Chanakya have also projected anywhere between 23–25 seats for the NDA. MAHARASHTRA The key battleground of Maharashtra is also likely to see a major chunk of the seats go to the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance. e-Chunav has projected 33 of the 48 seats for the NDA. It has given 13 seats to INDIA, which comprises Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena faction and Sharad Pawar's NCP. The Axis My India exit poll predicted 28-32 of 48 seats in Maharashtra for the NDA alliance and 16-20 for INDIA bloc. As per the vote share prediction by Axis My India exit poll, the NDA is likely to bag 46% of the votes. ODISHA e-Chunav data showcases a twist in Odisha, with the NDA projected to win 16 of the 21 seats in the bastion of BJD's Naveen Patnaik. The BJD is projected to get just three seats. The Axis My India exit poll has predicted 18–20 seats for the BJP. The exit poll has given anywhere between 0–2 seats for the BJD. Congress may likely bag 0–1 seats. The forecast also matches the predictions of other pollsters. CVoter and Chanakya have given 16–19 seats to the NDA. TAMIL NADU A keenly watched state, Tamil Nadu has been predicted by most pollsters to vote for INDIA. However, eChunav has projected the NDA to win 27 seats in the state that has been the key focus of PM Modi. The DMK, e-Chunav has projected, may bag just 10 seats. The Axis My India exit poll has given 33–37 seats to the DMK-Congress alliance while predicting 2–4 seats for BJP. In the 2019 polls, the BJP had drawn a blank in the state. TELANGANA The BJP went all out in Telangana, and it seems to have paid dividends as per the e-Chunav results. e-Chunav has projected an overwhelming 13 of the 17 seats for the BJP in the state that was recently won by the Congress in the Assembly polls. It has given just 3 seats to Congress and nil to the BRS. Other pollsters, while predicting gains for the NDA, gave anywhere between 7–9 seats to the BJP-led alliance. Chanakya forecast 12 seats for the NDA while the Axis My India exit poll predicted 11–12 seats for it. UTTARAKHAND The Himalayan state of Uttarakhand is likely to see another clean sweep by the BJP if exit polls are to be believed. e-Chunav has projected 4 of the 5 seats for the BJP, while giving one to the Congress. The Axis My India exit poll, Chanakya and CVoter have all forecast a 5-0 result in favour of the BJP in Uttarakhand. On Saturday, exit polls predicted a hat-trick for the BJP , with Prime Minister Narendra Modi likely to return to power for a historic third term. Most pollsters said the NDA was likely to surpass its 2019 tally of 353 seats and get anywhere between 350–380 seats. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP won 303 seats, while the Congress was reduced to 53 seats and its allies to 38. The India Today-Axis My India poll predicted 361–401 seats for the NDA, and 131–166 seats for INDIA. Chanakya predicted a much higher tally for the NDA, giving 335 seats to the BJP and 400 to the NDA, with a margin of 15 seats either way. PM Modi had set a target of 370 seats for the BJP and 400 for the NDA."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Filmmaker Nitesh Tiwari's upcoming film, Ramayana, starring Ranbir Kapoor and Sai Pallavi in lead roles, is among the most-awaited films this year. Recently, Amrit Sagar, grandson of Ramanand Sagar, who directed and produced the Indian television show Ramayan, shared his perspective on the dos and don'ts of making a film about the life of Lord Ram. “I feel that Ramayan should be made by everybody, why not? Nobody has a copyright on Ramayan. My only thing with that is, do it honestly. Don’t try to make Ramayan through the perspective of this person or that person. Ramayan is not about that. It is the story of Ram, that is why it is titled Ramayan,” Amrit told indianexpress.com. He added, \"For us to try and change something that has been written eons ago and accepted as a scripture... It’s like trying to change the Bible. It’s sacrilege. You don’t do that kind of stuff. Follow the text as it has been written and then try to do your honest work within that framework. You can’t hurt the sentiments of so many people; that’s wrong.” Though the makers of Ranbir Kapoor-led Ramayana haven't officially announced the film yet, leaked photos of the actors from the set often excite movie buffs. Additionally, Ranbir Kapoor's fitness trainer frequently shares videos of the actor's rigorous fitness routine in preparation for the role of Lord Ram. Recently, filmmaker Om Raut made the mythological drama Adipurush, touted to be a modern-day Ramayana. The film received criticism for its dialogues and visual effects. Made on a budget of Rs 500 crore, it starred Prabhas, Saif Ali Khan, and Kriti Sanon in lead roles."

Speaking to YouTuber Janice Sequeira, Anurag said, \"I am not bad at maintaining relationships. Abhay, I have not met him since the shooting of Dev D. He didn’t even come for promotions and he has never spoken to me since. If he wants to call me toxic, fine, it’s his side of story. The truth can’t be spoken, because if I will speak the truth, he won’t be able to show his face.\" \"There is too much truth in there that Abhay will also not have the courage to talk about. And I will not talk about it because it will make him look like s**t,” Kashyap concluded. Kashyap was also asked whether he faces any difficulty in maintaining relationships, to which, he replied, \"I can’t always make people happy. I avoid working with people who I think are problematic, and the ones who think I am problematic are the ones with whom I have never worked. That’s why they categorise me as a problematic person.” On the work front, Anurag Kashyap was seen in the Disney Plus Hotstar series, Bad Cop ."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story 'Munjya' has entered its third weekend at the Box Office. It is the fourth film in Maddock's horror-comedy universe and is now only behind 'Stree' in terms of numbers. Starring Sharvari Wagh, Mona Singh and Abhay Verma in the lead, the film has surpassed Bhediya's lifetime-collection at the ticket window. 'Munjya' collected around Rs 68 crore by the end of its second week, and it has gone past Bhediya's lifetime earnings of Rs 68.99 crore after Friday's business. The Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon-starrer, which was released on November 2022, collected Rs 56.71 crore in two weeks, which is way less than what 'Munjya' has collected in the same time. 'Stree', starring Rajkummar Rao and Shraddha Kapoor, continues to be at the top with a lifetime earning of Rs 130 crore. 'Munjya' has maintained a steady pace at the Box Office despite solid competition from Kartik Aaryan's 'Chandu Champion' . After collecting Rs 35.3 crore in the first week, it didn't show any major fall, collecting Rs 32.65 crore in the second week. The real test for the film will, however, begin once Prabhas' magnum opus, 'Kalki 2898 AD', releases on June 27. 'Munjya' has received a good response from both the audience and critics. It will be interesting to see if all the positive word-of-mouth helps it cross the benchmark of Rs 100 crore in its lifetime run. It shouldn't be a difficult feat to achieve considering the third week is expected to add another Rs 20–22 crore to the business, taking the total beyond Rs 100 crore. 'Munjya' has already emerged as the second-biggest film from Maddock's supernatural universe. It is difficult to surpass 'Stree' but the film has definitely helped Maddock build a stronger cinematic universe."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Gujarat High Court has lifted its temporary stay on the release of Aamir Khan's son, Junaid Khan's debut film, ‘Maharaj.’ The film is currently streaming on Netflix. The court ruled that the film, based on events related to the 1862 Maharaj Libel Case, was not intended to hurt the sentiments of any community. Justice Sangeeta K. Vishen, who had initially barred the film's release on June 13, permitted Netflix to stream it after watching the movie. ‘Maharaj’ features Aamir Khan's son, Junaid, along with Jaideep Ahlawat and Sharvari Wagh in key roles. “This court arrives at the prima facie conclusion that the film, Maharaj, is based on events that led to the filing of the libel case and is not targeted at hurting the sentiments of the Pushtimargi community. The film had been certified by the Central Board for Film Certification, an expert body after considering the relevant guidelines. The interim relief granted on June 13 has been vacated,” the court said. Originally scheduled for release on June 14, 'Maharaj' was put on hold when the High Court barred Netflix from streaming it. This decision came after a group of businessmen petitioned the court, arguing that the film had the potential to offend the religious sensibilities of the Vaishnav community. Here's a glimpse of 'Maharaj': The pause order was issued on a petition filed on behalf of devotees of Lord Krishna and followers of Vallabhacharya, which is the Pushtimarg sect. The petition alleged that the movie, apparently based on the Maharaj Libel Case of 1862, is likely to affect public order and incite violence against the followers of the sect and the Hindu religion. Other than Junaid, the film also stars Jaideep Ahlawat and Shalini Pandey , with Sharvari Wagh in a guest appearance. ‘Maharaj’ is directed by Siddharth P Malhotra and bankrolled by Aditya Chopra under the YRF Entertainment banner."

The Spaniard thanked his team for keeping his morale high and giving him the confidence to play in the tournament. “To my team, it’s been incredible work the last month. We were struggling a lot with the injury. Coming back to Madrid, I didn’t feel well the next weeks we had a lot of doubts. Coming here without practicing too many hours on the court,” Alcaraz said in the on-court interview. “I’m really grateful to have the team I have. The people I have around me.

The Spaniard said that his struggles with the setback has made the win at Roland Garros all the more special for him. \"Obviously winning the U.S. Open (in 2022) when I reached for the first time the number one, something that I dreamt about since I started playing tennis, getting my first Grand Slam. So it was pretty special,\" Alcaraz said. \"The way I won Wimbledon (in 2023), beating Djokovic in five sets has been a great achievement for me. Right now, lifting the Roland Garros trophy, knowing everything I've been through the last month with the injuries and all, I don't know. \"Probably this is the moment I'm really proud about, because of everything I've done the last month just to be ready for this tournament with my team, a lot of talks with them.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story India's Sumit Nagal climbed 18 places to a career-best 77th in the latest ATP rankings issued on Monday, all but sealing a spot in the Paris Olympics men's singles draw. Nagal has 713 ATP points. The improvement in his rankings was due to Nagal bagging the men's singles crown at the Heilbronn Neckarcup 2024 Challenger event in Germany on Sunday, beating Switzerland's Alexander Ritschard in a three-set thriller. The Indian won 6-1 6(5)-7 6-3 in the final that lasted two hours and 22 minutes. Rankings, as on Monday, will be the basis for deciding entries for the Games. As per the established criteria, the top 56 players, both in men's and women's rankings, will attain automatic qualification for the Olympics but no more than four per country can make the cut for the Games, a rule which allows lower ranked players to sneak into the draw. Nagal looks good to secure the last available ranking-enabled spot in the draw. The last time India had a player in the Olympics main draw was the 2012 Games when Somdev Devvarman made it thanks to a wildcard. \"Elated to win the title in Heilbronn this week. It was an important week for me, and I'm proud to have produced my best tennis when it mattered the most,\" Nagal posted on X after his final win. \"If I win a match like this, I can be proud because the fight was insane. Ranking is secondary, first goal is to play good tennis,\" he said at the end of his match. The 26-year-old Nagal would be the sole Indian in the men's singles event in Paris. The International Tennis Federation will notify national federations about qualified athletes by June 12, following which National Olympic Committees will confirm their entries by June 19. This was the sixth ATP Challenger title for Nagal and the second of the year after the Chennai Open crown on home soil earlier this year. Nagal, who is currently the best-ranked Indian singles player, has won four ATP Challenger titles since 2023 and the win in Heilbronn was his fourth title on clay tennis courts."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The outgoing batch of students of the prestigious Dartmouth College in Hanover were treated to a special address by Roger Federer, who was the guest of honour at the graduation ceremony. Federer's speech, which lasted close to 30 minutes, has gone viral on social media, for all the right reasons. Drawing lessons from his decorated tennis career, Federer shared knowledge with the outing class, which overcame the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. Roger Federer also received an Honorary Doctorate at Dartmouth College on Sunday after which he delivered a speech for the ages. Calling them tennis lessons', Federer recalled learnings from his career and came up with one of the most entertaining graduation day speeches ever. From highlighting that nothing can be earned without hard work and effort, Federer said he was frustrated whenever people called him an 'effortless' tennis star. Federer reminded the outgoing batch of students that 'perfection is impossible' by throwing up stats from his career. Federer said he won 80 percent of his singles matches, but only 54 percent of the points in those games. \"So I never went to college. But I did graduate recently. I graduated tennis,\" Federer said, beginning his speech with a bang and making sure he had the attention of close to 11,000 audience who weathered a rain morning to meet and greet the tennis legend. \"I know the word is “retire.” “Roger Federer retired from tennis.” Retired... The word is awful. You wouldn’t say you retired from college, right? Sounds terrible. \"Like you, I’ve finished one big thing and I’m moving on to the next. \"Like you, I’m figuring out what that is. Graduates, I feel your pain,\" he added. Roger Federer retired from tennis in 2022 after winning as many as 20 Grand Slam crowns. The likes of Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal may have overtaken Federer in terms of the Grand Slams won in men's singles, but the Swiss great is regarded as the greatest ever by a large section of the tennis community. More often than not, Federer did not grind down opponents like Djokovic or outmuscle and outpower his foes like Nadal. Federer was known for his silky touch and the grace with which he outclassed opponents. His tennis was often called 'effortless'. However, Federer said he was frustrated whenever someone called his game 'effortless'. While explaining why, the legendary tennis player shared a personal anecdote and a great life lesson to the students at the gathering. \"Effortless is a myth. I mean it,\" Federer said. \"I say that as someone who has heard that word a lot. \"Effortless.\" \"People would say my play was effortless. Most of the time, they meant it as a compliment. But it used to frustrate me when they would say, \"He barely broke a sweat! \"Or \"Is he even trying?\" \"The truth is, I had to work very hard... to make it look easy. \"I spent years whining, swearing, throwing my racket before I learned to keep my cool. \"The wakeup call came early in my career, when an opponent at the Italian Open publicly questioned my mental discipline. He said, \"Roger will be the favorite for the first two hours, and then I'll be the favorite after that.\" \"I was puzzled at first. But eventually, I realised what he was trying to say. Everybody can play well the first two hours. You're fit, you're fast, you're clear... and after two hours, your legs get wobbly, your mind starts wandering, and your discipline starts to fade. \"It made me understand... I have so much work ahead of me, and I'm ready to go on this journey now. I get it. My parents, my coaches, my fitness coach, everyone had really been calling me out-and now even my rivals were doing it. Players!!! Thank you! I'm eternally grateful for what you did. \"So I started training harder. A lot harder. \"But then I realised that winning effortlessly is the ultimate achievement. \"I got that reputation because my warm-ups at the tournaments were so casual that people didn't think I had been training hard. But I had been working hard... before the tournament, when nobody was watching. Maybe you've seen a version of this at Dartmouth. \"How many times did you feel like your classmates were racking up \"A\" after \"A\" without even tryingâæ while you were pulling all-nighters... loading up on caffeineâæ crying softly in a corner of Sanborn Library? \"Hopefully, like me, you learned that effortless is a myth. \"I didn't get where I got on pure talent alone. I got there by trying to outwork my opponents. \"I believed in myself. But belief in yourself has to be earned,\" he added. Federer stressed the importance of looking beyond boundaries, in his third lesson: 'Life is bigger than the court'. \"Tennis has given me so many memories. But my off-court experiences are the ones I carry forward just as much... The places I’ve gotten to travel, the platform that lets me give back. and most of al the people I’ve met along the way. \"Tennis, like life, is a team sport. Yes, you stand alone on your side of the net. But your success depends on your team. Your coaches, your teammates, even your rivals... all these influences help to make you who you are. \"When I left tennis, I became a former tennis player. But you are not a former anything. You are future record-breakers and world travelersâæ future volunteers and philanthropists... future winners and future leaders. I am here to tell you from the other side of graduation that leaving a familiar world behind and finding new ones is incredibly, deeply, wonderfully exciting,\" he said. As expected, Federer was greeted by a huge round of cheers from the crowd after the entertaining and thought-provoking address. Like he did in tennis, he signed off in style, giving the audience a memory for a lifetime. The full speech by Roger Federer is available on the Dartmouth College website."

Nadal was knocked out in the first round of the French Open by Alexander Zverev and the Spaniard said he would try and be ready to feature in the Paris Olympics. Nadal did not feature in Wimbledon in 2023 after having reached the semi-final of the grass-court Grand Slam in 2022.

This remarkable achievement comes just a week after Nagal achieved his previous best ranking of 77. His impressive climb in the ATP rankings was propelled by his runner-up finish at the Perugia ATP Challenger tournament, which concluded on Sunday. The 26-year-old Nagal, who will be representing India as the sole participant in the men's singles event at the Paris Olympics, has accumulated a commendable 777 ATP points. His recent performances have bolstered his ranking and secured his qualification for the prestigious Olympic event. A series of notable performances have marked Nagal's journey this year. He began the year with a historic run at the Australian Open, where he reached the second round. Despite an early exit at the French Open, his resilience and skill were evident. He is now poised to compete in the main draw of Wimbledon, followed by the Paris Olympics at the iconic Roland Garros. Adding to his accolades, Nagal clinched the men's singles title at the Heilbronn Neckarcup 2024 Challenger event in Germany earlier this month. This victory followed his triumph at the Chennai Open in February. These victories are part of a broader pattern of success for Nagal, who has secured four ATP Challenger titles since 2023, with Heilbronn marking his fourth title on clay. Consistent and impressive performances have marked Nagal's rise to the top of Indian tennis. His success on the ATP Challenger circuit and his ability to perform on the biggest stages in tennis underscore his potential and determination. As the highest-ranked Indian singles player currently, Nagal's achievements serve as an inspiration for aspiring tennis players in the country."

The former world No. 2 shared the news on social media on Monday, citing the demanding tennis calendar as a primary reason. Jabeur, a three-time Grand Slam finalist, was considered one of Tunisia’s best hopes for a podium finish at the Olympics. \"After consulting with my medical team regarding attending the Olympics in Paris, we have decided that the quick change of surface and the body's adaptation required would put my knee at risk and jeopardize the rest of my season,\" she wrote in a statement. \"I have always loved representing my country in any competition, However, I must listen to my body and follow my medical team's advice. Wishing my teammates the best in the Games, and I will be their biggest supporter.\" In the 2020 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Tunisia celebrated two medals—a gold in swimming and a silver in taekwondo. Jabeur’s participation would have been anticipated to add to this success. Her decision to skip the event underscores the growing concern among top tennis players about the grueling tournament schedule. \"I prefer to have a little rest to make sure physically and health-wise I'm ready for the hard courts,\" she said in pre-tournament press at the ecotrans Ladies Open in Berlin. \"I'll have a good preparation before going to the hard-court season. I feel that this is safer and better for my body.\" pic.twitter.com/4lNTYAaKMA — Ons Jabeur (@Ons_Jabeur) June 17, 2024 Jabeur joins another former top-ranked player, Aryna Sabalenka, on the Olympic sidelines. Sabalenka, the reigning Olympic champion, also announced her withdrawal, highlighting scheduling challenges as a key factor. The tennis calendar has been increasingly taxing, with a quick shift from clay to grass between the French Open and Wimbledon, and then back to clay for the Olympic tennis event scheduled to take place on Roland Garros' clay courts from July 27. Jonathan Crane of DW in Berlin asked world No. 3 Sabalenka at the Ecotrans Ladies Open in Berlin about the difficulty of transitioning between surfaces within such a short period. Sabalenka confirmed she would not participate in the Olympics, emphasizing that something had to be sacrificed due to the packed summer schedule."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz began his grass-court season with a hard-working win at Queen's while Jannik Sinner was made to work hard on his debut match as the World No. 1 in Halle on Tuesday, June 18. The two men, who are likely to be the contenders-in-chief at Wimbledon next month, will be looking to build on the good start and go the distance in Halle and London. Carlos Alcaraz defeated World No. 26 Francisco Cerundolo in the ATP 500 tournament in London. This was the 21-year-old's first outing since winning the French Open earlier this month. Alcaraz was cruising toward a straight-set victory after sealing the opening set 6-1. However, his level dropped in the second set as he was trailing 2-5. Alcaraz then saved three set points when Cerundolo was serving for the set at 5-4. Alcaraz then found a new gear and won the match in straight sets. With the first-round win at Queen's Alcaraz extended his uneaten run on grass court to 13 matches. Alcaraz won the Queen's last year in a sensational run in which he dropped only one set. He then went on to win the Wimbledon crown, beating Novak Djokovic in the final. Meanwhile, World No. 1 Jannik Sinner was taken to the distance by Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor. Sinner was looking like he would lose his first match on grass this season, but he bounced back from a set down to beat Griekspoor 6-7(8), 6-3, 6-2. Sinner, who has won the Australian Open and reached the final of the French Open this year, reflected on a mentally challenging match in the first round in Halle. \"It was for sure mentally tough. I was 5-1 up in the tie-break in the first set. But this can happen, especially on this surface, it can go very, very fast. I think I was good mentally. I was struggling in the second set, 0/40 down on my serve. If he makes that point, it is even more difficult,\" Sinner said. \"But it's all about trying to get the confidence back, especially on this surface and I have shown that. Hopefully I can show some good tennis also in the next round.\" Sinner reached the semi-finals of Wimbledon last year."

Alcaraz was beaten in straight sets in an adrenaline-pumping match with the London crowd rooting for the local hero, who has been on a dream run on grass. The defeat ended Carlos Alcaraz's 13-match unbeaten run on grass that stretched from last year's Queen's. The Spaniard won the ATP 500 tournament in London before he won the Wimbledon crown last year. Alcaraz had survived a tough test in the opening round against Francisco Cerundolo earlier in the week and looked battle-ready for his title defence. However, Draper's ability was too good for the World No. 2. Carlos Alcaraz not defending his Queen's Club title will cost him the No. 2 spot as Novak Djokovic is all set to move one spot higher behind numero uno Jannik Sinner. Draper put on a serving masterclass, not dropping a service game as the left-hander's wide serves troubled Alcaraz. Draper wrapped up the match in an hour and 39 minutes. Jack Draper put on a near-flawless display to clinch the opening set in 58 minutes against top seed Alcaraz before going on to secure his biggest career win. The second set was a much more one-sided affair, with Draper making no mistake in front of his family who were at the stands, watching their young boy putting a show for the ages. \"It was a tough match. I knew coming out here Carlos is defending champion here, obviously won Wimbledon last year. He is an incredible talent and so amazing for the sport. So I had to come out and play really well and luckily I did today, so thank you.” he added. Jack Draper, who won the Stuttgart Open last week beating Matteo Berrettini in the final, will take on fifth seed Tommy Paul of the USA in the quarter-final of the Queen's Club."

This news was confirmed by his management team on Friday. The 3-time Grand Slam champion had to exit the London tournament after falling behind 4-1 in the first set against Australian player Jordan Thompson on Wednesday. The injury, which forced his withdrawal, marks yet another setback in Murray's storied career, one that has been fraught with physical challenges. Murray's decision to undergo a back procedure highlights the severity of his condition and underscores his commitment to returning to peak form. Fans and fellow players alike will be eagerly monitoring his recovery progress, hoping for a swift and successful return to the court. \"Andy is having a procedure on his back tomorrow. (Saturday) We will know more after this has taken place and will update further as soon as possible,\" a statement to British media said. The Guardian has revealed that Murray is set to undergo surgery. The renowned Scottish tennis star, who has secured two Olympic gold medals, mentioned earlier this year that continuing his career beyond this season seems unlikely. As Wimbledon quickly approaches, Murray faces a time crunch to regain his form and fitness for the prestigious event. At 37, Murray has suggested that retiring from professional tennis, either at this year's Wimbledon or the Paris Olympics, could mark a fitting end to his illustrious career. Wimbledon, a centrepiece in the tennis calendar, will take place from July 1 to 14. Conversely, the tennis events at the Paris Olympics are slated to begin shortly after, on July 27. This parallel timeline puts immense pressure on Murray, who must not only heal but also achieve peak performance. His possible retirement adds an emotional layer, as fans and fellow athletes brace to potentially witness the concluding chapters of a spectacular career that has inspired numerous young talents."

This marks his second appearance at the Olympics, following his debut at the 2020 Tokyo Games, where he reached the second round. Nagal expressed his excitement on social media, stating, \"Extremely glad to share that I have officially qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympics. This is a monumental moment for me as the Olympics holds a special place in my heart!\" He continued, \"One of my career highlights so far was participating in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Ever since then, Paris has been a big goal for me. Can’t wait to put my best foot forward.\" The All India Tennis Association (AITA) announced that Nagal's qualification was confirmed as per the ITF's rankings consideration on June 10, where he was listed as an alternate. In addition to Nagal's qualification, Rohan Bopanna and N Sriram Balaji will represent India in the men's doubles event at the Paris Games. Bopanna, a top-10 player, selected Balaji as his partner, a choice approved by the AITA. Nagal's qualification was bolstered by his recent victory at the Heilbronn Challenger earlier this month, which helped him break into the top 80 of the ATP singles rankings. This win was Nagal's second Challenger title of the season, following his triumph at the Chennai Challenger earlier this year. A post shared by Sumit Nagal (@nagalsumit) Nagal's qualification was confirmed due to the increasing number of withdrawals by higher-ranked players. The International Tennis Federation is set to release the official entry list on July 4, which will include Nagal. The tennis events at the Paris Olympics will be held at Roland Garros, the iconic venue of the French Open, from July 27 to August 4. At 26, Nagal becomes the second Indian player to qualify for the singles event in consecutive Summer Games editions since Leander Paes, who competed from 1992 to 2000. Paes won a bronze medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, marking India's second individual medal in the history of the quadrennial event. The 26-year-old has been making significant strides since the start of the 2024 season. He qualified for the main draw of the Australian Open, where he advanced to the second round with an impressive win over then-world number 37 Alexander Bublik. Additionally, he secured spots in the main draws of the Indian Wells Masters and Monte-Carlo Masters, both ATP 1000 events."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A new trailer for \"Deadpool and Wolverine' has dropped, and fans are buzzing with excitement. While the action-packed footage promises a hilarious and brutal team-up between the Merc with a Mouth and the Wolverine, eagle-eyed viewers might have spotted another sword wielding variant in the new trailer. The trailer, laced with Deadpool's signature fourth-wall-breaking humor, showcases the unlikely duo traversing what appears to be the Marvel multiverse. Sharp-eyed fans observed that a particular character, whose presence was previously not known, might have appeared in the trailer. Watch the trailer below: The character walking at the 30th second of the trailer looks like the Wade Wilson of another universe. This has led many fans to believe that the movie might be setting the stage for the introduction of Lady Deadpool, an alternate reality counterpart of the foul-mouthed anti-hero. Lady Deadpool, also known as Wanda Wilson, is a popular character from Marvel Comics. Sporting a similar red and black costume with a slightly different mask, she possesses similar regeneration abilities and a more strategic fighting style compared to Deadpool's chaotic brawling. The trailer's clever use of dialogue and the film's confirmed multiversal plot strongly suggest that Lady Deadpool might be more than just a rumour. Whether she appears as an ally, a rival, or simply a hilarious cameo remains to be seen, but one thing's for certain: 'Deadpool and Wolverine' promises to be a wild ride full of surprises."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 14 Jun, 2024 If you loved 'Inside Out', then brace yourself because the animated film returns with a more exciting chapter. Riley is back as a teenager and her emotions are going through an upheaval. Once controlled by simple emotions like 'joy', 'sadness', 'fear' and 'anger', the little girl is now close to hitting puberty now. Directed by Kelsey Mann, the sequel sees Riley at the brink of puberty struggling to embrace a whirlwind of new emotions she has been hit with. Suddenly, 'joy' is overthrown by the complex emotion of 'anxiety'. It doesn't come alone. 'Anxiety' comes with 'envy', 'embarrassment' and 'boredom.' But do not panic. Hah! Like 'anxiety' would let you! As Riley encounters newer challenges with teenage life, it is interesting to witness how Meg Fauve and Dave Holstein have worked on the screenplay. It's almost meta in several conversations that Riley's emotions have with each other. In one place, 'joy' is shown having a breakdown, claiming that she is 'delusional' and that it is not easy to stay positive all the time. I mean, we get it! We have all been there. It is in these moments that you really feel in sync with Riley. Here's the trailer: The writing is so relatable to every age group, even though Riley's emotions are considered new. 'Anxiety' taking over 'joy' is a reality and what stands out in Mann's directorial is that they aren't trying to brush any emotions aside. The journey is more focused on embracing it all and knowing that no one emotion can define you. You also have an adorable cameo by 'nostalgia' that's going to make you chuckle. Amy Poehler returns as the voice for 'joy' in the sequel and, boy, she is as joyful as ever. Maya Hawke gives voice to 'anxiety' and is impeccable. You have Phyllis Smith [sadness], and Lewis Black [anger] reprising their roles from the first film with Tony Hale giving voice for 'fear'. Liza Lapira replaces Mindy Kaling as 'disgust,' while Maya Hawke, Ayo Edebiri, Adèle Exarchopoulos, and Paul Walter Hauser are the new additions. Everyone comes together to make 'Inside Out 2' quite an eventful watch. The movie makes you feel vulnerable and joyful in equal measure. If you find yourself getting teary-eyed, you won't be alone. Riley's journey to embracing new emotions hits an emotional nerve on point. 'Inside Out 2' is your ideal weekend watch. Bonus - It's only an hour and a half long. 4 out of 5 stars for 'Inside Out 2'."

In an exclusive interview with IndiaToday.in, the actor spoke about visiting India, about feeling joy for the first time, and how she deals with anxiety. While talking to us, Amy shared how visiting India is on her bucket list. “Thank you to everyone in India who supports the film. We really hope you like the next one and I cannot wait to visit your country someday. It is on my bucket list of things to do so,” she said. Known for her vibrant and energetic performance, Poehler continues to bring depth and humour to the character, exploring new emotional adventures inside the mind of a now-teenage Riley. Speaking about what's her earliest memory of feeling joyful, Amy told India Today, “It probably was around candies or animals. When you’re a kid, you really cultivate joy a lot. You’re looking for fun. So, I think one of my memories was playing, and when the ice cream truck would give out ice cream and you hear the sound, that was just insane. I think it was the simple things that gave me joy.” The new film introduces new emotions to Riley, including ‘anxiety’. When asked what's her trick to deal with it, Amy added, “Anxiety brings in a lot of emotions and everyone wishes for it to go away, but it can’t, which is also the theme of the film. You can’t tell it to stop worrying, you can’t try to bypass it. You just have to say hello to it. Make some room for it and be like ‘thank you for service’ and then try to pull it away from the controls before it really makes you freeze.” A part from IndiaToday.in review read, “The movie makes you feel vulnerable and joyful in equal measure. If you find yourself getting teary-eyed, you won't be alone. Riley's journey to embracing new emotions hits an emotional nerve on point.” ‘Inside Out 2’ released in theatres on June 14."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Controversial actor Armie Hammer , who found himself at the centre of a sexual abuse scandal in 2021, recently opened up about what has transpired since then. Hammer also spoke about cannibalism allegations for the first time. Speaking to the Painful Lessons podcast, Armie Hammer said, \"People called me a cannibal, and everyone believed them. They’re like, ‘Yep, that guy ate people.' Like what? What are you talking about? Do you know what you have to do to be a cannibal? You have to eat people! How am I going to be a cannibal?! It was bizarre.” Hammer even laughed at the claims and called them 'hilarious.' Hammer was also accused of sexual abuse by numerous women in 2021 and the alleged messages he sent to them about his cannibalistic fantasies and other fetishes were leaked online, after which the actor was dropped from several projects and his agency. Speaking about how he feels today about that period in his life, the actor said, “I’m actually now at a place where I’m really grateful for it because where I was in my life before all of that stuff happened to me. It’s almost like a neutron bomb went off in my life. It killed me, it killed my ego, it killed all the people around me that I thought were my friends that weren’t — all of those people, in a flash, went away. But the buildings were still standing. I’m still here, I still have my health, and I’m really grateful for that.” Armie Hammer said that even though Hollywood would most likely not take him in future projects, he will continue to do cinema, and revealed that he is presently working on a script with a friend."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In the vibrant world of animated films, few have resonated as profoundly as Pixar’s 'Inside Out.' The original film, with its innovative exploration of emotions, personified within the mind of an 11-year-old girl named Riley, captured the complexities of growing up. Now, 'Inside Out 2' returns to this rich emotional tapestry, delving even deeper into the multifaceted experiences of adolescence and reminding us that despite the turmoil of emotions we endure, it is happiness that ultimately propels us forward. 'Inside Out 2' picks up Riley’s story as she navigates the stormy seas of her teenage years. The film introduces new characters representing a broader spectrum of emotions, such as anxiety, envy, ennui (a feeling of weariness), and embarrassment. These new additions highlight the increasingly complex emotional landscape that teenagers face. Anxiety manifests in Riley's worry about fitting in and meeting expectations. Envy emerges as she compares herself to her seemingly more successful or popular peers. Ennui captures the lethargy and disinterest that sometimes accompany the overwhelming pressures of growing up. Embarrassment becomes a frequent visitor as Riley grapples with her self-image and social faux pas. The inclusion of these new emotions makes Riley’s internal world more chaotic, mirroring the real-life experiences of many teenagers. The film deftly illustrates how these emotions can dominate one’s psyche, leading to periods of self-doubt and confusion. Anxiety and envy, in particular, can create a feedback loop that heightens stress and diminishes self-worth. Similarly, ennui can sap motivation and enthusiasm, while embarrassment can make social interactions feel perilous. The visual representation of these emotions in 'Inside Out 2' is both poignant and relatable, offering viewers a window into the challenges of adolescence. Yet, amid this emotional tempest, 'Inside Out 2' underscores a vital truth: happiness remains the cornerstone of our emotional well-being. The film poignantly portrays how moments of joy, however fleeting, have the power to illuminate even the darkest days. Riley’s interactions with friends, achievements in her hobbies, and simple pleasures in everyday life serve as beacons of happiness that guide her through her struggles. One of the film’s central messages is the resilience that happiness can foster. Despite facing anxiety about her future, envy of others, ennui towards her activities, and embarrassment from social blunders, Riley finds solace in the pockets of joy that punctuate her life. These moments of happiness are not grand or extraordinary; they are simple, everyday experiences that ground her and give her the strength to face another day. Despite the turmoil of these emotions, 'Inside Out 2' underscores the enduring presence of happiness. Joy, once again, plays a central role, reminding us that amidst all the emotional upheaval, moments of happiness give us the strength to move forward. Happiness in the film is not portrayed as a constant state but as fleeting, precious moments that make life worth living. This resonates with both teenagers and adults, who often find that the pursuit of happiness can be a driving force in their lives. Ultimately, 'Inside Out 2' is a poignant reminder of the enduring power of happiness. It teaches us that, no matter how many emotions we navigate—be it anxiety, envy, ennui, or embarrassment—happiness remains a vital force that motivates us to continue. The film’s portrayal of Riley’s emotional journey resonates with viewers of all ages, encouraging us to cherish and seek out the moments of joy that sustain us through life’s challenges. As we watch Riley find her way, we are reminded that happiness, however fleeting, is a powerful beacon that can guide us through even the most turbulent times."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Actor Ian McKellen is expected to make a full recovery after he toppled off a London stage during a fight scene and was hospitalised, producers said. McKellen, 85, was in \"good spirits\" after doctors said a scan showed he was expected to fully recover from the fall on Monday night, a spokesperson for the production at the Noel Coward Theatre said. Tuesday's performance was cancelled but McKellen was expected to be back onstage Wednesday, producers said. The stage and screen veteran, who played Gandalf in the 'Lord of the Rings' films, cried out in pain after the fall, according to a BBC journalist at the theatre. McKellen was playing the roguish John Falstaff in 'Player Kings', an adaptation of William Shakespeare's two 'Henry IV' history plays, directed by Robert Icke. Theatregoers were startled when McKellen lost his footing and fell off the stage in a scene with Toheeb Jimoh's Prince Hal and Henry Percy, played by Samuel Edward-Cook. \"Sir Ian seemed to trip as he moved downstage to take a more active part in the scene,\" audience member Paul Critchley told the PA news agency, saying it was a shock. \"He picked up momentum as he moved downstage which resulted in him falling off the stage directly in front of the audience,\" the staff and two doctors in the audience helped the actor, the theatre said in a statement. The theatre was evacuated, and the performance was cancelled. McKellen played Magneto in the 'X-Men' films and is one of Britain's most acclaimed Shakespearean actors, with roles including Richard III, Macbeth and King Lear. He has won a Tony Award — for 'Amadeus' — several Olivier Awards, and has been nominated for two Academy Awards, five Emmys and several BAFTA awards."

Reportedly shot before the couple started living separately, Affleck spoke about his wife, singer and actor Jennifer Lopez, and the crazy popularity that she has. He also addressed his ‘resting hard’ face when he faces paparazzi. Affleck mentioned Lopez a number of times during the episode. Speaking about the poipularity he enjoys, Ben Affleck mentioned, “We went somewhere with [Lopez] - I can't remember because she's so famous, and she creates this - people love her, and she really represents something important to people.” “[To me,] People are like, 'Hey, I like your movie,' and then they're like 'AAAHHHH! J-LO! It's amazing, you know what I mean?,” he told Hart with a smile. Recounting an incident when they, along with their children were mobbed at the Times Square, he said, “We get out with her, all the kids, through Times Square, and the s--t was like f--kin' bananas.” Affleck, JLo and everyone were getting late for a play and decided to take a walk to reach faster. Tha’s when people spotted Lopez and rushed to get a glimpse of her. “I was like, 'Oh my God.' There was a lady, she was smoking weed, in a full purple skintight suit -- she's a heavy lady -- and she starts running backwards filming, going 'J-LO!!' Like a herald, that then gets everyone else, and then all the tourists come in,” he recalled. “Then we've got our five kids, it's me and Jen and what feels like hundreds of people, and they're all screaming,” Affleck told Hart. He also addressed the face he puts up when he spots cameras around. Referring to it as the ‘resting hard face’, he said, “First of all, I'm also a little bit shy, I don't like a lot of attention. This is why people see me and they're like, 'Why's this dude always mad?’” Explaining that he doesn't like being photographed when he's with his children, he reasoned, “because somebody has their camera and stick it in my face and I'm like, 'Okay, here we go’.” Amid rumours of their divorce , Jennifer Lopez was seen holidaying in Italy. She flaunted her abs as she soaked in the sun. On Father's Day, she shared a message for Affleck ."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story There are not many films which can claim to entertain a wide variety of age groups. The Disney classic, The Lion King (1994), which released 30 years ago on June 15, is that rare example. Thirty years, and people still sing its songs, recall and recreate its classic moments (like Simba being lifted in the air). Clearly, we are dealing with something that is more than just a cartoon. All Disney's animated films of that era are usually looked back at with much fondness. However, The Lion King is in a league of its own, as it has been remade multiple times, including the 2019 photorealistic version directed by Jon Favreau. The Lion King was also released in Hindi, featuring a versatile voice cast that included names such as Shah Rukh Khan, Ashish Vidyarthi, Asrani, Shreyas Talpade and Sanjay Mishra, among others. Actor Shreyas Talpade, known for giving standout performances on screen, also brought back to life the iconic character of Timon from the feature, much to the delight of the Hindi-speaking audience. Speaking about the Disney original's remake, the actor exclusively told IndiaToday.in, \"The Hindi version also worked big time, and there were legendary actors to work with, including Shah Rukh Khan, Sanjay Mishra and Ashish Vidyarthi. And the one thing I genuinely enjoyed during the making of Lion King was the singing. I got to sing Hakuna Matata.\" Shreyas said the reason why he signed the movie was personal: \"One of the main reasons of doing Lion King was because my daughter was just one then, and I wanted her to relate to it, because her father has given the voice to one of the main characters. Today, she is six, and the Hakuna Matata song is on her playlist. She loves to listen to it. We even joke that I have been a part of Hans Zimmer's album, I have sung Hakuna Matata (laughs).\" The Lion King stands tall for numerous reasons. One, because of its technical brilliance, another, because the Roger Allens and Rob Minkoff directorial went on to earn a whopping $763 million, concluding its theatrical run as the highest grossing movie of the year. It also qualified as an all-time highest grosser, second only to Steven Spielberg's '93 release, Jurassic Park. Besides the commercial love it received, the Disney movie also earned praise from critics, winning two Academy Awards (for Best Original Score and Best Original Song). One of the things that people remember the most about The Lion King is its exquisite music. Composer Hans Zimmer earlier spoke to the Disney music team about the same and said that for him, The Lion King holds a special place in his heart, and not just because he composed its music. Speaking about the heart-wrenching death sequence of Mufasa, Zimmer said, \"A sort of profound blindside exists for me in The Lion King. I went into it thinking it is a cartoon, but then suddenly we are dealing with Mufasa's death scene, and it is a child dealing with the loss of his father. I had to deal with it then (the death of Zimmer's father), I had never dealt with it. So that moment was me, writing a requiem for my father, and so it became intensely personal. Which is really what all good music is supposed to be about.\" For many fans, watching The Lion King was a core part of their childhood. Nishita Sanyal, a content writer and a fan of the Disney film, told IndiaToday.in, \"It reminds me of simpler times and the powerful lessons I learned while sitting in front of the TV, wide-eyed and full of dreams. It's more than just a film; it's a cherished piece of my childhood that I carry with me always.\" Soumyajit Dasgupta, who works with IndiGo, loves The Lion King because it taught him to lead a 'carefree life', \"This movie taught me a very valuable aspect of leading life, which is to live things as they come, without any worries, a carefree circle of life.\" Speaking about the joy he got from bringing the riotous Timon to life, actor Shreyas Talpade opened up about his experience of dubbing for the character. \"It was the first time that I dubbed for any film ever. I had seen the original Disney, so I was excited to see how it would work out in the Hindi version. The way they wanted to me to depict Timon was quite fun, it was a little tapori-sh (rowdy). That perspective changed the way it was made. We would feel amused and happy with the whole take when we would compare it with the English one,\" said the actor. Speaking about the challenges of dubbing itself, Shreyas said, \"Voice-acting is tough, considering you are doing it in isolation, but it is also very musical. There is already a particular pitch to the original film and you just have to try and match that. I prefer to watch the film right before the dubbing begins to once again familiarise myself with that world.\" Timon was originally voiced by American actor Nathan Lane. One argument in favour of The Lion King's timeless appeal is also its beautiful, evocative drawings. The way its villain Scar was drawn still manages to send shivers down people's spines. Actor Ashish Vidyarthi, who voiced Scar in the Hindi version of the film, opened up about the challenges of dubbing for it. \"Scar is an iconic character and the experience of lending my voice to it was extraordinary. It was also challenging to bring alive something which had already been done so long ago. It was written very well, the original English version. But then to bring the menace and the music of it to the Hindi version presented a unique challenge. Initially, they had called me to sing for it, the song 'Hoon Tayyar.' While I was doing that, they suggested why don't I do the complete voiceover for Scar and I said, why not?\" Ashish told IndiaToday.in. A still from The Lion King. The legacy of The Lion King is unending. It has been recreated in forms of memes, musicals and of course, movies. Indian animator Vishwajeet, of Hi-tech animation, Kolkata spoke to IndiaToday.in about how The Lion King left a lasting impression on his mind, so much so that he ended up including his learnings from it in his own projects. \"The first animation I watched was Disney's The Lion King. All I remember thinking is 'I had never seen such a film before.' We learned all the tricks of animation, the storytelling technique from Disney movies like Lion King. It left an indelible impression on my mind, especially the antagonist Scar, that character really scarred me (laughs). I studied their works and tried to implement it in my projects,\" said Vishwajeet. Thirty long years since the release, but the film still doesn't look dated. That could be another reason for its relevance. Actor Shreyas Talpade spoke about the movie's long legs and said, \"I mean I still remember how amazed I was when I saw it for the first time. The technical brilliance they were able to achieve back then, and it doesn't look dated at all even when you watch it now.\" Rafiki once said in The Lion King many years ago, \"Oh yes, the past can hurt. But from the way I see it, you can either run from it or learn from it.\" But in case of the Disney feature, there is nothing to grieve about (with the exception of Mufasa's tragic death). There are only things to enjoy and cherish, like Rafiki's line right here."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Who says studying overseas is expensive? With so many scholarships available for international students, your dream of studying abroad is within easy reach. Almost every country that is exporting education has rolled out coveted scholarship awards if you qualify. It must be mentioned here that any economy that wants to grow cannot afford to lose the best of minds. These scholarships are a way to say that if you have got the talent you are most welcome here. Applications that carry consistently strong academic records, letters of recommendation from teachers and demonstrate teamwork and leadership skills, are picked up instantly to be awarded scholarships. Let's know more from the expert Rohit Sethi, Director, ESS Global. High-achieving students across various disciplines aspiring to study in the UK are offered several prestigious scholarships, including the Commonwealth Shared Scholarship Scheme. It assists students with excellent academic performance and benefits them as they pursue higher education in the UK. These students are not able to study in the UK due to financial constraints. Chevening is an international scholarship programme from the UK government. To avail of this scholarship, an applicant must submit one unconditional UK university offer, education documents and references. The fully-funded Chevening Scholarships cover the following expenditures: university tuition fees, a monthly stipend, travel costs to and from the UK, and the cost of one visa application. Scholarships are one way to bridge the gap between the cost of attendance and need-based financial requirements. Highly motivated individuals who demonstrate outstanding qualities and remarkable work experience can be rewarded through Fellowships for Indian Students provided by the United States-India Educational Foundation. There are other university-specific merit-based scholarships available for Indian students aspiring to study in the US. These options include the Stanford Graduate School of Business Need-Based Fellowship which offers financial aid to MBA students regardless of their citizenship. In the majority of the scholarship options that are available for international students, one does not have to apply specifically for them. Students are automatically considered for scholarships when they apply for a programme, and if they have already shown their calibre the benefit will be accorded to them. With that being said, how can you be a magnet for scholarships so that these rewards come to you? Show that you are a dedicated student, as good academic records are the starting point to be considered for scholarships for studying in any country. This is something that will take its own time to accomplish, and there is no shortcut. The next checkpoint is how well you score on tests like IELTS, TOEFL and SAT. A high score here affects how good your application will look. You are good at proving yourself, but how good others consider you will also be an important determining factor. Recommendation letters from teachers and professors will add glitter to your credibility. A well-written essay is your chance to talk about your plans and ambitions. Your current qualifications should align with the goals mentioned in the essay and should look convincing and practical enough. Sports and extracurricular achievements of the students will also be considered as applications are evaluated for scholarships. Such achievements show that a student has been highly active during school time, likes to engage in multiple tasks and has demonstrated well-rounded skills. It is like an extra topping in the already long list of achievements that the student has and creates a profile that makes it impossible to be denied a scholarship. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} Showing that you are good enough to be granted a scholarship is important and it requires proper preparation. While submitting your application for admission to a given programme note the specific requirements that the scholarship category asks. There is no one-size-fits-all solution here."

She always managed to connect with them on a deeper level, unlocking their hidden potential and making learning a pleasure instead of a chore. This conviction shaped her philosophy that every child possesses an innate ability to learn and thrive when provided with an environment that is supportive, stimulating, and safe. A few years later, as a young adult and new mother in America, she had a chance to put all her theories into practice as she raised her first child. She quickly realized the transformative power of early brain stimulation and positive parenting. Her son reached milestones well ahead of his peers, garnering attention as the youngest MENSA member in the country at age 2. Elaborating on the huge turning point of this personal parenting approach becoming a larger mission, Grace says, \"We were flooded with interview requests after he participated in MENSA and the line of questioning about him being 'gifted' made me realize that this is a huge societal misconception. Sure, he is a bright child, but I believe that each child is, and they all have their own unique strength. It is truly up to the parent to tap into them and help unleash the genius within by providing enriching learning experiences and fostering meaningful connections.\" This realization eventually led her to create the Genius Nurturer Community, a thriving support network focused on whole-brain acceleration and the six key developmental areas for children aged 0-7. Having studied at Stanford School of Medicine, Harvard, and the Positive Discipline Association, Grace has guided over 7,000 parents and educators worldwide in unlocking their child's inner genius. Her courses empower parents to become \"genius nurturers,\" emphasizing that a child's development is deeply influenced by positive learning experiences, emotional growth, and holistic nurturing. Grace believes that every parent can raise a happy, fulfilled child by fostering a supportive environment through community and awareness. Her approach isn't just about \"what\" to teach children but about \"how\" to nurture them effectively. Grace says, \"In every child, there lies a potential for greatness. Our role as parents and educators is to create an environment where this potential can be fully realized.\" Grace Riyas The Baby Genius Framework Grace's signature program, The Baby Genius Framework, is a comprehensive course designed to accelerate learning and unlock the full potential of young children. The program takes a holistic approach to foster multiple intelligence and build skills including photographic memory, speed reading and decoding, intuitive and mental math, encyclopedic knowledge, creative arts, advanced language skills, athleticism, perfect pitch, logic and reasoning, intuition, increased focus and concentration, emotional intelligence, strong parent-child bonding, among others! .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} Grace Riyas's Genius Nurturer Community is a thriving network of parents and educators dedicated to fostering the development of young children. Grace's journey is a testament to the power of challenging conventions and believing in the innate genius of every child. Through her work, she continues to inspire and empower parents and educators worldwide, proving that with the right approach, every child can reach their full potential."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story From the prestigious classrooms of the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) to the dynamic world of startups, IITians are redefining the entrepreneurial landscape. Renowned for their technical prowess and innovative thinking, IIT graduates are spearheading ventures that span diverse sectors such as technology, healthcare, education, and finance. Their startups are not just disrupting traditional markets but are also providing solutions to global challenges, including sustainable energy and advanced AI applications. The rigorous training and resilient mindset cultivated at IITs empower these entrepreneurs to navigate the complexities of the startup ecosystem, from securing funding to scaling their operations. The success stories of IIT alumni inspire a new generation of innovators, reinforcing the role of IITians as pivotal drivers of change and progress. As they continue to break new ground, the influence of IITians on the global entrepreneurial stage is both significant and transformative. Siddhant Jain, CEO, VdoCipher I started working on my company VdoCipher during my college time and had paying customers before I graduated. The 8 year old company currently caters to 3000+ businesses across 120+ countries and is profitable. Having a network of smart students as friends and co-workers helps you to think about problem-solving in a more deeper manner. There are no prejudices on what kind of work one can do and one can not do. The success of past IIT-based entrepreneurs is also aways a motivation and some of them do come as speakers and mentors during the startup-related events in the college. Though Flipkart and Zomato are some of most popular companies to have come out of IIT Alumni in past decade or more; but many other B2B tech or core tech startups have been founded by IIT alumni and doing great. If someone is working on biotech or deep tech products, then IIT technology centres also help in research and collaboration aspects. IITs also get a good amount of funding from previous successful entrepreneurs. For example, Nandan Nilekani and Vinod Khosla donated handsome amounts to their respective IITs. Coming to my own journey of starting up, my co-founder and most of our initial team members were our batchmates. Some of IIT alumni also helped us in connecting us with potential investors and partners. Our first public demo was at a startup event in IIT Delhi. Since, our potential customer base also comprised of e-learning platforms, having good academic background as founders also helped build initial trust amongst customers. But I will like to point out that, eventually it is about your product or service adding high value to the customer, and college does not matter beyond a point. Anshuman Das, CEO and Founder, LONGHOUSE Consulting \"Career preferences of IIT graduates have evolved significantly, driven by economic changes, success stories, institutional support, and technological advancements. In the late 90s and early 2000s, IIT graduates primarily sought high-paying jobs in multinational corporations, particularly in sectors like technology, finance, and consulting. Many also pursued further studies at leading global universities to enhance their international career prospects. Subsequent years saw a technology sector boom that created numerous opportunities for startups. Success stories of IIT alumni, such as the founders of Flipkart, Ola, and Zomato, inspired many students. The rise of venture capital and angel investing in India provided the necessary financial support for startups. IITs also began attracting more startups for campus placements. Increased institutional support, such as accelerators and incubators, along with a cultural shift towards high risk-taking attitudes and peer inspiration, encouraged students to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities. Entrepreneurship is no longer limited to tech startups. IIT graduates are venturing into diverse fields such as healthcare, education, renewable energy, and social enterprises.\" Shalu Mitruka, Co-Founder, Growthpal \"After graduating from IIT Kharagpur and completing my MBA from IIM Lucknow, I worked at MindTickle and Deloitte, and consulted for more than 18 healthcare portfolio companies at Villgro Innovations Foundation and Venture Center, Pune. My experience in these roles fueled my passion for entrepreneurship and led me to co-found Growthpal with Maneesh Bhandari. Our mission was to build and expand the exit ecosystem for Indian founders by creating a data-driven, programmatic AI and technology-led investment banking platform that facilitates small and mid-size acquisitions. At Growthpal, we've collected data on nearly 3 million small to mid-sized companies across India, the US, and Southeast Asia. By disrupting the traditional investment banking approach, we've managed to close multiple deals, including cross-border transactions, and tripled our revenues in the last year alone. One of our proudest achievements is helping a client close seven deals recently. A key value add that we've pioneered at Growthpal is leveraging our data-driven platform to bring off-the-market deals to the table. These are unique opportunities not caught in bidding wars, allowing buyers to be the first to talk to sellers and build organic relationships. This approach has allowed us to build a strong pipeline of opportunities beyond just inbound leads or banker referrals. Growthpal has built over 150 curated M&A pipelines, discussed offers worth over $1.3 billion, and delivered more than 1,500 'Ready to Transact' targets.\" Aditya Kumbakonam, COO & Cofounder, MathCo \"My journey from IITM to building MathCo has been nothing short of transformative and filled with learnings. It all began at IIT-Madras, where I met my now co-founder, Anuj Krishna. As engineering students, Anuj and I were curious and ambitious, though starting a company wasn't initially on our radar. IITM, however, imparted lessons far beyond the classroom. It equipped us with more than just technical skills; it instilled in us a way of life- teaching us the importance of independence, the courage to take risks, and the ability to continuously adapt and thrive in uncertainty. At IIT, we learned to think critically and embrace a spirit of innovation and resilience. These experiences laid the foundation for what was to come. After graduating, my first job was a pivotal turning point. Coincidentally, Anuj and I joined the same company, where we faced real business challenges and applied our theoretical knowledge to practical solutions. This exposure made us realize that businesses often grapple with generic, one-size-fits-all solutions and need bespoke approaches tailored to their unique infrastructure, culture, and goals. Here, we shared a vision of solving tough problems for some of the largest enterprises in the world to address the unique challenges in areas of supply chain, marketing and digital. This shared vision became the bedrock of MathCo. Together with Anuj and Sayan, we set on a journey to build a company that focuses on understanding and solving complex business problems. Our mission was clear: to create custom, data-driven solutions that empower businesses to succeed in their unique environments. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} From the collaborative learning experience at IIT to the constant innovation at MathCo, I have been fortunate to find myself surrounded by like-minded individuals who are passionate about problem-solving and driven to make an impact. For me, building MathCo goes beyond just creating a business; it's about creating a culture that questions the status quo, while helping organizations realize tangible benefits from AI.\""

Integrating music into the curriculum offers numerous advantages, enriching students' academic experiences and supporting their holistic development. Music transcends being just an art form; it is a powerful catalyst for growth, emotional well-being, and personal development. When schools incorporate music into their teaching frameworks, they unlock a medium that enhances cognitive abilities and fosters emotional resilience. Music allows students to explore their creativity, express their emotions, and build the confidence needed to face life’s challenges. As educators, we must nurture not only the intellectual capabilities of our students but also their emotional and social well-being. Music engages various parts of the brain, facilitating improvements in memory, attention, and problem-solving skills.

For instance, a study by the National Association for Music Education found that students involved in musical activities typically achieve higher scores in mathematics and reading, reflecting music's positive impact on cognitive development. On this World Music Day, we celebrate the transformative impact of music on our lives. Let's get more deep into this by having some insights from Radhika Sinha, Principal, Aditya Birla World Academy, Mumbai. Enhancing Cognitive and Academic Skills- Music engages multiple areas of the brain, improving memory, attention, and problem-solving. Students involved in music education programs often achieve higher scores in mathematics and reading. Boosting Emotional Well-Being- Music reduces stress and anxiety, creating a calm learning atmosphere.

Fostering Skill Development and Creativity- L earning music requires discipline, teamwork, and creative expression. Activities like song writing and improvisation stimulate innovative thinking and collaboration. Building a Positive and Inclusive Classroom Environment - Music connects people across cultural and social barriers, fostering community and trust. It helps build bonds between teachers and students, enhancing engagement and performance. Promoting Emotional Resilience and Coping Mechanisms- Music provides a therapeutic outlet for emotions, helping students manage stress. Integrating music into the curriculum supports emotional expression and resilience. Conclusion .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} As we commemorate World Music Day, let us embrace the transformative power of music in education.

    "title": "Balancing academic expectations and your child’s well-being: A compassionate approach - India Today",
    "published_date": "2024-06-21",
    "author_name": "India Today Information Desk",
    "author_url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/author/india-today-information-desk",
    "article_content": "Listen to Story In today's competitive school environment, parents frequently face the difficult issue of balancing their children's academic performance with their overall well-being. The pressure to succeed academically can be stressful, and while high expectations can motivate children to do their best, they must avoid harming their mental and emotional health. Here are some effective techniques for maintaining this delicate balance while considering each child's individual needs and emotions. All you need to know from the expert Dr. Neelima Kamrah, Principal KIIT World School Gurugram. 1. UNDERSTANDING THE PRESSURE The first step in maintaining a balance between well-being and academic demands is identifying the pressure points. These may originate from classmates, parents, schools, or the kids themselves. Parents aspire to the best for their kids, believing that they will excel academically, gain admission to esteemed universities, and eventually launch successful careers. But it's important to keep in mind that every child is different, with their special skills, passions, and stress tolerance. 2. OPEN AND HONEST COMMUNICATION It's essential for creating an atmosphere of open communication. Encourage your child to talk to you about the challenges they have in school and their academic lives. Actively listen without passing judgement while being caring and understanding. This method improves your bond with them while also helping you determine their level of stress. \"How are you feeling about your schoolwork?\" or \"Is there anything specific that's making you feel stressed?\" are examples of open-ended questions to use. By asking these kinds of questions, you can encourage your child to talk to you about their worries and get the help they need. 3. SETTING REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS While motivating your child to aim for excellence is crucial, it's just as important to help them create reasonable and achievable goals. Stress levels and feelings of inability might result from unrealistic expectations. Stress the value of work, progress, and a passion for learning rather than just grades. Assist your child in creating straightforward objectives that are achievable and acknowledge their successes. If possible, encourage them to pursue new interests or do better in tricky subjects rather than aim for a perfect grade. 4. ENCOURAGING A BALANCED LIFESTYLE An all-around healthy lifestyle is essential for a child's development. Encourage your kids to participate in extracurricular activities like sports, the arts, or hobbies in addition to academics. Engaging in these activities can offer an important break from academics, reduce stress, and promote the growth of multiple skills and passions. Make sure your kids have relaxation and enjoyment. Children need rest to refuel and return to their studies with greater energy and concentration. 5. PRIORITISING MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH Mental and emotional well-being should never be sacrificed for academic achievement. Keep an eye out for any psychological, sleep, or eating abnormalities in your child that might indicate stress, anxiety, or depression. Take these indicators carefully and think about getting help from a school counsellor or mental health specialist if you encounter any of them. Instruct your kids in stress management techniques, including writing, deep breathing, and mindfulness. They can keep a healthy mental state and control their emotions with the help of these methods. 6. CREATING A SUPPORTIVE HOME ENVIRONMENT A supportive family life can make a big difference in a child's capacity to handle pressure from school. Take an interest in their homework, be available to assist when required, and create a calm, well-organised study area. Their inspiration and confidence might increase with your support and involvement. Avoid comparing your child to peers or siblings. Since every child is different, making comparisons can lead to feelings of competitiveness and failure. Instead, highlight each person's unique abilities and skills. 7. MODELING HEALTHY BEHAVIOUR Children learn basic information by seeing their parents. Set an example of good behaviour by keeping a balanced lifestyle, learning how to handle stress, and putting your health first. Show children that it's acceptable to take pauses, ask for assistance when necessary, and acknowledge one's successes. Talk about your personal experiences managing stress and the value of taking care of yourself. This openness can teach your child that asking for assistance is acceptable and that facing difficulties is a natural part of life. 8. ENCOURAGING A GROWTH MINDSET Motivate your child to have a growing attitude by promoting the importance of hard work, dedication, and making mistakes. Honour their devotion and dedication more than their success. They might see hurdles as opportunities for development rather than as barriers if they adopt this mentality. Motivate them to set objectives for themselves and evaluate their achievements. By encouraging a sense of pride in their achievement and ownership, this technique can help kids become more motivated by themselves. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} Balancing school expectations with your child's well-being helps them succeed and stay happy. By talking openly, setting realistic goals, encouraging a balanced lifestyle, and prioritising mental health, you support their overall growth. Your love and guidance help them handle life's challenges with strength and confidence."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The journey of overseas education is not an easy one. When one considers the chance of foreign yet practical education, there is a list of challenges that are always there. In addition to finding the perfect course, university, financial aid, and a place to live abroad, there are minor yet critical challenges like feeling homesick, planning and procedure of getting into your dream college, writing acceptable SOPs, and most importantly, clearing your English proficiency test. Preparing for English proficiency exams is a crucial stepping stone for study abroad aspirants; however, with the correct approach and support, you can easily fulfil your goal of overseas education. For many, pursuing international education is a lifelong dream. Whether seeking a world-class education or building a future abroad, proficiency in English is a crucial step towards achieving this goal. However, studying abroad comes with its challenges, and preparing for English language proficiency exams is a significant milestone to achieve. With various tests such as IELTS and TOEFL, it is essential to know which exam is required for which destination. Each test has its unique format, content, and scoring system and understanding these differences is vital to achieving success. How To Prepare for IELTS, TOEFL Exams? Preparing for any exam is an overwhelming task. The stress and burden of preparing constantly for an exam because the foundation of a better future depends on how well you perform in the exams. Like every other exam, the English language proficiency tests are overwhelming too; however, with the correct strategy, you can easily crack your IELTS or TOEFL exam. This section is your ultimate step-by-step study guide to help you prepare for your English language proficiency test without worrying about anything. So, without further waiting, let’s start with the plan suggested by Rishi Vikram Josan, Country Head – Franchise at MetaApply. 1. Know the Test and Format: The first and foremost step you should begin with when you start your preparations for the English language proficiency test is to know the test and format completely. Having a complete knowledge of what you are going to face in the exam will help you to prepare in a better manner. As you know there are four sections in IELTS and TOEFL exams, reading, writing, listening, and speaking, each of the sections contains different numbers of questions and timing. To be able to crack your English proficiency exams, you must familiarise yourself with the test type, the format, and even the type of questions that can be asked. 2. Set a Clear Goal: The next step you must follow in the process of IELTS preparation is to set a clear goal. As you know there are different band scores for IELTS, TOEFL, DET, etc., so it is better you know what band score you want to achieve. Indeed, any English language exam is solely needed for an institution or organisation, when you know exactly what band score is required to get in there, it becomes easier for you to focus on your test prep. A decided goal like the minimum TOEFL or IELTS score will help you in preparing for the exam, whether you need 8 weeks or 90 days to prepare for your exam. 3. Develop a Study Plan: Once you have set the goal for your IELTS or TOEFL exam and know the exam format, the next step is to develop a study plan. For efficient learning, try setting realistic study goals. You should begin by creating a timetable and dividing different time slots to practice the different English language skills. Sometimes, when you see the entire module all at once, it can be an overwhelming task, leading you to procrastinate. To be able to study efficiently, you should practice daily and instead of sitting for five hours straight, opt for the Pomodoro technique where you study for a while and then take a break. 4. Enhance Each Skill: As you know there are four sections in the English language proficiency test, mainly reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Based on your abilities, you will know how much time you need to invest in practicing the asked skills. Knowing that you must be fluent in each of the sections for a comfortable stay abroad, it is better if you practice every day. For some efficient tricks, you can use the morning time for reading and writing. When it comes to listening and speaking, you can use any time of the day to listen to more English content, besides that, try thinking and communicating in English for fearless English speaking. 5. Take Mock Test: Finally, the only thing that will make you test-ready is when you take as many mock tests as possible. To know the format of an exam is good, but to know what kind of questions you will be answering gives you a better understanding of the exam. So, in your IELTS preparation timeframe, it is better you not only work on the betterment of your skills but also take as many mock tests as you can. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} This will not only help you to know what kind of questions you will be facing, but how you can finish your exam within the allotted time. The mock test will help you figure out what your weaknesses are and how you can make them your strengths."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Meril Life Sciences, an India-based global medical device company, recently conducted a trial study titled 'Comparison of Early Outcomes of Newer-Generation Myval Transcatheter Heart Valve Series with Contemporary Valves (Sapien and Evolut) THV Series in Real-World Individuals with Severe Symptomatic Native Aortic Stenosis: A Randomised Non-Inferiority Trial'. The LANDMARK randomized controlled trial for the MYVAL THV series has been published in The Lancet, a prestigious medical journal. Dr. Ashok Seth , Chairman- Fortis Escorts Heart Institute said The' Landmark Trial ' has been been a meticulously conducted prospective international study which met the highest scientific prerequisites and therefore the results have been appreciated by Interventional cardiology community across the world. We are proud that Myval , Transcatheter heart valve which has been researched and developed in India, has proven itself to be as good and in some ways even better than the conventionally used Transcatheter heart valves from the west. This is a major step forward for the Indian Device industry and Medical Community because it addresses the effectiveness , availability and affordability of this life saving treatment TAVI , not just for numerous patients in india but across the world. This pivotal research compares early outcomes of the new-generation Myval THV series with contemporary (Sapien and Evolut) THV series in real-world patients suffering from severe symptomatic native aortic stenosis (AS). The findings highlight that the Myval THV series is non-inferior to global giants. Occurrence of primary composite endpoint which is composite of deaths, stroke, major bleeding, acute kidney injury, major vascular complications, moderate or severe valve regurgitation, and the need for new permanent pacemaker implantation as per the third Valve Academic Research Consortium consensus) with no difference in the itemized components of the primary composite endpoints (24.7% Myval THV series vs. 27.0% Contemporary THV series, p<0.0001 statistically significant non-inferiority). This significant achievement underscores the success of the \"Make in India'' initiative, proving India's capability to set new standards in cardiovascular care and revolutionize heart valve treatment worldwide. As per the Global Principal Investigator, Prof. Andreas Baumbach, \"The Landmark trial showed that the Myval THV series performed as safely and effectively as contemporary THV series. It is a valve made for everyday clinical practice and an all-comers population. The special feature of intermediate diameters allows for more accurate sizing, which has the potential to translate into improved long-term outcomes. Our patients will be followed up for 10 years and it will be interesting to see the long-term results in the three treatment arms.\" The Myval THV series is a novel THV that comes in various size options compared to the currently available THVs, making it easier to find the right fit for different patients. It is available in a wide range of sizes, including traditional sizes (20 mm, 23 mm, 26 mm, and 29 mm), intermediate sizes (21.5 mm, 24.5 mm, and 27.5 mm), and larger sizes (30.5 mm and 32 mm). This extensive range ensures that more patients can receive a valve that closely matches their anatomical needs, potentially improving outcomes and making advanced heart valve treatment more accessible to a broader population. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} The team had also enrolled patients with more complicated cases, such as those with small aortic valve sizes and bicuspid valves, which have only two leaflets instead of the usual three. The Myval THV series produced a greater valve opening (known as effective orifice area (EOA)) for blood flow into the aorta compared to the Sapien THV series in several diameters. However, the Myval THV series produced a similar valve opening to the Evolut THV series. Intermediate sizes of the Myval THV series allowed for better matching of the THV to each patient's aortic valve size, with 48% of all Myval THV series implants in the trial being intermediate-sized THVs. Further patient follow-up over ten years will provide more information about the long-term effects and durability of the THVs."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The central government on Friday notified the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024, which aims to prevent unfair means in public examinations and common entrance tests held across the country. The move comes amid the massive row over the alleged malpractices in conducting the NEET and UGC NET examinations. The law, which was passed by the Parliament in February this year , proposes a punishment of a minimum of three to five years of imprisonment to curb cheating and for those involved in organised crimes of cheating will face five to 10 years of imprisonment and a minimum fine of Rs 1 crore. If a person or a group of persons commits an organised crime, including the examination authority, service provider, or any other institution, they will be punished with imprisonment for a term not less than five years but which may extend to ten years, and a fine not less than Rs 1 crore, the law states. The law also has provisions to attach and forfeit the property of an institution if they are found involved in an organised paper leak crime, and the proportionate cost of the examination shall also be recovered from it. However, the act protects the candidates appearing in the examination from the punitive provisions, and they will be governed under the provisions of the existing unfair means policy of the examination conducting authority. The law defines 'unfair means' as leaking question papers or answer keys, assisting candidates during exams through unauthorised communication or providing solutions, tampering with computer networks or resources, impersonating candidates, conducting fake examinations or issuing fake documents, and tampering with documents for merit lists or ranks. The offences that come under the law are non-bailable. Any officer not below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police or Assistant Commissioner of Police can investigate any offence under the Act. Additionally, the central government has the power to refer any investigation to a central agency. The Act covers examinations held by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), the Staff Selection Commission, the Railways, banking recruitment examinations, and all computer-based examinations conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA). Informing about the implementation of the bill on X, Union Minister Giriraj Singh said, \"The Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024—the anti-paper leak law for examinations for central recruitment and entrance into central educational institutions—came into effect on Friday, June 21.\""

The protests have seen significant activity in cities such as Bhopal, Hyderabad, Itanagar, Kanpur, and Jhansi, where activists have taken to the streets and burnt effigies to voice their demands. The primary issue driving the ABVP's protests is the demand for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry into the NEET-UG (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test-Undergraduate) examination. The ABVP alleges that there is considerable evidence of paper leaks available publicly and insists that strict action is necessary to address these concerns. The organisation is calling for the implementation of stringent laws to prevent future paper leaks and for severe penalties for those involved in cheating and corruption related to the exams. They argue that such measures are essential to safeguard the integrity and credibility of the examination process, which is critical for students' futures. Protesters have expressed frustration with the NTA, accusing it of negligence and corruption, which they believe jeopardises students' academic and professional futures. The ABVP has made it clear that their demonstrations will persist until their demands are addressed satisfactorily. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} The protests highlight a growing call for a thorough and unbiased investigation by the NTA and other relevant authorities to ensure accountability and transparency in the examination process."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Indian students constitute one-fourth of all foreign students in the United States, with a predominant representation from eastern regions, including the northeast. US Consul Melinda Pavek highlighted that a substantial number of Indian students, particularly from the eastern states, are set to form the largest contingent heading to US universities this year. “Thousands of students from eastern India are part of the largest-ever Indian delegation to the US this year,” stated Pavek, highlighting the growing educational ties between the two nations. This announcement came during the 8th Annual Student Visa Day, emphasising the pivotal role of Indian students in the US educational landscape. “The top four student visa processing posts in the world were all right here in India last year, as we issued more visas than in 2018, 2019 and 2020 combined,” a statement issued by the US Embassy said. Pavek reiterated that facilitating student visas remains a priority, underscoring the importance of accessible educational opportunities. Pavek noted a diverse academic interest among Indian students in the US, with a keen focus on fields like computer science, machine learning, AI, engineering, chemistry, and physics. This trend reflects Indian students' increasing pursuit of cutting-edge disciplines in American universities. US Consul Pavek also addressed concerns regarding visa issues and student deportations, affirming the US's commitment to accommodating genuine students and avoiding unnecessary hardships. She stressed the value of education over prestige, cautioning against undue financial burden on families for Ivy League aspirations. “I would hate the prospect of a student mortgaging family fortune to study in an Ivy League school. The emphasis should be rather on the degree,\" she noted. The US Consular Team interviewed more than 3,900 student visa applicants across the country during the daylong event on Thursday. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} (With PTI inputs)"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The idea of studying abroad is not new among the Indian scholars. As a matter of fact, the foreign enrollments are rapidly surging every year. In 2022, the Ministry of External Affairs reported that 13,24,954 Indians went out to 79 countries to pursue their higher education in foreign lands. Despite the substantial shift in diplomatic relations with other countries, the trends of overseas education are altering every year. In addition to this, regulations of immigration policies by different countries will be a boon to Indian students. Here are some changing trends that I, as a founder, noticed in the past four years. Indiatoday.in spoke to Mamta Shekhawat, founder of Gradding.com regarding Study abroad trends. AI Integration with Curriculum - The blend of artificial intelligence after COVID-19 is continuously influencing the number of enrollments in foreign universities. Everybody wants to be well-versed with edge-cutting technology. Moreover, virtual reality [VR] and augmented reality [AR] will play a crucial role in delivering alluring education to abroad aspirants. In simple words, the students would be able to experience real-life examples with these technologies. Increase in Number of Colleges - The past 4 years have seen an increase in colleges welcoming foreign students. Furthermore, the arrival of international scholars is linked with many benefits, like GDP growth, rising profits and a multi-cultural society. So, every country is encouraging foreign admissions to balance the losses incurred due to COVID-19. Rise in Scholarships and Aids - The universities in foreign lands are now recognising global talent and potential. So, to encourage these pupils, the government and the universities are providing grants to support their education and living expenses. Many countries also collaborate with the Indian government in order to motivate Indians for admission in their land. Bridge Programs for Foreign Students - The students face many problems as soon as they land in the host countries. These start from the different accents of the local people to cultural immersion. The universities are coming up with bridge programs to overcome this problem. It helps the aspirants to know their environment better and they feel less alienated. The phenomenon of studying abroad allows Indian students to broaden their horizons and the scope of their future. However, it lets them explore different cultures, traditions, and perspectives. This helps them to hone their skills, providing a life-changing opportunity and better academic exposure. In conclusion, the alternatives made are in the favour of Indian students, irrespective of the hurdles they have to dodge to get there."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story International education has gained exceptional popularity amongst Indian students in the past few years. While traditional destinations such as the US, the UK, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand remain popular, there is also an increasing inclination towards Ireland as a study-abroad destination. Known as the Emerald Isle, Ireland has one of the best education systems in the world. Students studying here are exposed to some of the best universities and their vibrant culture, post-study opportunities, and more. Irish educational institutes offer career opportunities worldwide, making them more attractive for international students. Beyond academics, Ireland also offers abundant opportunities for personal growth through cultural experiences, community engagement, and extracurricular pursuits. As a result, many international education aspirants, especially those from India, find it appealing to study in Ireland. According to the Higher Education Authority data, out of the 72,000 students who graduated in Ireland in 2021, slightly more than 10,000 were international students. Moreover, as per Ministry of External Affairs data, approximately 5,000 Indian students were studying in Ireland in 2022, and this number is projected to grow tenfold in 10 years. Here are the top five reasons why Ireland is one of the preferred destinations for studying shared by Piyush Kumar, Regional Director- South Asia and Mauritius, IDP Education. Ireland offers an excellent standard of education with seven top-level universities. Not only this, but there is also an increased focus on research and global collaboration. Moreover, the Irish Government closely checks the quality of education via the National Framework of Qualifications (NFF), ensuring that students get world-class learning opportunities, irrespective of the college. Irish education offers students good career opportunities across the world. Irish Universities offer a diverse range of programmes to suit every career aspiration. Ireland is home to over 1,000 multinational companies, including information and communication technology, pharmaceutical companies, financial services, medical devices, and gaming companies. Irish universities allow students to work part-time for 20 hours per week during the academic session. During summer and winter breaks, this increases to 40 hours per week. The financial independence allows students to not only support their education but also provides them with an option to stay back and seek employment under the Irish Third Level Graduate Scheme (for non-EU third-level graduates) to take the courses' completion. With a thriving ecosystem that supports startups and research initiatives, Ireland has gained the reputation of being the hub of innovation and entrepreneurship. Universities and colleges in Ireland form the top 1 percent of research institutes worldwide. They have dedicated centres and initiatives to help students turn their ideas into reality, making a meaningful contribution to society. Irish curriculums are always focused on innovative thinking, creativity, and problem-solving. Ireland has consistently ranked amongst the world's Top 20 countries for quality of life, peace, and human development. In 2023, it ranked 3rd on the Global Peace Index. The World Happiness Report 2024 has ranked Ireland as the 17th happiest country globally. With a low crime rate and a welcoming young population, students are likely to feel safe and supported throughout their time in the country, allowing them to focus on studying and enjoying their university experiences to the fullest. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} Ireland offers a well-rounded life for international students, with its unique blend of academic excellence, cultural enrichment, and personal growth opportunities. It ensures they enjoy a rewarding educational experience for a lifetime. With its welcoming atmosphere and strong sense of community, Ireland will stand out as one of the most preferred destinations for higher education."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The United Kingdom has become an irresistible draw for Indian students pursuing higher education. Latest figures testify to the UK's magnetic appeal, showing a striking 54% increase in sponsored study visas issued to Indian students. This isn't a fleeting boost; it signifies a paradigm shift in the preferences of young Indians with global aspirations. Compared to 2019, the number of study visas held by Indians has multiplied sevenfold, underscoring the UK's growing reputation as an academic hub. In concrete terms, the UK government issued nearly half a million sponsored study visas, of which an astounding 142,848 went to Indian students. Projections indicate that the number of Indian students flocking to the UK will surpass 300,000 in the upcoming academic year, solidifying the UK's position as the preferred destination of choice for Indian youth seeking not just education, but enriching experiences that go beyond the confines of classrooms. Let's delve into the factors that are attracting Indian students to classrooms in the UK, as highlighted by Nitish Jain, Founder & President of the SP Jain Group. In 2024, QS recognised London as the world's best city to study. This recognition takes into account London's preeminent position as a financial powerhouse with a flourishing job market, top-tier infrastructure, innovative smart city features, and vibrant student life. With an estimated 680,000 overseas students in London, the city offers unparalleled opportunities to create global networks and connections. Often referred to as the world's greatest city, London offers Indian students a life-changing experience that blends academic studies with cultural vibrancy and cosmopolitan allure. The UK is synonymous with prestige and excellence. Its rich cultural heritage, modern facilities, and high living standards offer an unmatched quality of life for students. With world-class healthcare, safety standards, and a vibrant cultural and social scene, the UK provides an ideal environment for personal and academic growth. Indian students can immerse themselves in a dynamic, multicultural society while enjoying a fulfilling student life experience. The UK prides itself on its rich academic heritage, with some of the world's top-ranking universities calling it home. From Oxford and Cambridge to dynamic, modern institutions, the UK offers several academic options across various fields. Indian students are enticed by the prospect of learning from renowned professors, gaining access to state-of-the-art facilities, and engaging in cutting-edge research. A degree from a UK university carries significant global prestige, unlocking a world of career opportunities. Global employers highly regard the rigorous academic standards and diverse skills of UK-educated graduates. For Indian students aiming to carve out successful international careers, studying in the UK provides a strategic edge. The UK is home to leading multinational corporations, financial institutions, and startups. Major Indian corporations such as Jaguar Land Rover, TCS, Infosys, Tata Steel, Taj Hotels, Hero Honda, among many others, maintain a strong presence in the UK, offering opportunities for professional growth and international collaboration. Indian students aspiring to careers in business, finance, or entrepreneurship find the UK to be the perfect launchpad to gain firsthand exposure to global markets and industry trends. Many universities partner closely with industry players, providing students with internships, placements, and networking opportunities that lay the groundwork for career progression and success. The Graduate Route Visa allows Indian graduates to live and work in the UK for two years (or three for PhD graduates) post their studies. This provides them with invaluable work experience that enhances their resume and could potentially open doors to permanent residency. The UK also offers students various part-time employment options spanning sectors like retail, hospitality, tutoring, and research assistance. Furthermore, many universities extend a helping hand with career guidance and job placement services, making the journey of finding the right job smoother for international students. One of the UK's greatest assets is its proximity to the rest of Europe. With excellent transportation infrastructure, students have easy access to explore diverse cultures, languages, and landscapes during their time abroad. This geographical advantage not only enriches the educational experience but also opens up career opportunities across Europe. Many industries in Europe value the education and skills gained from UK universities, providing Indian students with a gateway to pursue rewarding careers beyond the UK borders. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} As the global educational landscape continues to evolve, the UK is primed to retain its position as the preferred destination for Indian youth seeking higher education. Beyond the numbers, there's a compelling story of ambition, opportunity, and transformation. The influx of Indian students to the UK is more than a statistical anomaly; it's a testament to the enduring allure of British education and the boundless opportunities it offers to ambitious minds."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Education has long been viewed as a rigorous and often monotonous endeavour, yet the advent of gamification in learning and education is transforming this perception. By integrating game elements such as challenges, points, rewards, and badges into learning environments, educators are revolutionising the way students engage with and retain complex concepts. In India, the education market is rapidly expanding, gamification is playing a crucial role in making learning enjoyable and significantly enhancing educational outcomes. This innovative approach promises a future where education is synonymous with fun and effectiveness, catering to a diverse and growing population of learners. Akshay Munjal, Founder & CEO, Hero Vired has shared the rise of gamification in education. Gamification in education integrates game elements—like challenges, points, rewards, and badges—into learning environments. This fusion makes learning engaging and transforms tedious lectures into captivating experiences, significantly improving learning outcomes. A notable Gartner white paper reveals that gamified experiences can boost student engagement levels by up to 60 percent. While gamification introduces elements of play, it crafts an interactive and immersive learning experience, redefining traditional educational methods. The Learning Pyramid theory, introduced by Edgar Dale and later adapted by the National Training Laboratories Institute, explains retention rates for different teaching methods. Passive methods include lectures (5%), reading (10%), audio-visual (20%), and demos (30%). Active learning methods like group discussions (50%), practice by doing (75%), and teaching others (90%) are more effective. Many principles of gamification reflect the features of the Learning Pyramid, making learning more effective. Gamified learning uses additive grading, badges, and leaderboards to make education fun. Additive grading allows students to accumulate points by completing assignments. Badges are digital icons awarded for completing tasks or demonstrating certain skills, while leaderboards track rankings based on earned points. These elements boost student interest, enhance knowledge retention, and link learning to practical situations, offering instant feedback and reinforcement. One of gamification's biggest benefits is increased motivation through a competitive approach. Gamification ensures high motivation levels via rewards systems like points, levels, badges, and leaderboards. This appeals to learners' need for self-fulfillment. The report \"Online Education Market in India 2022-2026\" predicts that user engagement will rise due to gamification, helping the online education market in India reach $2.28 billion by 2026. Gamification in education is still in its early stages, with vast growth potential yet to be tapped. Its benefits include higher engagement, improved retention, and greater motivation through personalised learning pathways. A longitudinal study of 617 students over two years found that those in gamified workshops had better knowledge retention. Gamification provides personalised learning pathways, allowing learners to develop at their own pace, leading to better attention spans and improved memory. If fun-filled engagement can produce better learning outcomes, teachers, students, and parents will surely support this exciting approach. As the benefits of gamification in education continue to unfold, it becomes clear that this approach holds the key to higher engagement, improved retention, and greater motivation amongst learners. In India, the potential impact is particularly profound, with the whole Indian education market expected to reach USD 313 billion by 2030, driven by the increasing use of gamified learning. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} By embedding fun and interactivity into educational processes, gamification caters to the innate human desire for achievement and self-fulfillment. With substantial growth potential yet to be tapped, gamification stands poised to redefine traditional educational methods and create personalised learning pathways that empower students to excel. If the excitement and engagement brought by gamification can indeed yield superior learning outcomes, it is an approach that will undoubtedly garner the enthusiastic support of teachers, students, and parents across India."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The \"top leadership\" of the National Testing Agency is under the scanner over alleged irregularities in competitive exams NEET and NET, Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Saturday even as he denied any paper leak in the CSIR-UGC NET, which was postponed a day back. The minister said he is the custodian of students' interests and has to take that into account before taking any step. Amid a raging row over irregularities in the medical entrance exam NEET, Pradhan had said earlier this week that he cannot jeopardise the careers of the lakhs of candidates who cleared the exam rightfully. The June edition of the Joint Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and UGC-NET was postponed on Friday night. The Joint CSIR-UGC-NET is a test conducted to determine eligibility for junior research fellowship and assistant professor and admission to PhD in science courses. \"There was no leak in CSIR-UGC NET, it was postponed because of logistic issues. There is also a retest of 1,563 NEET candidates tomorrow. For smooth conduct of the exam everywhere, the decision was taken,\" Pradhan told reporters. Asked about any inquiry into the NTA's role, Pradhan said, \"I have already said there has been an institutional failure. I have taken responsibility. NTA's top leadership is under several types of questions. But I have to safeguard students' interests first. I am a custodian of their interests.\" Earlier this week, the ministry sought a report from the Bihar Police's Economic Offences Unit, which is investigating the allegations of paper leak in NEET. \"The report has not been received yet. But it is certain that nobody involved or responsible for any irregularity will be spared,\" he said. On irregularities in Gujarat's Godhra, the minister said the issue in Godhra was not of a paper leak but of organised cheating and 30 students have been debarred. \"Gujarat case is not of leak...police took preventive action, a few telephone conversations were intercepted. There were attempts to cheat, 30 students who have been found involved have been debarred. They are in addition to 63 students from across the country who were debarred from NEET for using unfair means,\" he said. The Centre is under fire over alleged irregularities in competitive exams NEET and NET. While the medical entrance exam question paper was allegedly leaked, a case being investigated by the Bihar Police, UGC-NET was cancelled a day after it was conducted following inputs that the integrity of the exam was compromised. The matter is being probed by the CBI. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} The education ministry on Saturday notified a seven-member panel headed by former ISRO chief K Radhakrishnan to ensure transparent, smooth and fair conduct of examinations through the NTA. On Friday night, the Centre operationalised a stringent law that aims to curb malpractice and irregularities in competitive examinations and entails provisions for a maximum jail term of 10 years and a fine of up to Rs 1 crore for offenders."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Language is a living entity, constantly evolving to adapt to new trends and cultural influences. Indian millennials, born between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s, and Gen Z, born in the late 1990s and early 2000s, have created their unique slang that reflects their identity, experiences, and cultural nuances. Here are seven popular slang words frequently used by Indian Gen-Z and even Millennials, diving into the meanings behind them and how they shape the way this generation communicates. One of the most commonly used words in Gen-Z conversations, 'sus,' short for suspicious, is used to describe someone or something that seems dubious or questionable. Whether it's someone acting strangely or a situation that feels off, millennials use 'sus' to express their feelings of uncertainty or unease. Gen-Z often uses 'GOAT' to refer to someone or something that they consider the greatest of all time. It is a term of high praise and admiration, reserved for individuals who have achieved extraordinary feats or have exceptional talent in a particular field. Derived from the word 'family,' 'fam' is used as a term of endearment for close friends or even extended social circles. It signifies the strong bond Gen-Z and Millennials share with their inner circle, often likening their friendships to that of family members. When something is 'lit,' it means it is exciting, amazing, or highly enjoyable. Gen-Z uses this term to express enthusiasm and appreciation for experiences, events, or even the latest trends that captivate their attention. A millennial motto, 'YOLO' stands for 'You Only Live Once.' It is a reminder to embrace life to the fullest, take risks, and seize every opportunity that comes their way. Millennials and Gen-Z often use 'YOLO' to justify adventurous decisions or spontaneous actions. Used in digital conversations, 'TBH' is an acronym for 'To Be Honest.' Gen-Z employs this phrase when they want to share a genuine opinion or reveal their true feelings about a particular topic, person, or situation. 'Stan' is derived from the combination of the words 'stalker' and 'fan.' Gen-Z uses this term to describe someone who is an avid and dedicated fan, often supporting their favorite celebrities, artists, or influencers wholeheartedly. --- As language continues to evolve, so does the lexicon of Indian millennials. These slang words have become a crucial part of their everyday conversations, reflecting their culture, experiences, and shared identity. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} As the Gen-Z and Millennial generations continue to shape society, their unique and vibrant language will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact on communication for years to come."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Paathakon! In a country as diverse as India, where languages weave a tapestry of unity, Hindi stands proudly as a pillar of communication, gracefully adapted across generations. However, over time, Hindi has undergone a linguistic evolution. For instance, terms like ' vartalap ' that were used decades ago in Shudh Hindi have effortlessly transformed into the more familiar and simpler 'baatcheet' or 'gappe' . As language gracefully embraces change, certain captivating Hindi words might have slyly slipped through the cracks of Gen Z's linguistic radar hidden behind the dominance of abbreviations and emojis. On the occasion of World Hindi Day, language learning app Duolingo delved into the delightful realm of Hindi to unearth ten quirky words that might have slipped through the cracks of Gen Z's digital dictionaries: While ' cringe' might be the word of choice today, the OG term for something that made you squirm was ' Wahiyaat .' Gen Z might not have heard the elders exclaim, \"Yeh kya wahiyaat cheez hai!\" Before emails and instant messaging , sending a letter through the postman was a heartfelt affair. Gen Z might be unaware of the excitement and anticipation that came with receiving a 'daak ticket' confirming the delivery of your precious message . This also reminds us of the famous song Dakiya Daak Laya (àäáàä¾àäàä¿àäïàä¾ àäáàä¾àä àä²àä¾àäïàä¾) by the legend Kishore Kumar and Vandana Shastri. Movie date? Gen Z might have never experienced the joy of waiting eagerly for the weekly dose of Bollywood movies on ' Chitrahaar .' It was a musical affair, and watching it with family was a tradition no one dared to miss. No, we're not talking about an online messaging app. Gen Z might not know that 'Telegram' was once a physical message-delivery service . People used to send important messages, greetings, and even condolences through this traditional means. In the pre-online shopping era, 'Khadim' was not just the name of a shoe brand but the local cobbler who repaired and polished your shoes. The personal touch and craftsmanship of these artisans are a distant memory for Gen Z. This refers to the all-encompassing presence that fills every corner . In a world of fleeting trends and vibe check, find your ‘Vyapti’ – the timeless essence that defines you. This is simply the magnetic pull that captivates and attracts. In Gen Z terms, it is the Insta-magnetism that makes everyone double-tap. This is the multiple-choice option life throws at you, where ‘all of the above’ is a valid answer. This refers to the Sherlock-level observation skills that turn you into the undisputed detective of your friend group. This is the artistic reflection that turns ordinary moments into Instagram-worthy masterpiece. So what do you think? We just took a wild ride through the desi language maze, unveiling some OG Hindi words that flew under Gen Z’s radar. From ‘Wahiyaat’ cringe to ‘Vichakshan’ detective skills, we resurrected linguistic legends. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} But here’s the plot twist – in the era of Duolingo, learning a language is a legit party! With lessons hotter than Gen Z’s favorite meme, it’s time to spice up your vocab and drop those Desi gems like a language boss."

In India, the linguistic landscape is a testament to the fusion of diverse cultures and languages. Hindi, as a widely spoken language, has significantly contributed to the Indian English lexicon. Here are 10 commonly used Hindi loan words that have seamlessly integrated into everyday English conversations in India: Derived from the Hindi word ‘b&amacr;z&amacr;r’, this term refers to the bustling markets of India. In English conversations, ‘bazaar’ retains its essence, referring to a market or commercial area, mirroring the vibrant trade culture of the Indian subcontinent. ‘Jungle’, borrowed from the Hindi word ‘jangal’, originates from the vast, dense forests of India.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In today's rapidly evolving work landscape, staying abreast of the latest workplace trends and jargon is crucial for professionals looking to stay relevant in water cooler discussions. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, this list of new-age workplace jargon should give you the inside scoop on what's hot and what's not in the world of work. From 'dry promotions' to 'swarm intelligence', we break down a few popular buzzwords and phrases shaping the modern workplace. So, get ready to level up your career game and stay ahead of the competition! One of the emerging trends in the corporate world is the concept of a 'dry promotion.' Unlike traditional promotions that come with a change in title or salary, a dry promotion refers to an increase in responsibilities without a corresponding change in job title or compensation. This trend is gaining traction as organisations seek to reward high-performing employees while maintaining budget constraints. 'Resenteeism' is a phenomenon where employees harbour feelings of resentment or dissatisfaction towards their work environment, leading to decreased engagement, productivity, and morale. Resenteeism can result from various factors, such as perceived unfair treatment, lack of recognition, or poor work-life balance. Addressing resenteeism requires organisations to foster a positive and inclusive workplace culture that values employee well-being and satisfaction. 'Resenteeism' is a phenomenon where employees harbour feelings of resentment or dissatisfaction towards their work environment. 'Coffee badging' is a practice in which employees strategically align themselves with influential or high-ranking colleagues by seeking opportunities to have informal coffee meetings or interactions. This networking tactic aims to build relationships, gain visibility, and establish connections with key decision-makers within an organisation. By engaging in coffee badging, employees can enhance their professional network, access mentorship, and potentially advance their careers through strategic relationship-building. In the era of hybrid work models, 'flexible fidelity' has emerged as a guiding principle for organisations seeking to balance flexibility and commitment. This term encapsulates the idea of honouring work agreements while remaining adaptable to changing circumstances. Embracing flexible fidelity allows employees to thrive in dynamic work environments while upholding professional integrity. 'Office peacocking' refers to the practice of employees flaunting their achievements, possessions, or status in the workplace to garner attention or impress colleagues. This behaviour often involves conspicuous displays of success, such as showcasing expensive items, name-dropping, or seeking recognition for accomplishments. While office peacocking can sometimes be harmless, it may also create a competitive or superficial work environment that detracts from genuine collaboration and teamwork. 'Swarm intelligence' refers to the collective behaviour of natural systems to solve complex problems or make decisions. 'Swarm intelligence' is a concept that draws inspiration from the collective behaviour of natural systems, such as swarms of insects, to solve complex problems or make decisions. This approach involves individuals working together collaboratively, leveraging their diverse perspectives and insights to achieve optimal outcomes. Swarm intelligence emphasises the power of collective wisdom and collaboration in driving innovation and problem-solving within organisations. With the rise of remote work and flexible arrangements, 'digital nomadism' has emerged as a popular career choice for many professionals. Digital nomads are individuals who leverage technology to work remotely from various locations, allowing them to blend work and travel seamlessly. This trend underscores the growing emphasis on work-life balance and location independence in today's workforce. --- .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} Staying informed about new workplace trends and jargons is key to thriving in today's dynamic work environment. By familiarising yourself with the above concepts, you would be able to navigate the complexities of modern workplaces with confidence and agility."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In a move to assure transparency, Maharashtra has once again led the way in conducting the admission process for professional courses in a computerized and centralised manner. This approach, now adopted by the Union government, ensures a system free from human intervention, stated Dilip Sardesai, commissioner of Maharashtra State Common Entrance Test (MHT-CET), on Saturday. Sardesai emphasised that students and parents should disregard any rumours, as all objections raised during the MHT-CET 2024 exams have been addressed and fully resolved. The entrance examinations for engineering, pharmacy, and agriculture courses were held from April 22 to 30 for the PCB group and from May 2 to 16 for the PCM group, across 169 centres. A total of 6,75,377 students, including 3,30,988 male, 3,94,033 female, and 31 transgender candidates, registered for the exams. Sardesai highlighted that the exams featured no negative marking, and results were declared using the percentile method without any grace marks. Result Calculation and Objections The results were processed by incorporating suggestions from subject experts into the revised answer sheets. Marks were declared based on a session-wise percentile formula, ensuring fairness. Candidates with equal raw scores within a single session were given the same percentile. Sardesai clarified that discrepancies in the marks as per the answer sheets were incorrect, as all objections were verified and resolved. The CET cell provided an online facility for candidates and parents to register objections regarding questions or answers. These objections were reviewed by subject experts, and necessary modifications were made to the answer sheets. The updated answer sheets were then published on the CET cell's website. MHT-CET 2024 Resolution Process Sardesai reiterated that the examination results were declared in session-wise percentiles, following a set formula. While exams are held in different batches, a single merit list is published. He addressed concerns about different question papers for each batch by explaining that results for each session were calculated independently but fairly. The procedure for result calculation was made available on the CET cell website in April 2024, well in advance of the exams. About 200 candidates and parents filed applications with the CET cell, all of which were verified and resolved. Furthermore, 54 candidates whose objections were accepted received refunds of their application fees online. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} Sardesai concluded by affirming that the results are declared batch-wise to ensure equal opportunities for all candidates in each session, a pattern implemented since 2018-19."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In the contemporary landscape of business and leadership, the metaphorical \"glass ceiling\" remains a significant barrier preventing women from reaching top-tier positions despite their qualifications and capabilities. This invisible barrier reflects deep-seated systemic issues, including unconscious biases, lack of mentorship, and organisational cultures that inadvertently favour male leadership. While progress has been made over the decades, with women increasingly entering the workforce and attaining higher education levels, their representation in senior leadership roles remains disproportionately low. In 2023, women held only 28% of senior management positions globally, and a mere 8% of Fortune 500 companies had female CEOs. These stark figures underscore the urgent need for targeted strategies to dismantle these barriers and create genuinely inclusive leadership opportunities. By implementing the measures, businesses can not only enhance gender equality but also unlock substantial economic and performance benefits. If we see current landscape, women have made significant strides in education and early career stages. However, their representation diminishes considerably in senior leadership roles. According to Catalyst, women hold only 28% of senior management roles globally as of 2023. Furthermore, only 8% of Fortune 500 companies have female CEOs, a figure that underscores the persistent gender disparity at the highest echelons of corporate leadership. The Business Case for Gender Diversity Gender diversity is not just a matter of fairness; it is also a critical economic and business imperative. A 2020 McKinsey report found that companies with greater gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability compared to those with less diversity. Additionally, gender-diverse companies are 21% more likely to experience above-average financial performance. These statistics highlight the tangible benefits of fostering an inclusive environment where women can thrive in leadership roles. Strategies for Breaking the Glass Ceiling 1. Mentorship and Sponsorship Programmes: Mentorship and sponsorship are vital for nurturing female talent. Mentors provide guidance, while sponsors actively advocate for women’s career advancement. A study by the Centre for Talent Innovation revealed that women with sponsors are 22% more likely to ask for stretch assignments and promotions compared to those without sponsors. Companies should establish formal mentorship and sponsorship programs to ensure women have access to the networks and opportunities needed for career advancement. 2. Leadership Development Programmes: Investing in leadership development programs tailored specifically for women can help bridge the gap. These programs should focus on building leadership skills, confidence, and providing women with the tools to navigate organisational politics. According to a report by the International Labour Organisation, women who participated in leadership training were 25% more likely to move into management roles. 3. Addressing Unconscious Bias: Unconscious bias training is essential for creating an inclusive workplace culture. Such training helps employees recognise and mitigate their biases, which can affect hiring, promotion, and day-to-day management decisions. Research by Harvard Business Review shows that companies with comprehensive unconscious bias training programs see a 30% increase in the number of women in leadership roles. 4. Setting and Tracking Diversity Goals: Organisations should set clear, measurable diversity goals and hold leadership accountable for meeting them. Transparency in tracking and reporting progress can drive accountability and ensure sustained focus on gender diversity initiatives. For instance, companies that publicly report their gender diversity statistics tend to perform better in promoting women to senior roles. 5. Creating an Inclusive Culture: An inclusive culture that values diverse perspectives and encourages open dialogue is fundamental. This includes having zero-tolerance policies for discrimination and harassment, promoting work environments where women feel safe and respected, and celebrating diversity through internal and external communications. In conclusion, breaking the glass ceiling is essential for promoting gender equality and leveraging the full potential of women in leadership roles. Effective strategies include providing mentorship and sponsorship, implementing leadership development programs, conducting unconscious bias training, and establishing clear diversity goals. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} These initiatives can significantly improve women's representation in senior positions, leading to enhanced organisational performance and innovation. By fostering an inclusive culture, businesses can ensure a more equitable and successful future, benefiting from the diverse perspectives and talents women bring to leadership."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has announced the postponement of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test Postgraduate (NEET PG), initially scheduled for June 23. This decision comes amid recent allegations concerning the integrity of several competitive examinations. The new exam date will be announced soon. In a statement, the ministry explained, \"Taking into consideration the recent incidents of allegations regarding the integrity of certain competitive examinations, the Ministry of Health has decided to undertake a thorough assessment of the robustness of the processes of the NEET-PG Entrance Examination, conducted by the National Board of Examination for medical students.\" Students have expressed their frustration and sorrow over the postponement. A candidate who travelled to Jaipur for the exam told ANI, \"The NEET-UG exam's paper got leaked, NEET-PG was postponed 12 hours before, and the NEET-SSC exam date has not been announced yet. This shows how much the government is concerned about the health sector. The Union Health Minister and Union Education Minister must apologise for what they have done. Students and doctors have travelled a long way for the exam and come here; they have incurred a lot of expenses. On average, Rs 10,000 was the expenditure. The government must reimburse these expenditures.\" Jyoth Chouhan, another candidate, highlighted the inconvenience caused by the last-minute notification, stating, \"NTA (National Testing Agency) informed us at the last moment, 10 hours before, that the exam had been postponed. If they had to reschedule, they should have announced that at least a few days ago. They didn't distribute exam centres properly; candidates got very faraway places at exam centres. Students from Vadodara had exam centres in Nashik and Madhya Pradesh. And then when they reached there, they were informed that the exam had been postponed. All are having great difficulties.\" Despite these setbacks, Dr. Rakesh Sharma, OSD to President and Member, Governing Body, NBEMS, assured the nation of their preparedness. Speaking exclusively to ANI, he said, \"All eyes of the nation are on NBEMS for the conduct of NEET PG 2024 and we will not let down the hope of the nation. We will conduct the test through a computer-based test (CBT) mode throughout the country.\" .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} The National Testing Agency (NTA), responsible for conducting the NEET-UG exams, is currently facing severe criticism over alleged irregularities, leading to protests and calls from political parties for its disbandment. In response, the Ministry of Education has formed a high-level committee of experts to recommend reforms in the examination process, improvements in data security protocols, and the overall functioning of the NTA."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story As the calendar turns to 2024, higher education institutions in India find themselves at a critical juncture, poised to address the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. The past year, 2023, has been a testament to the resilience and adaptability of these institutions, as they navigated through a myriad of changes that reshaped the landscape of admissions and student recruitment. Looking forward, academic leaders must adopt a proactive approach, driving innovation and redefining the future of higher education in the country. Reflecting on the trends that shaped Indian higher education in 2023 unveils a spectrum of challenges and questions that demand thoughtful consideration: 1) Declining Confidence in Higher Education: Despite a growth in student enrolment, there exists a lingering scepticism among the students regarding the value proposition of higher education. Rising college fees and evolving workforce demands have led to an increasing number of individuals exploring alternative pathways beyond traditional post-secondary education. This shift underscores the necessity for institutions to enhance academic programs, improve course offerings, and overhaul enrolment strategies to align with evolving student preferences and market demands. 2) Technology's Dual Role: The advent of technology has ushered in both opportunities and challenges for higher education institutes in India. While online learning platforms continue to offer flexibility and accessibility, the rise of generative AI tools has raised concerns regarding academic integrity. Institutions grapple with ensuring responsible use of AI technologies, navigating the fine line between leveraging digital tools for efficiency and safeguarding against potential misuse by students. 3) Policy and Regulatory Changes: Evolving policies from the regulators, as they fast track the implementation of the NEP 2020, necessitates changes in the admissions processes, recruitment strategies, and diversity initiatives in Indian higher education institutions. The evolving nature of these regulations underscores the need for institutions to adapt their admissions practices while upholding their commitment to outcome, diversity and inclusivity. As we step into 2024, it is evident that mere reactive responses to these challenges will not suffice. Institutions must embrace a proactive stance, driving innovation and implementing sustainable solutions to reshape the future of higher education in India. Three key priorities emerge for academic leaders in navigating the evolving landscape of higher education: 1) Revamping Admissions Processes: The need to revamp admissions processes to support diversity while complying with evolving legal frameworks is paramount. Institutions in India are increasingly turning towards holistic admissions practices that consider factors beyond traditional academic metrics, such as socioeconomic status and life experiences. This shift towards holistic evaluations not only broadens access to higher education but also fosters a more inclusive and equitable admissions process. 2) Re-evaluating Technology: The integration of technology in higher education necessitates a re-evaluation of its role and impact. Institutions must assess the value derived from digital tools while implementing safeguards to ensure responsible usage. Leveraging AI tools can streamline admissions processes and enhance efficiency, provided they are complemented by human oversight to uphold academic integrity. 3) Refocusing on Outcome: Amidst the whirlwind of changes, institutions need to remain steadfast in their core outcome of fostering transformative learning environments to improve employability. Advanced data analytics can aid institutions in aligning their programs with evolving student and industry demands while reaffirming the value proposition of an academic degree through targeted recruitment and marketing efforts. The year 2024 presents a transformative opportunity for higher education institutions in India to chart a new course for the future. By embracing innovation, driving sustainable change, and remaining committed to their core mission, academic leaders can navigate through the challenges and uncertainties, paving the way for a reinvigorated higher education landscape in the country. As we embark on this journey of renewal, let us reimagine the role and purpose of higher education in India, ensuring it continues to empower individuals and contribute meaningfully to society's progress and prosperity.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Studying abroad offers students a transformative experience - combining academic excellence with cultural immersion and personal growth. Indian students are increasingly seeking international educational opportunities. The Ministry of External Affairs reports that in 2023, a record 15 lakh Indian students were studying abroad. Selecting a study destination requires careful consideration of various factors, including university reputation, program offerings, financial feasibility, and future career prospects. The decision-making process can be overwhelming due to the multitude of options available across different countries and institutions. As applications for the 2025 academic year approach, study-abroad consultants have identified several popular destinations for Indian students. These countries are known for their world-class education systems, rich cultural experiences, and vibrant student communities. Here's all you need to know from the expert Saif Iqbal, Vice President, ApplyBoard. Adding to the allure, Ireland's \"Stay Back Option\" allows graduates to remain in the country for up to two years after graduation to seek employment. This valuable opportunity facilitates gaining practical experience and exploring career prospects in a thriving job market in sectors like technology, finance, pharmaceuticals, and engineering. Additionally, Ireland's immigration policies favour international graduates, making the transition to a work visa smoother. The \"Graduate Scheme\" and the \"Critical Skills Employment Permit\" support skilled graduates by facilitating their employment and long-term settlement. Germany's booming job market has a strong demand for skilled professionals. After graduation, students can extend their residence permit for up to 18 months to seek employment. This allows them to gain valuable practical experience and explore career opportunities in Germany or across Europe. The \"Job Seeker Visa\" allows graduates to search for a job relevant to their field of study for up to six months after graduation, facilitating a smooth transition to a work visa. It is no wonder that Germany boasts the highest \"stay rate\" of international students in the world (behind Canada), with nearly 40% choosing to stay and build a life in the country. As we look forward to the 2025 academic year, Germany, Ireland, and the USA are leading the way in providing students with exceptional educational experiences and promising futures. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} These countries offer a blend of academic excellence, affordable education, and strong post-graduation career opportunities.

The National Testing Agency (NTA), responsible for conducting the NEET-UG exams, is currently facing severe criticism over alleged irregularities, leading to protests and calls from political parties for its disbandment. The entrance examinations for engineering, pharmacy, and agriculture courses were held from April 22 to 30 for the PCB group and from May 2 to 16 for the PCM group, across 169 centres. Amid a raging row over irregularities in the medical entrance exam NEET, Pradhan had said earlier this week that he cannot jeopardise the careers of the lakhs of candidates who cleared the exam rightfully. Amid the ongoing NEET controversy, the Bihar State Examination Board has postponed the Competency Test for Teachers (CTT) 2024. The exam, initially scheduled for June, is now likely to be held in July. The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has intensified its protests against the National Testing Agency (NTA), with demonstrations spreading across multiple states. The ABVP demands a CBI inquiry into alleged paper leaks in the NEET-UG examination, calling for strict measures to prevent future occurrences. The National Medical Commission (NMC) has cut the mandatory internship duration to one year, following student protests against the earlier 2 to 3-year requirement. Check the complete notice here. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has launched Online Capacity Building Programmes for educators, aligning with NEP 2020. These programs aim to enhance career counselling and psychosocial support skills. School and Mass Education Minister Nityananda Gond had earlier said decisions regarding school reopening and timings would be reassessed based on prevailing weather conditions. Sources further indicated that at present there has been no thought to cancel the NEET UG paper. Minister Dharmendra Pradhan also made it clear in a press conference that for a few concentrated incidents of malpractice, the future of all students cannot be put in jeopardy. The cancellation of the UGC NET exam due to irregularities has sparked widespread anger among students, who are now questioning the integrity of the NEET exam and demanding systemic reforms. West Bengal Education Minister Bratya Basu has announced a centralised admission process for undergraduate courses in state-run colleges, starting June 24, to streamline admissions and ensure fair seat allocation. Amid allegations of paper leaks and irregularities in NEET-UG 2024, many aspirants are calling for a retest for all candidates, citing a lack of faith in the National Testing Agency (NTA). Amid the NEET UG and NET controversies, the NSUI held a protest outside Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan’s residence.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A Mumbai-based doctor has been swindled out of Rs 7 lakh by fraudsters who used a deepfake video of industrialist Mukesh Ambani to endorse a bogus share trading academy. The victim, Dr KH Patil, a 54-year-old Ayurveda practitioner residing in Andheri, fell prey to the scam after seeing the video on Instagram in April. Dr Patil initially came across the deepfake video on April 15 while scrolling through her Instagram feed. The video depicted Ambani promoting the success of a trading academy named Rajiv Sharma Trade Group and urging people to join BCF Academy for high returns on investments, the woman mentioned in her complaint to the police. Believing the endorsement to be genuine, Dr Patil searched for the group online and found that they purportedly had offices in London and at the Bandra Kurla Complex in Mumbai, which further convinced her of their legitimacy. According to the FIR, Dr. Patil contacted the academy online and proceeded to invest a total of Rs 7.1 lakh between May and June. She was provided with an account where she could monitor her investments, which quickly showed a profit of over Rs 30 lakh. However, when she attempted to withdraw the profits earlier this month, her attempts repeatedly failed. Realizing she had been duped, Dr. Patil consulted friends who advised her to approach the police. The Oshiwara Police in Andheri have registered a case against unidentified persons and are currently investigating 16 bank accounts to which Dr Patil transferred money. Police officials are in contact with the banks for further details. There have been previous incidents involving deepfake videos of Ambani used to promote other fraudulent trading education programs. The police have also noted a trend of cyber scamsters exploiting social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram to lure unsuspecting investors. A similar scam surfaced after the pre-wedding function of Anant Ambani, where scammers used images from the event to direct people to fraudulent investment platforms. Authorities have issued a warning to the public to always verify the authenticity of investment opportunities in person and not rely solely on online information. They stressed that cyber fraudsters have increasingly been using deepfake videos of well-known personalities to deceive people."

According to the new plan, vehicles are prohibited from entering or exiting Basant Road and Nehru Bazar in the direction of the New Delhi Railway Station. This aims to reduce bottlenecks and improve traffic flow around the busy railway hub. Vehicles from Basant Road and Nehru Bazar intending to reach the station must now use an alternative route via Basant Road leading to Chelmsford Road. This redirection is expected to decongest the primary access routes and make traffic more manageable, according to officials. A prohibition has also been announced on right turns from the New Delhi Railway Station towards Basant Road and Nehru Bazar for vehicles coming from the Nabi Karim side through the underpass. This measure is intended to alleviate traffic pressure at the critical junctions, ensuring a smoother commute for everyone involved. \"The effectiveness of these measures will be closely monitored by the Delhi Traffic Police. If deemed effective in mitigating the traffic menace, the measures will be implemented on a permanent basis,\" officials added."

Atishi's indefinite hunger strike to demand water for Delhi, which is under the grip of a severe water crisis and scorching heat, entered the third day here. In a video message on X, she said, \"I have been on a hunger strike to get Delhi's share of water.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Enforcement Directorate has raided various locations in Mumbai in connection with the ongoing investigation into the investment fraud case against businessman Amber Dalal, who is accused of cheating 1,300 investors out of over Rs 600 crore. The raids, conducted under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), took place on June 21 and resulted in the seizure of movable assets, including cash, frozen bank funds, and Demat account holdings totalling Rs 37 crore. Various documents and digital devices were also found during the searches, officials said. The Enforcement Directorate initiated the investigation based on an FIR filed by the Mumbai Police. It revealed that Dalal, proprietor of Ritz Consultancy Service, allegedly took money from investors through a suspected Ponzi scheme by promising high returns. He then absconded with their money after giving them initial returns. According to officials, Dalal raised more than Rs 600 crore from 1,300 investors. Dalal, a Chartered Accountant by profession, was arrested by the Economic Offences Wing of the Mumbai Police and is presently under judicial custody. As per the probe details, Dalal raised money from investors on the pretext that he invested the funds in nine commodities --gold, silver, crude oil, natural gas, zinc, lead, nickel, copper, and aluminium -- and traded in them. He made the investors believe that the invested money was safe and promised an annual return of 18 to 22 per cent. Using the same modus operandi, he raised money from investors in the UAE and the USA as well, the Enforcement Directorate sources said. Amber Dalal then diverted the funds received in his company’s account to personal accounts, which were further routed to family members' accounts and used for creating assets. He has diverted approximately Rs 51 crore to his personal accounts, which was used to acquire assets in India and abroad. Eight such immovable properties in India and two such properties abroad have been identified by the probe agency. It was also found that the payments received from new investors were used to pay out the monthly returns to the old investors. Dalal received money in cash as well, which was then accounted for in connivance with Mumbai-based jewelers. Returns on such cash-based investments were given to investors in India and abroad by hawala operators. The search operations unveiled details of a network of stockbrokers and investment advisors who brought clients in exchange for commissions. Further investigation into the case is in progress, officials said."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A lawyer appearing for WhatsApp told the Delhi High Court that the Meta-owned messaging platform \"goes if we are told to break encryption\". The advocate also told the court that people use the platform due to the privacy it assures and also because messages are end-to-end encrypted. The remarks were made as the High Court was on Thursday hearing petitions by WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook Inc, now Meta, challenging the 2021 Information Technology (IT) rules for social media intermediaries requiring the messaging app to trace chats and make provisions to identify the first originator of information. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 were announced by the Centre on February 25, 2021. It requires large social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to comply with the latest norms. Appearing for the messaging platform, lawyer Tejas Karia told a bench of Acting Chief Justice Manmohan and Justice Manmeet Pritam Singh Arora, “As a platform, we are saying, if we are told to break encryption, then WhatsApp goes,” Bar and Bench reported. “We will have to keep a complete chain, and we don’t know which messages will be asked to be decrypted. It means millions and millions of messages will have to be stored for a number of years,” he said. The bench, while observing that the matter would have to be argued by the parties, asked if a similar law exists in any other country. \"There is no such rule anywhere else in the world. Not even in Brazil,\" the lawyer replied. The court further said that privacy rights were not absolute and \"somewhere balance has to be done\". Meanwhile, the lawyer appearing for the Centre said the rule was significant when objectionable content is spread on platforms in cases such as those of communal violence. The bench ordered that the matter be listed for hearing on August 14 to await the transfer of all other petitions challenging several aspects of the 2021 IT Rules to it pursuant to a Supreme Court order. On March 22, the Supreme Court transferred to the Delhi High Court a batch of pleas pending before different high courts across the country challenging the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. Several petitions were pending on the issue before different high courts, including Karnataka, Madras, Calcutta, Kerala and Bombay."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Indian-origin student Achinthya Sivalingam has been arrested and banned from Princeton University in the US, pending a disciplinary process, for participating in an unauthorised student-led pro-Palestine encampment protest within the campus premises. The development comes amid continued protests at major universities across the US against the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Sivalingam, who was born in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, and raised in Columbus, Ohio, was arrested on Thursday along with another fellow student, Hassan Sayed, the Princeton Alumni Weekly reported, citing a document by the protest organisers that identified the two. On Thursday morning, student protesters had set up tents in the University's McCosh Courtyard despite warnings from authorities, the Princeton Alumni Weekly reported. Within minutes, the two students were arrested, which led to the protesters packing up their tents while continuing to stage a sit-in demonstration. The sit-in protest, which initially saw a crowd of about 110 people, increased to some 300 by Thursday afternoon. Confirming Thursday's development, Princeton University spokesperson Jennifer Morrill said the two graduate students were arrested \"after repeated warnings from the Department of Public Safety to cease activity and leave the area”. They “have been immediately barred from campus, pending a disciplinary process”, she said, adding that the remaining tents in the encampment area were “voluntarily taken down by protesters\". “No force was used by Public Safety officers when conducting the arrests, which occurred without resistance,” the Princeton Alumni Weekly quoted the spokesperson as saying. At the protest site, Max Weiss, an associate professor of history at Princeton University, announced, “Long live the solidarity, brilliance, and fearlessness of these brave Princeton students who put their bodies, privilege, and safety on the line when Palestinians are being subjected to unimaginable violence.\" Thursday's protest was part of a series of demonstrations planned at Princeton University organised by campus groups, including the Princeton Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), the Princeton Palestine Liberation Coalition, and Princeton Israeli Apartheid Divest (PIAD). In an email sent to students this week regarding the pro-Palestine protests on campus, Rochelle Calhoun, Vice President for Campus Life at Princeton University, said demonstrations that involve “occupying or blocking access to buildings [or] establishing outdoor encampments and sleeping in any campus outdoor space” were prohibited. “Any individual involved in an encampment, occupation, or other unlawful disruptive conduct who refuses to stop after a warning will be arrested and immediately barred from campus. For students, such exclusion from campus would jeopardise their ability to complete the semester,\" she said in her email. \"In addition, members of our community would face a disciplinary process (for students this could lead to suspension, delay of a diploma, or expulsion).” Protests have intensified at major universities across the US, including Ivy League schools Harvard and Yale, after more than 100 people were arrested at New York's Columbia University last week. According to a tally by the Reuters news agency, nearly 550 arrests have been made in the past one week. On Thursday alone, at least 61 protesters were arrested -- 28 at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia and 33 at Indiana University. Meanwhile, protesting students at Columbia University, the epicentre of the pro-Palestinian protests, have refused to stop their stir until the prestigious institution agrees to cut ties with Israeli academic institutions and disinvest its funds from entities linked to the Jewish nation."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Voting for the second phase of the Lok Sabha elections for 88 seats across 13 states was held on Friday. All eyes were on Kerala, where polling took place in all 20 constituencies. Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged citizens, especially the young and women voters, to vote in \"record numbers\". Follow live updates of phase 2 of Lok Sabha elections 2024 here Meanwhile, the Election Commission received over 290 complaints in Bengal, mostly related to EVM malfunctioning. In a letter to the poll body, the ruling Trinamool Congress sought its immediate intervention. However, Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar slammed the party, saying courts have repeatedly said there is nothing wrong with the EVMs and yet people keep questioning them. Polling was held for 88 seats across 13 states in the second phase of Lok Sabha polls, including all 20 constituencies in Kerala and 14 of 28 seats in Karnataka. Besides, polling was held in Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Bengal, Manipur, Tripura, and Jammu and Kashmir. Several prominent people cast their votes in the second phase, including Congress's Shashi Tharoor, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, author and philanthropist Sudha Murty and her husband and Infosys founder Narayana Murthy, actor Prakash Raj, Team India coach Rahul Dravid, and his former teammate Anil Kumble, among others. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the second phase of voting was \"too good\". \"Gratitude to the people across India who have voted today. The unparalleled support for NDA is going to disappoint the Opposition even more,\" he wrote on X. The overall voter turnout was recorded as 60.96 per cent at 7 pm after polling concluded. The polling for the second phase of the Lok Sabha elections began at 7 am on Friday. In Kerala, polling in many constituencies completed around 10:45 pm due to the heatwave conditions. In some booths of Vatakara constituencies, polling is still going on and will be completed soon. Most voters had turned up in huge numbers towards the closing hours of voting. They had to wait for hours due to technical issues. They alleged a lack of experience of the polling staff at certain booths as the reason behind the delay in casting their votes. Chaos erupted in Bengal's Balurghat after 'go back' slogans were raised at state BJP chief Sukanta Majumdar, and police forces rushed to control the situation. Majumdar, who is the BJP candidate for the seat, blamed ruling Trinamool Congress's \"hooligans\" for the incident. Earlier in the day, a war of words broke out between the BJP and the Trinamool over attempts to influence voters in Balurghart and Raiganj. Trinamool claimed central forces were undermining the democratic process and stopping women voters, while Sukanta Majumdar hit back, alleging the ruling party was distributing money among voters. Chaos was reported in Mangalore as well after a BJP worker objected to Congress Dakshin Kannada pick Padmaraj speaking to the media within 100 metres of a polling station after casting his vote. The police rushed to the scene and took the BJP worker. Kerala witnessed the battle of heavyweights with Rahul Gandhi striving to retain his Wayanad seat, and Congress veteran Shashi Tharoor hoping to win for the fourth time from Thiruvananthapuram against Union Minister and BJP leader Rajeev Chandrasekhar. After casting his vote, Tharoor said he was \"confident\" about victory and called the elections \"far greater than my own future\". Among the eight constituencies where voting was held in Uttar Pradesh, the focus was on Mathura and Meerut. BJP pick Hema Malini is seeking a hat-trick from Mathura, while the party's Meerut candidate Arun Govil, famous for playing Lord Ram's character on the Ramayan TV show, made his electoral debut. Furthermore, voting was held in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad. All schools, colleges, factories and industries were shut for the day in these regions due to the polls. BJP's Ghaziabad candidate Atul Garg cast his vote and urged all voters to exercise their democratic right to bring about a responsible and good government. There were a total of 1,210 candidates in the fray in this phase. The BSP fielded the most candidates in this phase at 74, followed by the BJP at 69 and the Congress at 68. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the NDA had won 65 of these seats. While the BJP had won 53 seats, its allies bagged 12. On the other hand, the INDIA bloc had won 23 of the 89 seats in the last general election."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Supreme Court on Friday rejected all the petitions seeking the complete verification of votes cast using Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) with Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips. A two-judge bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta also rejected a demand to go back to ballot papers in elections. \"We rejected all pleas related to bringing ballot papers again.\" Justice Khanna said at the hearing. The writ petitions were filed by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), Abhay Bhakchand Chhajed and Arun Kumar Aggarwal. During the hearing, the bench said that it gave the Election Commission of India (ECI) two directions. \"One direction is after the completion of the symbol loading process, the Symbol Loading Unit (SLU) should be sealed. The SLU should be stored at least for a period of 45 days,\" it said. \"The burnt memory in the microcontroller EVM shall be checked by a team of engineers after the declaration of results on a request by candidates in serial numbers 2 and 3. Such a request has to be made within seven days after the declaration of results.\" Justice Khanna further asked the poll body to examine the suggestion for an electronic machine for vote counting the paper slips and whether along with the symbol there can be a bar code for each party. Justice Khanna said the \"expenses for the verification (of the program) to be borne by the candidates making the request, in case the EVM is found to be tampered, the expenses will be refunded\". \"Blindly distrusting a system can lead to unwarranted suspicions,\" Justice Datta said, adding, \"democracy is all about maintaining harmony and trust among all the pillars\". \"By nurturing a culture of trust and collaboration we can strengthen the voice of our democracy,\" he added. On April 18, the court had reserved its judgement on the petitions after a two-day hearing, and on Wednesday, it asked the ECI to provide clarification on five of its queries regarding the functioning of EVMs. During the hearing on Wednesday, the bench asked the poll body to clarify if the microcontroller is installed in the controlling unit or in the VVPAT; is the microcontroller one-time programmable; the number of available Symbol Loading Units; data period storage; and whether the Control Unit is only sealed or is the VVPAT is kept separately. After a poll body official responded to the court's queries, the bench said, \"We cannot control the elections, we cannot control the functioning of another constitutional authority.\" \"The ECI has cleared doubts. We cannot change your thought process. We cannot issue a mandamus on the basis of suspicion,\" it added. Presently, VVPAT verification is done only in five randomly selected EVMs in each Assembly segment of a parliamentary constituency. At all the EVM-VVPAT verification hearings, the ECI had maintained that the EVMs cannot be tampered with under any circumstances and that the complete counting of the VVPAT slips is not practically feasible. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court had issued a notice to the ECI on a petition seeking the counting of all VVPAT paper slips in elections, instead of verifying only the five randomly selected EVMs. The petition challenged the Election Commission's guidelines that mandate that VVPAT verification shall be done sequentially, that is one after the other, thereby causing undue delay. It contended that if simultaneous verification was done and an additional number of officers were deployed for counting in each Assembly constituency, then complete VVPAT verification could be done in just five to six hours."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story 'Chandu Champion' almost touched the benchmark of Rs 70 crore after its second weekend at the box office. The Kartik Aaryan-starrer is purely working on positive word-of-mouth . The collection during the second weekend saw a drop as compared to the opening weekend, but led to a decent total. The film earned Rs 17.63 crore nett in the second weekend, taking the overall collection of 10 days to Rs 57.76 crore. 'Chandu Champion' is facing tough competition from 'Munjya'. The Sharvari Wagh and Mona Singh-starrer is also enjoying good word-of-mouth and that's the reason it has managed to divide the audience's choice. The supernatural film has collected Rs 83.2 crore in 17 days and is expected to cross the benchmark of Rs 100 crore in its lifetime run. 'Chandu Champion' has got another week of free run before 'Kalki 2898 AD' hits the screen this Friday and takes over. The advance booking for the Prabhas-starrer has begun and is off to a terrific start in India. Directed by Nag Ashwin, the film is a sci-fi fantasy and has already sold over 2 lakh tickets by the end of Sunday on Book My Show alone, reported the trade website sacnilk . With five more days to perform at the ticket window, 'Chandu Champion' is expected to wrap up its lifetime run at around Rs 68–70 crore. A lot also depends on the performance of 'Kalki 2898 AD'. While the first weekend will remain packed in theatres, only good word-of-mouth from the audience will take its run ahead from Monday onwards. And if the film fails to impress the audience, things will start working in favour of 'Chandu Champion' again."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story When the Netflix film 'Maharaj' hit the screens, all we knew was that it featured Jaideep Ahlawat, a man with superb acting skills, and Aamir Khan's son, Junaid Khan, who was making his screen debut with this one. He was just another nepo-kid, trying his hand at making it big on OTT first before entering Bollywood - a league that most star-kids have started to choose lately. Little did we know that Junaid would come out as a whiff of fresh air, a perfect non-hero-like hero, rising above all the conventional qualities that a quintessential Bollywood actor boasts. Very little was known about him anyway. So, when he took over the screen, playing a determined journalist from the pre-independence era, you sat up and noticed. Junaid comes from the legacy of talented artists. His grandfathers, Nasir Hussain and Tahir Hussain, were renowned filmmakers and screenwriters. His father, Aamir Khan, is one of the most celebrated actors in the country , often regarded as Mr. Perfectionist by his fans and the media. Come to think of it, it was a thoughtful decision on the family's part to avoid the big debut promotion for Junaid, in order to save him from all the pressure to do exceptionally well in the name of his father. It might have given him a breathing space, to focus only on his performance - something which brilliantly showed on the screen. 'Maharaj', directed by Siddharth P Malhotra who previously helmed Rani Mukerji-starrer 'Hichki', has its problems. The loose screenplay and the predictable storyline don't let you enjoy it the most. But, Junaid makes it worth your watch. In every scene he features, he delivers the dialogues with the utmost conviction. The clarity in his language and command of Sanskrit and Hindi is such that no new generation star, let alone a star-kid, comes close to him. Junaid becomes a lover boy, a thinking individual, a fearless warrior and an aware citizen in one character - a quality that other newcomers take ages to find and polish in their acting journey. In a scene where he yearns to smear gulaal on the face of the only woman he loves, he reminds you of his father, Aamir, in the 1996 film 'Raja Hindustani' in which a timid Raja remains cooped up in the beckoning beauty of his madam, Aarti, longing to finally being with her. Junaid doesn't let you make any exception for him, for being new, or for being a star's son. In fact, everytime he shares the screen-space with Ahlawat, one of the finest performers of our time, he makes you gaze at him even more. In 'Maharaj', he faces camera for the first time in a full-fledged role, in the presence of a blazing co-star, and never flinches. Junaid's performance in the film looks steady, almost as if he's learnt the art of controlling his emotions and giving away just the exact amount required on the camera. In a scene when he finds out about his fiancée dying by suicide, a basic Bollywood hero would give in to the heightened melodrama. But, Junaid gives a poised performance. His heartbreak is internal, and at every moment, his emotions are contained. His outrage at the man causing the death is real and as filmy as the next scene looks with Karsan (his character) issuing a warning to Maharaj, Junaid manages to hold his composure with the most concise form of acting. His diction is perfect and his demeanour, of an actor who's learnt the most meticulous details of his craft. 'Maharaj' might have been an ordinary story about a man who helped contribute to the changing fabric of the nation on the verge of independence. But, it turns out to be much more than that. It is a celebratory debut of Junaid Khan, the 31-year-old who's here to shine without those six-pack abs, the PR, the brand endorsements or any visible validation from his family. The journey is long, but the man has already received what any newbie in the industry should aim for - the audience's trust, which will take him a long way!"

They thought I was in Mumbai to intern. I had told them I was doing a biotech internship at Kokilaben.\" \"Pyaar Ka Punchnama was not very big at that time, it was a small-budget film with newcomers, and I faced this when I signed a film and it didn’t happen. Also, I didn’t want people to taunt me with ‘Hero ban gaya tu’ (You have become a hero). So when Punchnama happened and the trailer was released, I showed it to my housemates for the first time. They were all happy to see one of us be there at least,” Kartik added. Kartik also spoke about how despite being an outsider, he got a chance to flourish in the industry, but he was initially quite scared to take that leap of faith: “I came from Gwalior and had never stayed alone. I was moving to Mumbai forever, so I was scared. Also, I was entering the industry for the first time. My mother thought I was going to Mumbai to study and live in a hostel. I was worried about not getting work and had heard unpleasant stories about Bollywood at that time.\" Kartik was last seen in Kabir Khan's Chandu Champion , for which his performance has been garnering praise from all quarters."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Telugu actor Dr Rajshekar's 2019-film 'Kalki' is back in the news for a hilarious reason. Recently, multiple shows of 'Kalki' went housefull after Prabhas' fans mistook it for his film, 'Kalki 2898 AD'. BookMyShow, the ticketing platform, opened shows for Rajasekhar's film instead of Prabhas-starrer. It is to be noted that Prabhas and Nag Ashwin's 'Kalki 2898 AD' will release in theatres on June 27. Actor Rajasekhar reacted to the goof-up in a funny way on the X app. He said that he doesn't have anything to do with the mix-up. Reportedly, nearly 20 shows of Rajashekar's 'Kalki' were sold out. Rajasekhar wrote, \"Naaku assalu sammandham ledhu (I have no connection). Jokes apart...

    "article_content": "Listen to Story 'Ishq Vishq Rebound' opened on a dull note at the box office. Even with a huge promotional schedule, the film failed to impress the audience and collected only Rs 3.55 crore in three days. The first film in the 'Ishq Vishq' franchise was the big Bollywood debut for Shahid Kapoor. The second film provided a platform for Pashmina Roshan, Hrithik Roshan's cousin, for her Bollywood entry. Directed by Nipun Dharmadhikari, the film collected Rs 3.55 crore in three days. The Sunday-collection for the film remained in the range of Rs 1-1.50 crore, showing a dismal run at the box office. 'Ishq Vishq Rebound' opened at a mere Rs 1 crore and the rest of the weekend didn't see any growth worth mentioning. 'Ishq Vishq Rebound' faced direct competition from 'Chandu Champion' and 'Munjya' at the ticket window. Both the films are riding high on positive word-of-mouth, which further posed more difficulty for the Rohit Saraf-starrer to perform decently. It has now got a five-day window to add more business to its overall collection, after which 'Kalki 2898 AD' will be released, taking over the screens all over the country. The young romantic-comedy didn't manage to entertain the audience even on its targeted screens - the Tier I markets. The collection from the heartland areas is nothing worth writing home about. 'Ishq Vishq Rebound' has now entered its first week and, unfortunately, there seems no hope for the film to even reach Rs 10 crore by the end of its run at the box office. Even if the Prabhas-starrer doesn't receive good reviews, 'Ishq Vishq Rebound' isn't expected to gain much, with the audience already preferring 'Chandu Champion' and 'Munjya' over it."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 13 Jun, 2024 With the influx of superhero franchises, supes aka superhumans feel more ordinary than extraordinary today. Unless it’s ‘The Boys.' The show returns with yet another formidable season. The fourth season of ‘The Boys’ starts from where it left things in the last season. However, this time, the approach is slower and almost melancholic, instead of its usual high-energy-infused sequences. Showrunner Eric Kripke focuses on diving deeper into the character arcs and backstories of his protagonists, which offer a deep insight into the psyches of each character without compromising on the show’s theme. If anything, the season spells out in more ways than one, that Homelander (Antony Starr) is the anti-hero of the millennium. Billy Butcher [Karl Urban] is diagnosed with a terminal illness which makes him more restrained than previous seasons. His rivalry with Homelander refuses to take a backseat, as the latter continues to make his way towards the top of the Vought Tower. But he is often seen spacing off, overwhelmed by fatherhood duties and the greed to leave behind a legacy. Marvin Milk [Laz Alonso], on the other hand, takes charge as the commander of ‘The Boys’ whilst tackling anxiety. Parallel to these storylines, you have Frenchie [Tomer Capone], whose dark past continues to haunt his pursuit of happiness, while Hughie [Jack Quaid] is constantly being tested. With all this happening, the political subtext or commentary in ‘The Boys’ continues to be unhinged. Frenchie’s story, however, seems to be presented in a never-ending loop, which has now started to feel slightly overbearing. Corruption is at its all-time high, and the representation seems oddly familiar; a reflection of the world we are living in. Homelander is the authoritarian bully who will become a threat to world peace if he holds any legal power. Vought International is where the financial power to propagate corruption stems from. It is through this that we see a bird's eye view of what the situation has come to look like in present-day America. Yes, that reality can be best attested to America since the show is set there, but the global scenario is no different. This is what makes ‘The Boys’ more relatable than ever. ‘The Boys’ Season 4 is now streaming on Prime Video."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 20 Jun, 2024 I don't know if it was because I watched the show at three in the morning, but the last episode did manage to leave me in tears. I have never been to Kota, never dreamt of IIT, but there's something about Kota Factory that resonates with everyone. Be it the constant pressure amongst the youth to prove themselves, their friendships, or their equation with their favorite teacher, 'Jeetu Bhaiya' in this case. There's a scene towards the end when Meena says, \" Jeetu bhaiya jeevan ka path dete hai (he gives life lessons)\", and you do agree with him. The third season beautifully captures this special mentor-mentee bond and also sheds light on grappling with mental health, an issue that needs to be discussed more often. First things first, the song 'Jo Bhi Hoga Ladd Lunga' captivates the entire show in itself. Students who move to Kota to prep for IIT or even NEET require grit and a tough heart. The exams are not easy, there are failures along the way, but one has to keep going. 'Kota Factory 3', through its narration, tries to celebrate this preparation rather than the victorious outcome. \" Jeet ki tayari nahi, tayari hi jeet hai \"- says Jeetu Bhaiya. This season, the emphasis is once again on aiming rather than dreaming, a thought that has found a home in most competitive exam students. This season, Jitendra Kumar is also battling with the responsibility of being the 'bhaiya' versus being the 'sir'. The last season had ended on a tragic note with a student taking her own life, and Jeetu Bhaiya is seen being consumed by grief. As he meets a therapist, we also get to understand how important yet easy it is to sometimes seek help. Given the high rates of suicide in Kota over the last few months, this show could be an eye-opener for parents, teachers, and every stakeholder who shapes a student's life. Watch the trailer here: Full points to the makers for highlighting that even though struggle is subjective, it affects everyone in its own way. While mediocre students burn the midnight oil to match up with their friends, the smart ones need to maintain their grades. Some students also need to pick between studies and supporting their family, weighing them down further. And then there are also matters of the heart as they encounter the bloom of first love. Even though the climax seemed a bit forced to invoke drama, I think most of the audience had already anticipated it. Another weak element for me was when one of the student's parents was introduced. While the characters may be important, the melodrama seemed a little unfit for a show like this. The same goes for Vaibhav's monologue about the exam dates. Too loud, too forced, yet very ineffective. Coming to performances, after 'Panchayat 3', Jitendra Kumar once again proves why he is one of the most viable actors on OTT. It may be his engineering background, but he is inimitable as Jeetu Bhaiya, almost as if it's his alter ego. The actor has come a long way, and it's a personal desire to see him break out from these realistic roles and do something whimsical on screen. The latest entrant, Tilottama Shome, as Pooja Didi, is flawless as she becomes the voice of reason for Jeetu during his low. While there wasn't much for her in this season, we hope her contract demands a meatier piece for season 4. Coming to the kids, they excel in their parts and the arcs given to them. Having followed their journey over the last five years, they seem like your distant cousins living in Kota. You feel for them, you want to shield them, and at times take their hands and help them get loose. Unfortunately, in a bid to map the ups and downs in the boys' (Mayur More, Ranjan Raj, and Alam Khan) lives, the girls - Ahsaas Channa, Revathi Pillai, and Urvi Singh - get the weakest parts. This season, director Pratish Mehta took over the reins from Raghav Subbu. He definitely had an easier job given the characters and plots were already well-registered amongst the fans of the show. However, full points to Mehta for handling the therapy sessions sensitively without making it a hush-hush affair. 'Kota Factory 3' may be a black-and-white offering, but it adds just the right, and much-needed hues to the lives of students."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 21 Jun, 2024 Before diving into the film, let's understand what a 'rebound relationship' means. In simple terms, it means rushing into a new relationship without processing the breakup! Now, if you recall Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao from 'Ishq Vishk,' you'll notice that the actors have aged gracefully, but the storyline may not have. An adaptation of the film, titled 'Ishq Vishk Rebound' returns, exploring modern-day themes of rebound, love, friendship and heartbreak. In a day and age where the definition of love seems to be convoluted, 'Rebound' only adds to the confusion. Co-writers Vaishali Naik, Vinay Chhawal and Ketan Pedgaonkar capture this confusion well, but never seem to move beyond that. Meet Raghav [Rohit Saraf] and his friends Sanya [Pashmina Roshan] and Sahir [Jibraan Khan], who are your quintessential trio. While Sanya and Sahir have been childhood lovers, bonded by their mutual trauma, Raghav is the third wheel in their relationship. However, situations force the lovebirds to split, making room for a rebound relationship between Sanya and Raghav [who also had a recent heartbreak]. If you are wondering why Riya [Naila Grrewal] doesn't get much of a mention, it's because the writers also forgot to give her more agency and screentime in the movie. Co-creators Akarsh Khurana and Nipun Dharmadhikari's [of 'Mismatched 2' fame] love for Rohit is evident. Rohit is funny and has a lot on his shoulders to carry, but lazy writing doesn't help him. The director-actor duo carry their synergy forward here as well, so much so that Raghav feels like an extension of Rishi Shekawat [Mismatched]. Only Rishi is more relatable! Here's the trailer: What starts as a story about these friends, soon becomes about Raghav and his predicaments. There is no attempt made to address serious topics within the narrative. It is frivolous, to say the least. In one of the scenes, you see a blissfully unaware Raghav, also a writer, learning about 'couple therapy' from the fantastic Sheeba Chadha. As an audience, you finally hope to see something more real to be addressed there, but no, you are wrong! In another scene, Sahir and his dad's equation finally sees a point of culmination, only for it to be ruined by over-the-top cinematography and fourth-wall-breaking dialogues. For a moment as serious as that, the gimmicks used made it appear insincere. But, it is the non-judgemental tonality of the film that deserves a mention, but it is not an excuse for lazy work. Jibraan Khan, whom we have previously seen as a child artist in 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham', is charming on screen. Despite limited screentime, in moments of confrontation, he makes sure you take notice of his intense delivery style. If backed by good writing, the actor has the potential to carry off interesting roles. Pashmina, cousin of Hrithik Roshan, makes her debut as well. While she does pull off one or two scenes that require emotional gravitas well, junior Roshan has a lot of work to do. Naila's appearance in the film can almost be categorised as 'special' but she is one of those characters you really would feel for, had it been written enough! The songs are groove-worthy, but for a film that is one hour and 45 minutes [almost], having four songs within the narrative doesn't work. The major problem with the film is not that it makes rebound seem 'frivolous'. But, it makes a half-hearted attempt or resorts to tokenism to entertain. It is funny and cheesy, yes! But all of this without a soul, feels like a wasted opportunity. 2.5 out of 5 stars for 'Ishq Vishk Rebound'."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 21 Jun, 2024 Imagine a young child in the 19th century asking his parents why women wear 'ghoonghat' (veil) and whether gods can speak their language. It thus comes as no surprise that he grows up to be a revolutionary, fighting for the right cause. Netflix's latest offering, 'Maharaj', marks the debut of Aamir Khan's son, Junaid Khan , who plays Karsan Das Mulji, a journalist who dared to stand up even when the world and circumstances were against him. Jaideep Ahlawat also features in the movie, where he once again gives an impressive performance as the self-styled godman JJ. 'Maharaj' is based on the real-life '1862 Maharaj Libel Case' and has been adapted from Saurabh Shah's book of the same name. The film was set to release on June 14, but faced a delay due to a petition filed by a Hindu outfit for hurting religious sentiments. Following the case, most viewers already know what to expect from the film. It's a David and Goliath tale where the underdog Karsan Das, hurt by a personal tragedy, decides to fight against the atrocities of religious leaders. He uses the power of the pen to reveal how JJ had sexual liaisons with female followers, including minors, and how even men were expected to offer their wives to him as a mark of devotion. While unveiling the sad reality of these customs, Karsan not only fights against powerful leaders but also the blind devotion of the people around him. There's a moment where one of the survivors defends her predator, saying that's the only way to get a better afterlife. It may seem unrealistic to many, but it does highlight how gullible minds are manipulated by people. Given that the story is set a century before independence, you can't help but appreciate the courage it took for Karsan Das to go against such 'religious' beliefs back then. It's also a reminder of how we have failed as a society to eradicate these practices. On one side, we have reached the moon, on the other, we fall for anyone giving us false hopes of a better life and afterlife. Towards the end of the film, the narrator (voiced beautifully by Sharad Kelkar) mentions how Karsan's fight put an end to this exploitation. You can't help but roll your eyes, remembering how people still defend self-styled godmen like Asaram Bapu, who's convicted of raping a minor. When Karsan Das says that the way to attain salvation is through your deeds and not by satiating the sexual desires of these 'leaders', you want the message to resonate. But given that faith is so subjective and a sensitive topic today, you wonder if it can ever be taken objectively. Coming to performances, Junaid Khan, as a first-timer, looks confident and at ease on screen. 'Maharaj' is an unconventional and brave choice for a debut, and Khan manages to capture your attention. It's a boon for this star kid that he bears no resemblance to his father in terms of looks, style, or dialogue delivery. He does need slight polishing but is quite promising, especially when it comes to scenes that demand emotions, a challenge most young actors face. As expected, Jaideep Ahlawat once again gives a flawless performance. He is effortless as JJ, making you loathe his onscreen persona with his restrained performance and constant, unsettling smile. Shalini Pandey, in her brief role, tugs at your heartstrings. She also reminds you so much of Alia Bhatt. Sharvari Wagh, riding high on the success of 'Munjiya', is let down by weak writing. Her character, Viraj, who is besotted by Karsan's valour, comes across as annoying. Meher Vij, as JJ's wife, is credible as well. Ironically, the court sequences, despite being based on a real case, emerge as the weakest parts of the film. Junaid's performance seems a little theatrical there, and the monologue in the witness box comes across as preachy. The writer-director team fails to maintain the thrill and drama expected in such courtroom scenes. The music of the film is also quite average, but this project doesn't rely heavily on song-dance sequences. While the makers successfully recreate the 1800s, the characters sometimes appear more confident and extroverted than one would expect from that era, especially in matters of courtship and expressing love. However, full points to director Siddharth P Malhotra for ably handling a sensitive film like this. It must have been like walking a tightrope. Well, the grip did falter a bit, but he did successfully manage to walk across."

The victim was a journalist, and sadly for Arjun, he is best friends with CIB (or CBI, the makers have not really taken care to maintain consistency as the names keep changing) officer Aarif Khan (Sourabh Sachdeva). Now, Arjun tries to seek help from his twin brother, Karan (we did say this was filmy, didn’t we?) but is stuck in a crossfire with people from Kazbe’s (Anurag Kashyap) gang. Twists keep happening in the first episode, and without giving any spoilers, Arjun lands up in a web of lies and deceit where he needs to prove his innocence in the murder case and also find out the real culprits and the men behind the cross-firing on the fateful night. Director Aditya Dutt, who has earlier directed films like ‘Commando 3’ and ‘Crakk’, does a decent job with all the action sequences. However, what is missing is the soul in the series, and you are never really able to connect with the characters in ‘Bad Cop’. The chase sequences are actually good, but beyond putting a few twists here and there and some cat-and-mouse chase in the initial episodes, things do not really stand out. The series stops at being a masala potboiler that does not intrigue you. The screenplay is feeble, and the sequences are too formulaic for it to turn up as a decent thriller. The plot is just as messed up as one can guess, and it stops the audience from engaging with the series. Now coming to the good part – the performances. Gulshan Devaiah is sleek as Karan Arjun. The man has talent, and he is bringing it out in the series. He is effortless in his performance and his training for ‘Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota’ comes in handy for all the action sequences. In fact, he is a naturally cunning cop with secrets, who wants to get his work done without Devika (Harleen Sethi) meddling much in it. Harleen Sethi is a delight to watch, and she pulls the character of Devika with ease. It is not an easy character to play – a role where she has to switch between a torn wife who has to ensure that their daughter sees the family as perfect, and as the boss to her husband at work where she feels that he has shortcomings and incompetence. Then, there is Sourabh Sachdeva, the officer and a grieving friend who can go to any lengths to uncover the truth. He brings a certain charm to the character that he is playing. And then, there is Anurag Kashyap as the formidable Kazbe, the man with a space of his own. He has the presence and the persona that is required to pull off the character. It is a sheer joy to watch him in action in the series. Overall, if you are looking for a time-pass series that you want to binge on while having your lunch/dinner, this can prove to be a decent alternative. If you are looking for something more that will keep you hooked and on the edge of your seat, then it will come across as a disappointment."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Jang Ki-yong featured in ‘The Atypical Family,’ a gripping dramedy that explores the complexities and dark secrets of an extraordinary family. Known for his versatile acting skills, Jang Ki-yong essays the role of Bok Gwi-ju, a rather lost hero who finds purpose in his being as the narrative progresses. ‘The Atypical Family‘ delves into the lives of a seemingly ordinary family, unravelling their hidden struggles and the lengths they go to protect their loved ones. In an exclusive chat with IndiaToday.in, the 'My Roommate is a Gumiho' actor spoke about his role and how he approached the character who is suffering from depression. “I believe that although Gwi-ju is depressed and seems lethargic and indifferent to everything, he tries harder than anyone else to find his happiness back. So, I portrayed his depression in such a way that his current depressed state was not his original state, and from time to time, the bright 'original' state of his past was visible,” Jang Ki-yong told IndiaToday.in. Jang Ki-yong expressed his interest in playing a character with a unique essence that he hasn't encountered before and doesn't often see in other works. “I'm interested in playing a character with a unique colour that I've never seen before and that I don't easily see in other works. I think it's because he's a character I can only draw from my thoughts, without referring to anything else,” the actor added. ‘The Atypical Family’ explores unique family dynamics. When asked what he learned from his character's journey in the show, the talented actor shared, “We all have the same love for our families, just have different ways of expressing our love for them. It's also shown in the drama, but I believe it's important to have conversations. We can't convey our feelings just by thinking. We must talk and express them.” Jang Ki-yong shares great onscreen chemistry with his co-stars. Be it with Song Hye-kyo [Now, We Are Breaking Up] or Lee Hye-ri [My Roommate is a Gumiho], Im Soo-jung [Search: WWW] and now Chun Woo-Hee. Revealing his secret to building such a good rapport and chemistry with his co-stars, the actor shared that he tries to get close to them on a human level first. “Although the relationship between seniors and juniors is important, I try to get close to them humanely first. That's because, I believe, it makes the other person feel comfortable, and the atmosphere on set is relaxed. I'm grateful that my seniors and fellow actors think that's cute,” he shared. In the series, his character has the power to go back to the past. In real life, we asked him if he could have any superpower, what would it be and why. To this, Ki-young exclaimed, “The answer to this kind of question keeps changing, but for now, it's the superpower to fly. When I want to go somewhere for healing, even the time it takes to fly there would be healing.” When not working, Jang Ki-young shared that he loves running which helps him de-stress. “I've been running lately. I love the feeling of getting out of the house and running in the wind. It's a hobby I would recommend to many people,” the actor mentioned. Lastly, when asked about his interest in participating in international projects, especially in India, he replied, “I am always open to participating in good projects. I am an actor and a person, who loves diverse experiences and challenges. I feel very grateful to the many seniors who laid the foundation for many Korean actors to go global. I will continue to pursue a career in acting, believing that as I work hard on each project, another great opportunity will come one day.” In ‘The Atypical Family,’ Jang Ki-yong stars alongside Chun Woo-Hee, Claudia Kim, among others. The show is available on Netflix and has 16 episodes. The show has been co-produced by South Korea’s leading production house SLL, affiliated with JTBC. SLL’s collaboration with Netflix extends to shows like ‘Hellbound,’ ‘DP,’ ‘All of Us Are Dead,’ ‘Destined With You,’ ‘Narco-Saints,' and 'Doctor Slump.'"

According to a Daily Mail report, the young fan, named Timmy, was seen wearing a navy-blue suit, red tie, and blonde wig resembling Trump's signature style. Trump warmly greeted the boy, gifted him a signed $20 bill, and posed for a photo amidst a crowd of onlookers and security personnel. The heartwarming moment was captured on camera and the video has gone viral. During the interaction, Trump told the crowd, “I like that kid!” He also made a light-hearted remark to Timmy, who was overwhelmed with emotion on meeting his idol. “If your parents don’t want you, I’ll take you,” Trump quipped. The encounter between Trump and his young fan when the presumptive Republican presidential nominee made an unexpected stop at Tony and Nick's Steaks, a popular food joint in Philadelphia, in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. During his visit, Trump reportedly left a generous $500 tip and wrote \"no taxes on tips\" on the receipt. It was a nod to his plan for tax-free tips for restaurant workers, a move tailored to resonate with blue-collar communities, even in a predominantly Democratic city like Philadelphia. The highlight of Trump's Philadelphia visit was his rally at Temple University, where he criticised President Joe Biden's economic policies, citing a purported 34 per cent approval rating for Biden among Pennsylvanians, Fox News reported. Addressing supporters at the Liacouras Center's 10,000-seat auditorium, Trump said, \"Few communities have suffered more under the Biden regime than Philadelphia.\" Hitting out at Biden over the issues of crime and safety, he claimed, \"Under crooked Joe, the city of brotherly love is being ravaged by bloodshed and crime.\" Trump assured the crowd that his administration would bring \"law and order and safety back to our streets.\" Pennsylvania's significance in the electoral landscape is pivotal, with its 19 electoral votes potentially determining the outcome of the November election."

There were also civilian casualties, according to officials. However, the total number of deaths has not been confirmed by the Russian authorities. At least 13 police officers and three civilians were also injured in the attacks in Makhachkala. Five gunmen involved in the attack have also been shot dead, news agency Reuters reported, citing Dagestan's interior ministry. The two terrorists were neutralised in Derbent and three in Makhachkala. Russia’s National Anti-Terrorist Committee described the attacks as terrorist acts and stated that they have launched a \"terror investigation\" into the shootings. The authorities also announced a counter-terrorist operation in the region. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks. Both the synagogue and the church are located in Derbent, which is home to an ancient Jewish community in the mainly-Muslim North Caucasus region. The police post attack took place in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, bordering Georgia and Azerbaijan. ðèð·ðºRUSSIA: GUNMEN ATTACK ORTHODOX TEMPLE AND SYNAGOGUE Gunmen opened fire on a synagogue and Orthodox Church in Derbent in the Republic of Dagestan, leading to a fire breaking out at the synagogue.

As a result of the terrorist attacks, according to preliminary information, a priest from the Russian Orthodox Church and police officers were killed, Russia's National Antiterrorism Committee said in a statement. Dagestan Public Monitoring Commission Chairman, Shamil Khadulaev, told CNN , “According to the information I received, Father Nikolay was killed in the church in Derbent; they slit his throat. He was 66 years old and very ill\". The priest killed during an attack on a church in Derbent was identified as Father Nikolay and as per Khadulaev, the attackers killed him by slitting his throat. \"They slit his throat. He was 66 years old and very ill,\" Khadulaev said, as per CNN. Purported visuals of the attack shared on social media show multiple armed men in black attire opening fire at police vehicles and the public as they roam the streets. Among the wounded people, the majority are police officers. The synagogue, located in an ancient Jewish community in the South Caucasus and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was on fire after the attack. According to Russia Today , the gunmen used firebombs to set the building ablaze. The Governor of the Dagestan region, Sergei Melikov, said, \"We understand who is behind the organisation of the terrorist attacks and what goal they pursued\". In another statement, he stated, “unknown persons made attempts to destabilise the social situation. Dagestan police officers stood in their way. According to preliminary information, there are victims among them\". June 24-26 have been declared days of mourning in Dagestan, with flags lowered to half-staff and all entertainment events cancelled, the Governor added. The Israel Foreign Ministry, in response to the attack, issued a statement saying that the synagogue in Derbent had been burned to the ground and shots had been fired at a second synagogue in Makhachkala. It added that it was believed there were no worshippers in the synagogue at the time. The Russian agencies reported that street fights were gripping Makhachkala, the chief administrative town in Dagestan. In the 2000s, Dagestan was hit by an Islamist insurgency spilling over from neighbouring Chechnya. The Russian security forces launched aggressive operations to combat extremists in the region."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story More than 1,300 people died during this year’s Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as the faithful faced extreme high temperatures at Islamic holy sites in the desert kingdom, Saudi authorities announced on Sunday. Saudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdurrahman Al-Jalajel said that 83 per cent of the 1,301 fatalities were unauthorised pilgrims who walked long distances in soaring temperatures to perform the Hajj rituals in and around the holy city of Mecca. Speaking with the state-owned Al Ekhbariya TV, the minister said 95 pilgrims were being treated in hospitals, some of whom were airlifted for treatment in the capital, Riyadh. He said the identification process was delayed because there were no identification documents with many of the dead pilgrims. He said the dead were buried in Mecca, without giving a breakdown. The fatalities included more than 660 Egyptians. All but 31 of them were unauthorised pilgrims, according to two officials in Cairo. Egypt has revoked the licences of 16 travel agencies that helped unauthorised pilgrims travel to Saudi Arabia, authorities said. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief journalists, said most of the dead were reported at the Emergency Complex in Mecca’s Al-Muaisem neighbourhood. Egypt sent more than 50,000 authorised pilgrims to Saudi Arabia this year. Saudi authorities cracked down on unauthorised pilgrims, expelling tens of thousands of people. But many, mostly Egyptians, managed to reach holy sites in and around Mecca, some on foot. Unlike authorised pilgrims, they had no hotels to return to escape the scorching heat. In a statement on Saturday, Egypt’s government said the 16 travel agencies failed to provide adequate services for pilgrims. It said these agencies illegally facilitated the travel of pilgrims to Saudi Arabia using visas that don’t allow holders to travel to Mecca. The government also said officials from the companies have been referred to the public prosecutor for investigation. According to the state-owned Al-Ahram daily, some travel agencies and Hajj trip operators sold Saudi tourist visas to Egyptian Hajj hopefuls, violating Saudi regulations which require exclusive visas for pilgrims. Those agencies left pilgrims in limbo in Mecca and the holy sites in scorching heat, the newspaper said. The fatalities also included 165 pilgrims from Indonesia, 98 from India and dozens more from Jordan, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria and Malaysia, according to an Associated Press tally. Two US citizens were also reported dead. The AP could not independently confirm the causes of death, but some countries like Jordan and Tunisia blamed the soaring heat. AP journalists saw pilgrims fainting from the scorching heat, especially on the second and third days of the Hajj. Some vomited and collapsed. Historically, deaths are not uncommon at the Hajj, which has seen at times over 2 million people travel to Saudi Arabia for a five-day pilgrimage. The pilgrimage’s history has also seen deadly stampedes and epidemics. But this year’s tally was unusually high, suggesting exceptional circumstances. In 2015, a stampede in Mina killed over 2,400 pilgrims, the deadliest incident ever to strike the pilgrimage, according to an AP count. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede. A separate crane collapse at Mecca’s Grand Mosque earlier the same year killed 111. The second-deadliest incident at the Hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people. During this year’s Hajj period, daily high temperatures ranged between 46 degrees Celsius and 49 degrees Celsius in Mecca and sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Centre for Meteorology. Some people fainted while trying to perform the symbolic stoning of the devil. The Hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam, is one of the world’s largest religious gatherings. More than 1.83 million Muslims performed the Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to the Saudi Hajj authorities. Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, but the sheer number of participants makes it difficult to ensure their safety. Climate change could make the risk even greater. A 2019 study by experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that even if the world succeeds in mitigating the worst effects of climate change, the Hajj would be held in temperatures exceeding an “extreme danger threshold” from 2047 to 2052, and from 2079 to 2086. Islam follows a lunar calendar, so the Hajj comes around 11 days earlier each year. By 2029, the Hajj will occur in April, and for several years after that it will fall in the winter, when temperatures are milder."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Eight Palestinians were killed on Sunday in an Israeli airstrike on a training college near Gaza City being used to distribute aid, Palestinian witnesses said, as Israeli tanks pushed further into the southern city of Rafah. The strike hit part of a vocational college run by the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA that is now providing aid to displaced families, the witnesses said. \"Some people were coming to receive coupons and others had been displaced from their houses and they were sheltering here. Some were filling up water, others were receiving coupons, and suddenly we heard something falling. We ran away, those who were carrying water let it spill,\" said Mohammed Tafesh, one of the witnesses. A Reuters photographer saw a low-rise building completely demolished and bodies wrapped in blankets laid out beside the road, waiting to be taken away. \"We pulled out martyrs (from beneath the rubble), one who used to sell cold drinks and another who used to sell pastries and others who distributed or received coupons,\" Tafesh said. \"There are about four or five martyrs and 10 injured. Thank God, the condition of the injured is good.\" The Israeli military said the site, which it said had served in the past as a UNRWA headquarters, has been used by Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants. It added that precautionary measures were taken before the strike to reduce the risk of harming civilians. A military vehicle maneuvers near the Israel-Gaza border, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, as seen from Israel, June 20, 2024.(Reuters) \"This morning (Sunday), IAF fighter jets directed by IDF and ISA intelligence struck terrorist infrastructure in which Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists were operating,\" the military said in a statement. \"This is another example of Hamas' systematic exploitation of civilian infrastructure and the civilian population as a human shield for its terrorist activities,\" it added. Hamas denies Israeli accusations that it uses civilians as human shields or civilian facilities for military purposes. Juliette Touma, UNRWA's director of communications, said the agency was looking into details of the reported attack before providing more information. \"Since the beginning of the war, we have recorded that nearly 190 of our buildings have been hit. This is the vast majority of our buildings in Gaza,\" she said. A total of 193 UNRWA team members have been killed in the conflict, she added. Just after midnight, an Israeli air strike hit a clinic in Gaza City, killing the director of ambulance and emergency services at the territory's health ministry, Hani Al-Jaafarwi, and another medical staffer, Hamas media said. There was no immediate Israeli comment. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that the phase of intense fighting against Hamas in the Gaza Strip would end \"very soon\" but that the war would not end until the Islamist group no longer controls the Palestinian enclave. \"After the intense phase is finished, we will have the possibility to move part of the forces north. And we will do this,\" Netanyahu said in an interview with Israel's Channel 14. Israel's fighting against Iran-backed Hezbollah has escalated on the northern border with Lebanon, where many Israeli towns have been evacuated. Netanyahu said a northern deployment would allow residents to come home. More than eight months into Israel's war in the Hamas-administered Palestinian enclave, its advance is focused on the two areas its forces have yet to seize - Rafah on Gaza's southern tip and the area surrounding Deir al-Balah in the centre. Israel's ground and air campaign in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. The Israeli offensive in retaliation has killed almost 37,600 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and has left Gaza in ruins. Residents said Israeli tanks had advanced to the edge of the Mawasi displaced persons' camp in the northwest of Rafah in fierce fighting with Hamas-led fighters, part of a push into western and northern Rafah during which they had blown up dozens of houses in recent days. \"The fighting with the resistance has been intense. The occupation forces are overlooking the Mawasi area now, which forced families there to head for Khan Younis,\" said one resident, who asked not to be named, on a chat app. The Israeli military said it was continuing \"intelligence-based, targeted operations\" in the Rafah area and had located weapons stores and tunnel shafts, and killed Palestinian gunmen. The armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad movement said their fighters had attacked Israeli forces in Rafah with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs and pre-planted explosive devices. In Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip, health officials at Kamal Adwan Hospital said two babies had died of malnutrition. That took the number of children who have died of malnutrition or dehydration since October 7 to at least 31, which health officials say is likely an undercount"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story US prosecutors are recommending to senior Justice Department officials that criminal charges be brought against Boeing, after finding the planemaker violated a settlement related to two fatal crashes, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The Justice Department must decide by July 7 whether to prosecute Boeing. The recommendation of prosecutors handling the case has not been previously reported. In May, officials determined the company breached a 2021 agreement that had shielded Boeing from a criminal charge of conspiracy to commit fraud arising from two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving the 737 MAX jet. Under the 2021 deal, the Justice Department agreed not to prosecute Boeing over allegations it defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration so long as the company overhauled its compliance practices and submitted regular reports. Boeing also agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle the investigation. Boeing declined to comment. It has previously said it has \"honoured the terms\" of the 2021 settlement, which had a three-year term and is known as a deferred prosecution agreement. Boeing has told the Justice Department it disagrees with its determination that the company violated the settlement, Reuters reported this month. A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment. The two sides are in discussions over a potential resolution to the Justice Department's investigation and there is no guarantee officials will move forward with charges, the two sources said. The internal Justice Department deliberations remain ongoing and no final decisions have been reached, they added. Criminal charges would deepen an unfolding crisis at Boeing, which has faced intense scrutiny from US prosecutors, regulators and lawmakers after a panel blew off one of its jets operated by Alaska Airlines, mid-flight January 5, just two days before the 2021 settlement expired. The sources did not specify what criminal charges Justice Department officials are considering, but one of the people said they could extend beyond the original 2021 fraud conspiracy charge. Alternatively, instead of prosecuting Boeing, the DOJ could extend the 2021 settlement by a year or propose new, stricter terms, the sources said. In addition to financial penalties, the strictest settlements typically involve installing a third party to monitor a company's compliance. The DOJ can also require the company to admit its wrongdoing by pleading guilty. Boeing may be willing to pay a penalty and agree to a monitor, but believes a guilty plea, which typically incurs additional business restrictions, could be too damaging, said one of the sources. Boeing derives significant revenue from contracts with the U.S. government, including the Defense Department, which could be jeopardized by a felony conviction, one of the sources said. Relatives of the victims of the two fatal 737 MAX crashes have long criticized the 2021 agreement, arguing that Justice Department officials should have prosecuted the company and its executives. At a Senate hearing in June, Chief Executive Dave Calhoun acknowledged the company's shortcomings on safety and apologized to the families who lost loved ones. Last week, the families pressed prosecutors to seek a fine against the planemaker of nearly $25 billion and move forward with a criminal prosecution."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Columbia University said it has placed three administrators on leave while it investigates allegations that they exchanged unprofessional text messages while attending a panel discussion about antisemitism on campus. The university said the administrators work for its undergraduate Columbia College, which hosted the panel discussion “Jewish Life on Campus: Past, Present and Future” during an alumni reunion on May 31. The university said the college’s dean, Josef Sorett, informed his team on Thursday that the three administrators were being put on leave. “Columbia College is attending to this situation with the utmost seriousness,” a college spokesperson said. “We are committed to confronting antisemitism, discrimination and hate, and taking concrete action to ensure that our is a community of respect and healthy dialogue where everyone feels valued and safe.” Columbia did not identify the administrators by name and declined to discuss the matter further while the investigation is pending. The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news outlet, published images on June 12 and 21 of what it said were the administrators’ text messages. One included a suggestion that a panellist could have used the campus protests for fundraising and another that appeared critical of a campus rabbi’s essay about antisemitism. The panel about antisemitism was held a month after university leaders called in police to clear pro-Palestinian protesters out of an occupied administration building and dismantle a tent encampment that had threatened to disrupt graduation ceremonies. The police action came amid deep divisions on campus as to whether some of the protests against Israel’s military campaign in Gaza have been antisemitic. Some text messages allegedly sent by Sorett were among those published by the news outlet, but he was not among those put on leave. He will continue to serve as dean and is cooperating with the investigation, the university said. “I deeply regret my role in these text exchanges and the impact they have had on our community,” Sorett said in a message Friday to the Columbia College Board of Visitors. Sorett said he is “committed to learning from this situation and to the work of confronting antisemitism, discrimination and hate at Columbia.”"

An evacuation order for the Port-Cartier Institution was issued on Friday (June 21) and inmates were moved to other secure federal correctional facilities, without giving details. \"To carry out the evacuation, we put measures in place, together with our partners, to maintain the safety and security of our staff, the public, and the offenders in our care and custody,\" the CSC said in a news release. In an update on June 21, Quebec's wildfire agency SOPFEU said lightning sparked seven fires north of Port-Cartier and two were out of control. Across Canada, the wildfire season has so far been much less destructive than the record-breaking 2023 season in which more than 15 million hectares burned. However, the federal government is forecasting another hotter-than-average summer ahead. The CSC said the emergency situation continues to evolve and it was working on when it would be possible to reopen the maximum-security institution."

Her response, “Stay tuned”. But since making that comment in March, after she and Donald Trump voted in Florida’s primary, Melania Trump has largely refrained from public appearances. The few exceptions have included a couple of fundraisers in April and their son’s high school graduation. The former first lady noticeably did not accompany the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on any of the days of his more than month-long hush money trial in New York. She was not there last month for the guilty verdict or the following day for his remarks at Trump Tower. She also did not appear on June 14 at a 78th birthday party organised for Trump by his fan club, or at any of the campaign rallies he has held in recent months. Her absence during the trial and for other important moments was unusual, said Katherine Jellison, a professor of history at Ohio University who studies first ladies. But Jellison said maybe it should not come as a surprise as Melania Trump seemed reluctant to follow the traditional public role of a politician’s wife. As first lady, she also kept a low profile and was not a regular presence in her husband’s losing 2020 presidential campaign. “But everything the Trumps do seems to be against the standard playbook of how candidates and spouses behave,” Jellison said. Melania Trump’s behaviour deviates from how other politicians have relied on their spouses. Sometimes male politicians turn to their wives to try to reach out to female voters. Candidates also may be joined by their spouses as a way of giving voters more of a sense of what the candidate is like outside the political arena. During this year’s Republican primary, for example, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’s wife, Casey DeSantis, travelled with him, granted interviews and formed a coalition named Mamas for DeSantis before he suspended his bid for the nomination. Vivek Ramaswamy’s wife, Dr Apoorva Ramaswamy, also was on the campaign trail, often appearing along with their two young children to talk about the importance of family. The Associated Press reached out to 15 people who have been to major fundraisers or Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate recently. None said they had encountered Melania Trump on the Florida property. Her office has not responded to several requests for comment. Her only public statement of late came two days after the Florida Republican Party announced with fanfare that son Barron Trump, 18, was chosen as a state delegate for the Republican National Convention and her office said he could not make it, citing prior commitments. Reporters at the New York courthouse during Trump’s felony trial repeatedly asked him, “Where’s Melania?” but he never answered. Trump allies cited their son’s school calendar as the main reason for her absence without denying it was a delicate time for the family. Trump’s attorney, Todd Blanche, was asked whether there were talks about her accompanying him to court. “That wasn’t a discussion that I wanted to have,” Blanche responded, speaking to Miami trial attorney David Oscar Markus for his “For The Defence” podcast. “This was a tough case because of the nature of the charges, the evidence that came in, the history, how long it had been.” Some of the testimony aired about how Trump allegedly had sex with porn actor Stormy Daniels in July 2006, about four months after Melania Trump had given birth to Barron; Trump has denied Daniels’s claim. Trump’s former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen testified that Trump did not appear to care about how the story of an encounter he was looking to bury would hurt his marriage as much as he cared about it damaging his 2016 presidential aspirations. But Hope Hicks, Trump’s 2016 campaign communications chief, testified that Trump was concerned in 2016 about how a story related to Playboy model Karen MacDougal would be viewed by his wife and wanted her to make sure newspapers were not delivered to their residence. Melania Trump did not post anything on her social media accounts after her husband was convicted on 34 felony counts. That’s in contrast to Trump’s elder sons, who quickly condemned the verdict. Daughter Ivanka Trump posted on Instagram a photo of her as a toddler with a younger Trump and the message, “I love you dad”. Tiffany Trump, his younger daughter, accompanied him to the courthouse last month for the trial’s closing arguments. “I think it’s very hard for her,” Trump said about his wife, in an interview with Fox News after the verdict. “I mean, she’s fine. But, you know, she has to read all this crap.” Despite her absence on the campaign trail, Trump often mentions her and shares conversations between the two, showing supporters that she is still involved behind the scenes by offering feedback to the former president. Larry Snowden, president of the “Club 47” fan group, said he last saw the former first lady at a February gala hosted by the “Trumpettes”, a group of female supporters. He said he had never had one-on-one interaction with her, but that when he saw her there, she was “so charming”. “She was so happy, and she was smiling and accommodating anyone that wanted to come up and shake her hand or anything,” Snowden said. Snowden said he does expect Melania Trump to show face throughout the campaign and to make key speeches, but that he also thinks that the former president would “continue to be very protective of her.”"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that the phase of intense fighting against Hamas in the Gaza Strip was coming to an end but that the war would not end until the Islamist group no longer controls the Palestinian enclave. Once the intense fighting is over in Gaza, Netanyahu said, Israel will be able to deploy more forces along the northern border with Lebanon, where fighting with Iran-backed Hezbollah has escalated. \"After the intense phase is finished, we will have the possibility to move part of the forces north. And we will do this. First and foremost for defensive purposes. And secondly, to bring our (evacuated) residents home,\" Netanyahu said in an interview with Israel's Channel 14. \"If we can we will do this diplomatically. If not, we will do it another way. But we will bring (the residents) home,\" he said. Many Israeli towns near the border with Lebanon have been evacuated during the fighting. Asked when the phase of intense fighting against Hamas will come to an end, Netanyahu answered: \"Very soon.\" But the military will still operate in Gaza. \"I am not willing to end the war and leave Hamas as it is,\" he said. Netanyahu also reiterated his rejection to the idea that the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority run Gaza in place of Hamas."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power, could reduce the decision-making time stipulated in official policy for the use of nuclear weapons if Moscow believes that threats are increasing, parliament's defence committee chairman said. The war in Ukraine has triggered the biggest confrontation between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, with President Vladimir Putin last month saying that Russia might change its official nuclear doctrine setting out the conditions under which such weapons could be used. On Sunday Andrei Kartapolov, the head of the Russian lower house of parliament's defence committee, was quoted by state news agency RIA as saying that if threats increased then the decision-making time for using such weapons could be changed. \"If we see that the challenges and threats increase, it means that we can correct something in (the doctrine) regarding the timing of the use of nuclear weapons and the decision to make this use,\" RIA quoted Kartapolov as saying. Kartapolov, who once commanded Russian forces in Syria and now serves as a lawmaker from the ruling United Russia party, added that it was too early to speak about specific changes to the nuclear doctrine. Russia's 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out when its president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction or conventional weapons \"when the very existence of the state is put under threat\". Russia and the United States are by far the world's biggest nuclear powers, holding about 88 per cent of the world's nuclear weapons, according to the Federation of American Scientists. Both are modernising their nuclear arsenals while China is rapidly boosting its nuclear arsenal. Putin said this month that Russia had no need to use nuclear weapons to secure victory in Ukraine, the Kremlin's strongest signal to date that Europe's deadliest conflict since World War Two will not escalate into nuclear war. But he also said he did not rule out changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine. This was viewed as a nod to pressure from hardliners in the Russian elite who believe that Putin should be able to act more swiftly on nuclear escalation and reduce the threshold for use. Putin said again last week that the nuclear doctrine might have to be changed because Russia's adversaries were developing ultra-low-yield nuclear devices. Both Moscow and Washington made heavy cuts to the number of their weapons as the Soviet Union crumbled, but the Cold War arms control architecture has crumbled and many diplomats say they now fear a new arms race, opens new tab. The United States may have to deploy more strategic nuclear weapons in coming years to deter growing threats from Russia, China and other adversaries, a senior White House aide said this month. Russia says it is interested in discussing arms control with the United States, but only as part of a broader discussion involving European security and the future of Ukraine. The US 2022 Nuclear Posture Review, says that Russia and China are both developing their nuclear arsenals so that by the 2030s \"the United States will, for the first time in its history, face two major nuclear powers as strategic competitors and potential adversaries\"."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Millions of Americans sweated through yet another scorching day as temperatures soared on Sunday across the US, while residents were rescued from floodwaters that forced evacuations across the Midwest, including in an Iowa town where the flood gauge was submerged. One person was killed during flooding in South Dakota, the governor said. From the mid-Atlantic to Maine, across the Great Lakes region, and throughout the West to California, public officials cautioned residents about the dangers of excessive heat and humidity. In Oklahoma, the heat index — what the temperature feels like to the human body — was expected to reach 41 degrees Celsius on Sunday. (Photo: AP) In the Midwest where South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota meet, floodwaters rose through the weekend. In northwest Iowa, 13 rivers flooded the area, said Eric Tigges of Clay County emergency management. Entire neighbourhoods — and at least one entire town — were evacuated, and the town of Spencer imposed a curfew Sunday for the second night in a row after flooding that surpassed the record set in 1953. “When the flood gauge is underwater, it’s really high,” Tigges said in a news conference organised by Spencer officials. Governor Kim Reynolds declared a disaster for 21 counties in northern Iowa, including Sioux County. In a drone video posted by the local sheriff, no streets were visible, just roofs and treetops poking above the water. Reynolds told reporters on Sunday that more than 1,000 displaced residents slept in shelters on Saturday night. National Guard troops were helping with water rescues and transporting needed medications lost in flooding. “Businesses are shuttered. Main streets have been impacted,” Reynolds said. “Hospitals, nursing homes and other care facilities were evacuated. Cities are without power, and some are without drinkable water.” (Photo: AP) National Weather Service meteorologist Donna Dubberke said parts of northern Nebraska, southeastern South Dakota, southern Minnesota and northwest Iowa received eight times the typical average rainfall. And more heavy rain was expected this week. In South Dakota, Governor Kristi Noem declared an emergency after severe flooding in the southeastern part. Several highways were closed. Areas south of Sioux Falls, the state’s largest city, had an estimated 10 to 15 inches of rain over three days, National Weather Service hydrologist Kevin Low said. At least one person died in the floods, Noem said on Sunday, without providing details. Several rivers, including the Big Sioux, James and Vermillion, were expected to peak sometime on Monday (June 26) through Wednesday night (June 28), the governor said at a news conference. “I want to remind everybody to remember the power of water and the flow of water, and to stay away from flooded areas,” Noem said. “We’ve got a few days in front of us here that’ll be a little rough, but we’ll get through it.” Emergency management officials in the small South Dakota community of Dakota Dunes on Sunday issued a voluntary evacuation order for the area’s roughly 4,000 residents. Dakota Dunes is near the Nebraska and Iowa borders and is sandwiched between the Missouri and Big Sioux rivers, both of which are expected to crest in the coming days. Emergency management in Dakota Dunes warned residents that a mandatory evacuation could come quickly if flood barriers are breached. Little rainfall was forecast in coming days as high water continues working its way down the Missouri River, cresting at Sioux City, Iowa, overnight Sunday, at Omaha, Nebraska, on Wednesday, and at Nebraska City on Thursday, Low said. Minor to moderate flooding was expected along the Missouri River, according to officials with the US Army Corps of Engineers. “As long as the levees hold, we’re not expecting any major impacts,” said John Remus, water management division chief for the corps in the Missouri River basin. But elsewhere, the heat was the biggest worry. “It’s more important for people who are going to be outside to stay hydrated, because heat, humidity and low winds, even if you’re in good shape and not really acclimated to it, it could be a danger,” said Bruce Thoren, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Oklahoma. “It happens quickly.” (Photo: AP) The cities of Washington DC, Baltimore and Philadelphia all saw record heat on Saturday, with more high temperatures expected again Sunday. Lamont Cousins, who owns the Ampersea restaurant on Baltimore’s waterfront, said business had been slow this weekend. The 40 outdoor dining seats at the restaurant, usually packed this time of year, were empty until around dinnertime on Saturday. “I think it’s affected us because people are staying home scared,” he said. On Saturday, when he went to put umbrellas on the tables, it was already over 90 degrees. But Cousins said he’s not too worried about the lost business – and he expected Sunday would be better. “Yesterday, it was nobody walking around. It’s hotter today, but there’s a breeze going. Yesterday, it just felt like I was being punished,” Cousins said. Last year, the US experienced the most heat waves since 1936, experts said. An AP analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that excessive heat contributed to more than 2,300 deaths, the highest in 45 years of records. (Photo: AP) The National Weather Service warned of the potential for rare tornadoes in the Northeast later Sunday. Tornadoes on Saturday struck in Wisconsin, levelling the historic Apple Grove Lutheran Church, founded in 1893 in the town of Argyle. “The good news is we are all safe,” Dan Bohlman, pastor of Apple Grove Lutheran Church, said on the church website. Marvin Boyd, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Burlington, Vermont, said a severe thunderstorm warning was issued for parts of northern New York as a storm with wind gusts exceeding 60 mph (95 kph) and the threat of tornadoes headed toward Vermont near Lake Champlain. It is one of several expected to pass through the region on Sunday afternoon. “It’s an unusual alignment of ingredients for Vermont and northern New York to produce a threat of tornadoes,” Boyd said."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story US President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and his predecessor and Republican rival Donald Trump, are preparing for a crucial presidential debate at 9 pm ET on Thursday, June 27, in Atlanta, Georgia. This will be the first debate ahead of the presidential elections to be held on November 5 . The 90-minute CNN debate will feature strict speaking limits, a ban on notes, and no audience to provide reactions. Both candidates, Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are neck-and-neck in national opinion polls, with many voters still undecided five months before the election. Independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr did not qualify for the debate, leaving the stage to Biden and Trump. According to Patrick Stewart, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas, this debate format will push both candidates out of their comfort zones and require them to prepare for challenging questions. The debate will be a significant moment for both candidates, who are the oldest ever to seek the US presidency. It is seen as an important test of their cognitive abilities. \"It's an incredible test of their cognitive competence. This is our chance to see how much they've declined or if they've declined,\" Stewart was quoted as saying by Reuters. Biden is currently at Camp David, focusing on debate preparation with his aides, led by Ron Klain, his former chief of staff. Klain also assisted Biden in preparing for his State of the Union speech in March. Biden's team aims to highlight Trump's extremist policies on issues like abortion and democracy, portraying Biden as a stable and wise leader compared to Trump’s divisive approach. Trump, meanwhile, is opting for informal policy discussions between campaign stops instead of traditional preparation. The Biden campaign plans to underscore the stark contrast between the two candidates. \"What he wants to do is have that split screen, show that contrast, and have President Trump be forced to account for his more extreme views,\" said an anonymous strategist advising the campaign, according to Reuters. This debate will be a pivotal event, offering voters a clear view of the two leading candidates' visions for the country."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Chaos erupted onboard a Korean Air flight bound for Taiwan after a sudden malfunction in the plane's cabin pressurisation system left passengers suffering from nosebleeds and ear pain. According to a report by South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, on Saturday, Korean Air Flight KE189 rapidly descended from over 30,000 feet to around 9,000 feet, causing intense discomfort and triggering health problems for some passengers. The precipitous drop in altitude reportedly caused at least two flyers to experience nosebleeds, while 15 others complained of ear pain and hyperventilation. Although there were no reports of serious injuries, 13 people were taken to a hospital for medical attention. A Taiwanese passenger recounted the harrowing experience on social media, describing how the plane lurched downwards shortly after meal service, and the cabin was rocked by turbulence. She likened the experience to the intense G-force of a rollercoaster. A post shared by Chen Yi Ling (@nancy10in) As per a report by Dimsum Daily, the passenger reported suffering severe ear and head pain, along with dizziness, while children on board were left frightened and crying. The pilot made the decision to turn the aircraft around and made an emergency landing at Incheon International Airport. Korean Air has apologised for the incident and launched an investigation into the cause of the malfunction and assured passengers that all necessary maintenance measures will be taken. The rescheduled flight reportedly departed at 10:30 am on Sunday, around 19 hours later than originally planned."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story (NOTE: This article was published in the INDIA TODAY edition dated June 24, 2024) Foreign policy has been regarded as an area of success for the Narendra Modi–led NDA government since 2014—a sign of a confident India asserting itself on the global stage. No passage of events proved it more effectively than how New Delhi steered deep functional ties with both the United States and Russia, without one jeopardising the other. Its presidency of the G20 also saw India renew its old role as a leading voice of the Global South. New Delhi’s diplomatic skills were again on view this February, when the ministry secured a pardon for eight former Indian naval officers held on death row in Qatar. Closer home, as Pakistan extended an olive branch on the occasion of Modi’s oath-taking on June 9, India stayed firm on its stand of peace being contingent on cessation of terror. India’s ties with Russia, an old ally and a major source of energy, are seemingly at odds with its growing strategic alliance with the US. Balancing ‘principles’ with ‘interests’, India resisted US-NATO pressure to condemn Russia at the UN. In late 2023, external affairs minister Jaishankar visited Moscow to reaffirm “strong and steady” ties, signing deals on trade, energy, security and a nuclear plant. While relations with Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar are under control, Maldives along with Pakistan is the only other nation with an ‘unfriendly’ posture. The BJP’s manifesto also talks about preparing the diplomatic groundwork for the Maritime India Vision (SAGAR) and the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) to promote India’s trade interests. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE Strategic partnerships Deepening economic, technological, defence cooperation with the US and EU. Enhance collaboration with Quad partners Japan, Australia and the US for regional security and economic stability in the Indo-Pacific. Neighbourhood First policy Strengthening SAARC and BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) to foster economic/ security cooperation. Through Act East Policy, boosting trade, investment and cultural ties with Southeast Asian nations. Engaging with China Continuing the diplomatic and military dialogue with China to resolve the border dispute, defuse tension on the LAC. UN reforms Pushing for the long overdue expansion of the UN Security Council; leverage India’s standing in the Global South to address economic disparities and promote inclusive growth; lead global efforts to combat climate change and promote sustainable development. Counter-terrorism Enhance intelligence-sharing and joint operations with international allies and participate in global counter-terrorism initiatives. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Is India indeed headed towards democratic decay? If so, how will it chart a revival? What does Bharat Ratna recipient Karpoori Thakur’s legacy mean in today’s politics? Three new political books attempt some answers. The Republic Relearnt, Renewing Indian Democracy (1947-2024) By Radha Kumar Penguin Vintage, 2024 This analysis of India’s ‘democratic decay’ suggests that the Narendra Modi government has led the nation towards a ‘second republic’ by stealth. In a recent interview, Kumar minced no words in describing the prime minister as a ‘textbook autocrat’ who is set on a totalitarian path. Yet this book looks to the past for hope, sketching three earlier phases of ‘democracy renewal’ in 1977-80, 1989-98 and 2004-14 as portents that a fourth such ‘wave’ must be in store. Kumar suggests that the democratic challenge will come from the states, and given her chronology, the new coalitional compulsions facing Modi 3.0 must have quickened her quiet optimism. At the Heart of Power: The Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh By Shyamlal Yadav Rupa, 2024 Uttar Pradesh may not be a microcosm of the country, but if any state determines the political fortunes of the Centre, it is this. Veteran journalist Shyamlal Yadav’s timely book is a breezy compendium of the lives and times of the state’s 21 chief ministers, from G.B. Pant to Yogi Adityanath, and the shifting political fortunes they represent. Lest we forget: two of these chief ministers would go on to serve as prime minister. Yadav carries his grasp of the state’s political and social intricacies lightly, and the eventful careers of these often-colourful politicians makes this a fast-paced read. The Jannayak, Karpoori Thakur: Voice of the Voiceless By Santosh Singh and Aditya Anmol Penguin Vintage, 2024 This biography of the two-term Bihar chief minister and recent (and very posthumous) Bharat Ratna recipient Karpoori Thakur (1924-1988) is a deep dive into political history as well as a reminder of a defining period in Indian politics, the original dawn of coalition governments in the 1970s. The continuing relevance or resonance of Thakur’s legacy has much to do with the Lohiya-ite socialist’s role in ‘bifurcating’ reservation for OBC, EBC, EWS and women, prefiguring the later Mandal reforms. This somewhat worshipful account is enlivened with reminiscences from Thakur’s many political heirs including Lalu Prasad Yadav, and Nitish Kumar. A standout is the chapter on Thakur’s language politics—his fondness for Hindi, Bhojpuri and Maithili and his famous decision to ‘decolonise’ the curriculum by dropping English as a compulsory high school subject.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story (NOTE: This is a reprint of a story that was published in the India Today Spice edition dated May 2024) Morocco simmers, stews, and sizzles, in imagination, literature, and reel much as it does on the magical streets of its charming cities. With its epic landscapes and ancient mystique, it makes for prime road trip territory. This is where our journey unfolded; an experience that transcended mere travel to venture into the realm of the unforgettable. The idea: to odyssey through the vibrant landscapes and cultural tapestry of this ancient land in the Mercedes-Benz GLS. With the vehicles working not just as transport but as companions in a voyage of discovery and indulgence, we began our journey at Marrakesh with a grand welcome at Hotel La Mamounia. As the sun began its descent over the enchanting city of Marrakesh, the legendary La Mamounia unveiled her grandeur and elegance in true Moorish style with intricate detailing and unabashed opulence. Tucked away within acres of verdant gardens, our picture-perfect lavish accommodations came with panoramic views of the sprawling greens. If that wasn’t a sight for sore eyes, exquisite massages at the tranquil spa, followed by equally decadent dining options definitely were. Marrakesh to Dades—A landscape on the pages of history As the first light of dawn painted the sky pink and gold, the gleaming fleet of Mercedes-Benz GLS vehicles embarked on the first leg of our adventure, weighted by anticipation and possibility. The leisurely drive through the winding streets of Marrakesh—bustling souks, the Jemaa el-Fnaa square, and the kaleidoscope of colours that adorned every corner—was a momentary lull compared to the grandiose vistas and drive terrain offered by the majestic Atlas mountains. The Mercedes-AMG GLS 63 has been groomed to precisely negotiate this kind of rugged terrain with ease, its all-wheel drive and adaptive suspension ensuring a smooth and comfortable ride. Our journey was punctuated by historic landmarks and scenic viewpoints, where ancient architecture and panoramic vistas sat cheek by jowl to entice and excite. Lunch was at Hassan, nestled cosily in the lap of the mountains. After our sumptuous lunch, we embarked on a thrilling drive deeper into the heart of the High Atlas Mountains. As we ascended, the distant peaks that still retained traces of winter, shimmered in the distance with snowy patches. The Mercedes-AMG GLS 63 navigated the challenging terrain with confidence, its powerful 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine and responsive handling making light work of the steep inclines and hairpin bends. The active roll stabilization and AMG RIDE CONTROL+ suspension provided additional stability and comfort on the uneven roads. As the afternoon sun dipped below the horizon, we arrived at Hotel Xaluca in Dades, a luxurious retreat perched in the Dades Valley. Even though the rooms at Hotel Xaluca Dades were a delightful blend of traditional Moroccan décor and modern amenities, what I really wanted was to sink into clean sheets and a soft bed, 1,000 thread count cotton notwithstanding. Dades to Merzouga—A passage through time and terrain Dawn departures are almost de rigueur on any road trip, and this one was no different. With the desert sands of Merzouga beckoning in the distance, the wheels of the Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 4MATIC tuned magic on its head as we savored the luxurious comfort and refined performance as we traversed the starkly beautiful landscape. The Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600’s advanced air suspension made for an exceptionally smooth ride over the undulating terrain, while its opulent interior, complete with high-quality diamond-pattern quilting and ambient lighting, kept us in utmost comfort. The rear-seat passengers enjoyed the MBUX Multi-Seat Entertainment system, which offers a comprehensive range of infotainment and comfort features, including the “Hey Mercedes” voice assistant. Lunch was at Auberge Meteroid in Alnif, where the tantalizing aromas promised a culinary adventure almost as exciting as our wheeled one. As we made our way towards Merzouga, the landscape transformed, making way for the endless expanse of the Sahara Desert. Here, amidst the shifting sands and vast dunes, the Mercedes-Benz GLS 580 proved its mettle, effortlessly gliding over the desert terrain with grace and precision. With shifting sands on cue, and a GLS within your grip, dune bashing comes with the territory. The powerful engine of the GLS, and the agile handling it allows made it almost easy to subdue the sandy terrain. The advanced all-wheel drive system provided superior traction and stability, ensuring we could navigate the dunes with ease and confidence. As we soared over the towering dunes, the exhilaration of the experience was matched only by the awe-inspiring beauty of the desert landscape stretching out before us. It was a moment of pure adrenaline—an unforgettable highlight of our journey through the Sahara Desert. With the desert in all its golden glory, could an oasis be far behind? Hotel Riad Xaluca is a rich nod to the cultural heritage of the region. As the sounds painted our backdrop, we dined on sumptuous dishes prepared with locally sourced ingredients, savouring each bite as the sun disappeared behind the dunes. With an adventurous day behind us and a cool evening ahead, spent lounging in the infinity pool, luxury was a foregone conclusion. Much like with great food, memories from the road continue to haunt long after the char has scorched the tar. Until we meet again, Morocco, you will always hold a special place in our hearts.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story During the 10 years of the Narendra Modi government, the average number of train accidents has been 68 per year, a steep decline from the average 171 mishaps per year during the preceding decade-long rule of the United Progressive Alliance. But tell that to 11-year-old Sristi. On June 17, she lost her 31-year-old father, Shubhajit Mali, when a goods train rammed into the stationary Kanchanjunga Express near New Jalpaiguri in West Bengal. Mali was taking the train home to celebrate his daughter’s birthday. The safety figures, charts and graphs, churned out by some Rail Bhawan babu for his political bosses after every train accident, mean little to the families that are suddenly left without a son, father, husband or breadwinner. ‘Human error’, again? Ten people died in the accident. That includes Anil Kumar, driver of the container goods train that crashed into the Kanchanjunga Express, and a guard of the passenger train. Kumar’s employer, the Indian Railways, is blaming him for the accident. He had apparently not adhered to the established safety protocols. Kumar, of course, is not there to defend himself or tell his side of the story. But his peers in the railway unions have taken it upon themselves to clear his name. “It is not proper for the railways to blame the driver and tarnish his name when he laid down his life while discharging his duties,” says Shiv Gopla Mishra, general secretary of the All India Railwaymen’s Federation. Whichever way the probe goes, there perhaps couldn’t have been a worse start to Ashwini Vaishnaw’s second stint as railways minister in the third term of the Narendra Modi government. The myriad rail safety figures circulated by his ministry, and also the top offices of the government, window-dress a crucial data point: number of lives lost. Last year, train accidents in India killed over 300 people, among the highest in a year. The gory images of two trains lying derailed after the June 2023 collision in Odisha’s Balasore are still vivid in memory. That accident, one of the deadliest in recent history, alone killed 296 people. A lot of sound-bytes were expended at that time about drilling a hard lesson into those running the world’s fourth-largest railway system so that such tragedies never recur. The fate of railway inquiries Railway rules say even if one person dies in an accident, a full-blown probe by the Commissioner of Rail Safety (CRS) kicks in automatically. These rules were framed eons ago to imply that even one life lost in a train accident was unacceptable. But has the current crop of railway officers learnt anything? Cut to 2024. The CRS report into last October’s derailment of the Northeast Express in Bihar’s Raghunathpur is with the Railway Board. Five people died in that accident. The probe puts the blame squarely on shortcomings in maintenance of tracks, leading to the derailment. It also calls for action against senior divisional officers in charge of keeping the tracks in shape. It’s been months but nothing has happened. The railway ministry did not reply to a query from INDIA TODAY. But sources say now, turning the matter into a departmental fight, a section of the engineering wing is vying to challenge the CRS findings. It is not surprising, then, that moments after the Kanchanjunga Express accident, social media platforms started throwing up old videos of Vaishnaw explaining the virtues of the Kavach automatic train protection system. Holding two models of Vande Bharat trains, Vaishnaw is seen in the video explaining how Kavach automatically applies the brakes and averts collision—even from the rear. In the context of the mishap, though, it seems like cruel joke, commented some social media users. So, what happened to Kavach, supposed to be India’s answer to train collisions? So far, only 1,465 route km and only 121 locomotives have adopted the system. A wider rollout across the network, it seems, is taking its own sweet time even though there is no dearth of funds or political backing. What happened on June 17? The June 17 accident was so severe that several coaches of the Kanchanjunga Express derailed, trapping passengers and necessitating a large-scale rescue operation. Emergency services rushed to the scene to extricate the injured and provide medical aid. Vaishnaw, along with senior Railway Board officials, promptly reached the site. Initial investigations point to a troubling oversight on the part of the container train’s driver Kumar, who was driving through the stretch near Rangapani station in the middle of a failure in the Automatic Signalling System, a situation that brings into effect a special safety protocol of train operations. According to railway safety protocols, in the event of an automatic signal failure, a driver is required to proceed with extreme caution, maintaining a speed limit of 10-15 kmph. Additionally, the driver must halt at each red signal momentarily before proceeding. Preliminary findings suggest these protocols were not adhered to, resulting in the goods train making a Signal Passed at Danger (SPAD) violation and ultimately colliding with the Kanchanjunga Express. Data shows six other trains had passed through Rangapani station before the goods train, with all their drivers adhering to the safety rules. The Kanchanjunga Express too had stopped before the red signal ahead when the goods train rammed into it. Safety a systemic lapse It all echoes a similar train tragedy last October in Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh, where a collision resulted in the death of two loco pilots and 13 passengers. Train safety experts have repeatedly warned that systemic issues within the Indian Railways need urgent attention. The recurring nature of such accidents suggests a deeper problem related to the implementation and monitoring of safety protocols. The lack of stringent accountability mechanisms contributes to these preventable tragedies. The CRS has launched an investigation into the Kanchanjunga Express accident. But CRS investigations, although thorough, often result in recommendations that are not always acted upon with the urgency they deserve. The inaction stems from the fact that the final authority to accept and implement the recommendations lies with the railways itself. The situation underscores a wider problem: the railways acting as both the perpetrator as well as the judge, jury and executioner in these matters. What next? The Kanchanjunga Express collision is the first major train accident after the Modi government assumed office for its third term, having ended the previous tenure as one of the worse years for rail safety in recent times. Admittedly, much investment has gone into upgrading safety in the past five years. The Centre set up the Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) in 2017-18 with a corpus of Rs 1 lakh crore for five years, for replacement, renewal and upgrade of critical safety assets. From 2017-18 to 2021-22, a gross expenditure of Rs 1.08 lakh crore was incurred on RRSK work. In 2022-23, the government extended RRSK for another five years with a gross budgetary support of Rs 45,000 crore. However, all this matters little if precious lives continue to be lost in tragedy after tragedy. For Vaishnaw and his team, then, railway safety remains one of the biggest challenges going forward, even as the railways eyes feathers in the cap such as rollout of the first bullet train corridor between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. Compounding the challenge is the vastness of the network—approximately 68,000 route km. While a lot of work has been done on the safety front, gaps remain. Rapid implementation of technology to reduce ‘human error’ holds the key to putting the railways’ safety record on track. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story For Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) supremo K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), verbal aggression has served as a time-tested strategy to obfuscate issues and score brownie points. Not quite so anymore, with the Congress government in Telangana pointing out that ‘hasty’ power purchase agreements (PPAs) struck by the previous BRS regime with Chhattisgarh, soon after the party came to power in 2014, had crippled the state’s power utilities financially. The state government is to submit evidence on the Chhattisgarh PPAs to the Justice L. Narasimha Reddy Commission of Inquiry (CoI), which is probing alleged irregularities in purchase of power as well as construction of the Bhadradiri and Yadadri power stations during the BRS regime, detailing how the fledgling state had suffered losses to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore. This is in the wake of KCR, in a sensational move, targeting the CoI on June 15, and even asking the former chief justice of the Patna High Court to step down. In a 12-page written reply to the notice served by the CoI, KCR called Narasimha Reddy’s approach “biased” with “preconceived notions” and asked him to recuse himself from heading the panel. KCR also dubbed the CoI illegal and claimed it had no authority to look into PPAs and power plant construction issues approved by the Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission (TSERC). “If the political considerations of the current ruling party are unfortunate, more painful are your unbridled comments as chairman of the Commission of Inquiry at a press conference. Before completing the inquiry, your act of calling for a press conference, taking the name of Telangana and my name and extending the time for submitting the reply in view of the Lok Sabha elections as a personal favour have caused extreme pain to me,” wrote KCR in the scathing attack. Those heading a CoI interacting with the media is not new. In the Telangana region itself, back in the 1970s, former Allahabad High Court judge Vasishta Bhargava, probing the alleged extra-judicial killings of left-wing extremists by the police during the Emergency, had invited mediapersons to accompany as he went to a site in the Giriyanapalli forests in Medak where Naxalites had allegedly been tied to trees and shot dead. ]In a point-by-point rebuttal to the allegations levelled against the BRS government, KCR explained how the power sector in Telangana was in serious crisis at the time of formation of the state. He said the then Union government had incorporated the power share in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act by considering the power consumption statistics of five years prior to the bifurcation of undivided Andhra. According to the Act, Telangana was to get 53.89 per cent and Andhra Pradesh 46.11 per cent. The ratio was to be followed for the next 10 years—in effect till 2024. However, the power share allocated to Telangana was insufficient. Even considering the power allocated, there was a shortfall of nearly 2,700 MW. To worsen the situation, Andhra did not supply over 1,500 MW, violating the AP Reorganisation Act’s provisions. Also, with non-availability of 900 MW of power from gas-based stations, Telangana suffered a deficit of 2,400 MW. On the whole, there was a shortage of nearly 5,000 MW, leading to a severe crisis in Telangana. In this backdrop, the power utilities and the Telangana government worked in unison to tide over the crisis, and as a result, the installed capacity, which stood at 7,778 MW, went up to 20,000 MW. Strengthening of the power distribution system led to Telangana being the only state in the country to supply quality power 24/7 to all sectors. If the per capita power consumption in Telangana stood at 1,196 units in 2014, it shot up to 2,349 units in just a decade. KCR claimed that his government had signed the memorandum of understanding with Chhattisgarh as Telangana was in dire need of power. But officials explained that the government had ended up paying more than the market rate. Telangana power distribution companies had to contract a transmission corridor through the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) for getting 1,000 MW from Chhattisgarh. However, on June 18, documents shared with the media showed that the PPAs with Chhattisgarh had not been ratified and sanctioned by the TSERC. Whether power flows or not, the cost of Rs 638 crore was paid to PGCIL without power supply from Chhattisgarh. It also compelled Telangana power utilities to purchase electricity from the open market for an additional Rs 2,083 crore. Later, a dispute sprang between the states on power dues. While the BRS government said it owed only Rs 1,081 crore to Chhattisgarh, the latter claimed Telangana owed Rs 1,715 crore as arrears, for which it has approached the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity. What was anticipated to be a cost-saving measure in buying power ended as a drain on the state exchequer. Official sources said the previous BRS government signed PPAs without inviting tenders, resulting in a huge financial loss to the state exchequer. Though the BRS government had signed an agreement to buy electricity at Rs 3.90 per unit, the actual financial implications have far exceeded the cost. Effectively, it cost the state Rs 5.64 per unit. Further, the sources said that the TSERC had not given the go-ahead for these PPAs, raising questions about its legality besides financial prudence. In turn, this resulted in the demand to classify the payments made to Chhattisgarh as “irregularities”. KCR has also accused Congress chief minister A. Revanth Reddy of ordering the probe “with a clear political motive to discredit the earlier government”. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee working president and MLC Mahesh Kumar Goud has challenged KCR to substantiate his claims before the CoI. In yet another challenge, BJP leader and Union minister of state for home affairs Bandi Sanjay Kumar asked KCR to take the matter to court if he believed that the CoI was acting illegally. He also demanded transparency regarding allegations of corruption in procurement processes, questioning: “If there was no corruption, then why not explain the facts about PPAs.” “There was evidence of KCR’s willingness to go to any lengths to cover up mistakes and irregularities,” he alleged. On all this, the BRS chief is silent. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The BJP in Rajasthan is staring at a massive upheaval as discontent starts to come out into the open after the party’s dismal performance in the general elections, wherein it lost 11 seats compared to the 25-0 sweep in 2019 and 2014. Over the past few days, deliberations have been held to review the setback—chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 17. However, what has stolen the limelight is veteran BJP leader Devi Singh Bhati’s take on the losses. On June 17, after the BJP state unit was done with two days of discussions, Bhati blamed flawed ticket distribution, inertness in the organisation and former leader of the Opposition Rajendra Rathore denying candidatures to the deserving for the poor showing. Bhati may have made some valid points. In the assembly polls last year, Rathore had blamed his defeat from Tarangar seat to sabotage by Lok Sabha MP Rahul Kaswan. In this general election, Rathore ensured Kaswan, a two-time MP from Churu, did not get a ticket. This prompted Kaswan to join the Congress and win from Churu. Kaswan’s was the only Jat family the BJP had with clout among Jat voters in the Shekhawati region. His father Ram Singh Kaswan too was a successful leader, having won assembly and Lok Sabha polls a couple of times. Rathore, at one point, was seen as very close to Ram Singh. After their falling out, he ensured Ram Singh did not get a Lok Sabha poll ticket in 2014; his son was fielded as a compromise candidate. Thereafter, Rathore began losing Jat votes, and Kaswan’s ill-treatment in this election is thought to have drifted Jat voters away from the BJP in every Jat-dominated seat beyond Shekhawati. BJP insiders say that former chief minister Vasundhara Raje, who had succeeded in the difficult task of taking Rajputs and Jats along, had wanted a say in a couple of seats—Kaswan’s being one of them. Raje had also suggested that Pralhad Gunjal be fielded from Tonk-Sawai Madhopur to keep the Gurjar vote intact, but the party did not pay heed. Gunjal shifted to the Congress and put up a really hard fight against the BJP’s Om Birla in the Kota-Bundi seat. After Bhati’s statement, Rathore met Union home minister Amit Shah on June 18. Insiders say most state leaders are likely to shift the blame for the reverses on Raje. This even as Rajasthan heads for five assembly bypolls since some non-BJP MLAs have been elected as MPs. Even BJP ministers in Rajasthan are going public on the state unit’s failures. Agriculture minister Kirodi Lal Meena has not been attending office or using his official vehicle ever since the Lok Sabha results were declared, saying he is not keen to continue as a minister under the current circumstances. He feels the party in Rajasthan is in the hands of inexperienced and incompetent leaders, who are neither letting the alleged corruption during the erstwhile Congress regime being investigated nor displaying any vision to woo voters. Urban development minister Jhabar Singh Kharra has said the party failed to prevent ‘common cold from turning into pneumonia’, blaming the losses on wrong ticket distribution and the failure to counter the Congress. That the BJP could not perform as expected in the assembly and now the Lok Sabha elections calls for some urgent introspection. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader Indresh Kumar chose to blame arrogance in the BJP ranks for the poor show in Jaipur. Clearly, the malaise in the Rajasthan BJP is deeper than what the party may want to believe. With leaders’ patience waning, it’s open season for dissidence. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story (NOTE: This article was originally published in the India Today issue dated June 24, 2024) This financial year had started on a tepid note, with India’s merchandise exports rising only 1 per cent—to around $35 billion (Rs 2.92 lakh crore)—in April, compared to the same month last year. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war along with other geopolitical tensions, such as the Red Sea crisis and the Israel-Hamas conflict, also contributed to making the international trade scenario even tougher for Indian exporters. Despite all this, businesses are living in the hope that exports will start showing better growth numbers with improved demand from the European Union, the UK, West Asia and the US. Order bookings from these regions are up 10 per cent, claims the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), which is a sign of recovery for labour-intensive sectors, including leather and leather products, footwear and apparel. Experts also believe that the tariff war between the US and China could open new windows of opportunity for India’s export sector. However, there is a dire need to boost merchandise exports. India’s overall exports grew marginally to $778 billion (Rs 64.99 lakh crore) in FY24 from $776.3 billion (Rs 64.85 lakh crore) the previous fiscal. But, of this, merchandise exports, which form the major chunk, recorded a 3 per cent decline from $451 billion (Rs 37.63 lakh crore) to $437 billion (Rs 36.46 lakh crore). Services exports fared better, rising by nearly 5 per cent and acting as the key driver of growth. A comprehensive road map to boost merchandise exports is expected to be chalked out this term to address this major concern, aligning with the target of $1 trillion exports in the sector by 2030. The other key area to be addressed is the signing of the free trade agreement (FTA) with Oman, talks for which had concluded earlier this year. There could be a delay in signing the FTA with the UK though, since it is heading for election in July. Negotiations for similar agreements with the European Union and Peru could also continue, while talks with the South African Customs Union (SACU), Chile and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are slated to take place over the next few months. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE Address liquidity issues In such challenging times, both the flow of credit to and the cost of credit for exporters have to be addressed. While the commodities and freight prices have gone up amid a global slowdown and geopolitical tensions, clients are taking longer to make payments. Exporters need to get larger sums of credit, that too for a longer duration. Extend interest subvention Providing loans at cheaper rates to eligible businesses, it is one of the most effective instruments to remove cost disability of Indian exports at a time when bank rates in India are far higher than in competitor economies. When the overall interest rates came down, the Centre also reduced the interest subvention (assistance) for exporters. Now that the repo rate has risen to 6.5 per cent, the subvention rates should be restored to what they were earlier—5 per cent for MSMEs and 3 per cent for labour-intensive sectors—so that exporters can commit to long-term contracts. Facilitate better marketing Small and medium enterprises do not have the financial wherewithal to showcase themselves globally. The total marketing support corpus is now a miniscule Rs 200 crore, nowhere near the 0.5 per cent of the total exports that businesses have demanded. For around $800 billion (Rs 66.83 lakh crore) worth of exports, it means setting aside $4 billion (Rs 33,400 crore) for marketing. Trade connect In January, Piyush Goyal had announced the initiation of work on an e-platform to help Indian exporters connect with international buyers. A welcome step, the Trade Connect platform should be launched soon. Finalise FTAs India is expected to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with Oman in the first 100 days of Modi 3.0. Other FTAs need to be expedited too, including the ones with the UK, Peru, and the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union. The last will provide India access to markets in five resource-rich post-Soviet economies. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In a major demolition drive carried out after months, the Mandla district administration in Madhya Pradesh has pulled down the homes of 11 people accused of cow slaughter. All the accused being members of one religious group, the action has come under question by some. Mandla district magistrate Saloni Sidana said information was received about an illegal abattoir operating in Bhainswahi village in Nainpur tehsil in the district. A search carried out at the premises yielded bones, skin, meat and implements used in killing animals. The 11 suspects have been booked under the MP Cow Slaughter Prevention Act. One of them has been arrested while the others are on the run. Mandla superintendent of police Rajat Saklecha told INDIA TODAY that a preliminary report by a local vet had confirmed the meat and bones to be of a cow. Samples had been sent to a laboratory in Hyderabad for a definitive result, he added. Saklecha said police were investigating how cows were being procured for slaughtering. According to him, the accused in police custody had informed that the hides of the dead animals were sold to leather units and the meat to buyers in neighbouring districts. The families of the accused are crying foul that no notice was served before the demolitions. “We have been living here for almost 30 years. We did not get any notice before the demolition and a lot of our household goods have been destroyed,” said the wife of one of the accused. The spouse of one of the absconding suspects rued: “We have nowhere to go and no household goods left to carry on with our lives.” Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Yoga is an ancient science, but I feel it is more relevant now than ever before because of the physical benefits it offers. First, at the bodily level. Second, by coming in handy in the fight against environmental pollutants, to boost our immunity and to maintain our endocrine system. There are issues with all three in society today. For example, PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease) and PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) are a huge epidemic; respiratory problems have multiplied, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic. When scientists started looking at the effects yoga could have on Covid-19 survivors, they saw huge benefits, such as a remarkable improvement in respiratory health, better physical recovery, improved mental health, better immune system support and overall wellbeing. With regards to women’s health, yoga specifically works on the endocrine system and the thyroid gland. Yoga has always had relevance on a spiritual level, but it’s on the physical and mental fronts that its significance has become all the more noteworthy. Stress and anxiety are some of the mental issues that have cropped up because of lifestyle changes, and yoga is seen as instrumental in addressing them. If you can learn how to control your breath, you can control your mind, and if you learn to control your mind, you can control your life. I firmly believe yoga is the most important export from India. We are increasingly seeing the leverage it gives India as a nation, with the proliferation of centres and practitioners around the world. A result of it is how yoga is being celebrated across the world with International Yoga Day (June 21). Like many, I too am looking forward to International Yoga Day. Apart from sharing insights and spreading awareness about the significance of the day and emphasising the profound impact of yoga, I will be conducting online sessions for corporate audiences worldwide. My day will culminate in a special evening class at our studio. Yoga has left its mark in nearly every country. I travel around the world practising and teaching yoga. I am invited to do retreats around the world, and it’s amazing to see how yoga has reached the nooks and crannies of countries like Macedonia, Algeria and Syria. You have yoga enthusiasts not just practising but also teaching yoga, and it is giving them health and mental benefits and enabling them to earn, especially women. Women have been at the forefront of the yoga revolution. If you visit a yoga studio abroad, you’ll see that women have embraced and made it thrive. I really feel like this is a beautiful, almost feminist movement. Yoga is growing every single day. Classes are getting bigger. New forms of physical practices are coming in, such as aerial yoga, acro yoga, restorative yoga with props, yoga dance, chair yoga and face yoga. Now there’s yoga for teenagers and children, prenatal yoga, postnatal yoga, therapy yoga—it’s just incredible. I believe yoga is going to get stronger with time and its understanding and impact will only grow. I’m just elated to be at the helm of this movement. —Ira Trivedi has been a yoga practitioner for more than a decade.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Tall, stately, handsome on the outside. Soft, humourous, happy on the inside. A genial soul, a good guru and family man. Bharatanatyam expert C.V. Chandrasekhar combined many traits in one, effortlessly. He lived a life of 89 years full of dance colours; no wonder one found him in attractive and unusual coloured kurtas in public. Neatly combed hair and a ready radiance were his hallmarks. It is his overall aesthetics and dance stamina that inspired many. When he took to the stage and did a tillana or a varnam, he could put a 30-year-old to shame. His art sprang from discipline and dedication. Meet the redoubtable guru C.V. Chandrasekhar, popularly known as ‘Chandru Anna’. Born in Simla on May 22, 1935, where his father Rao Sahib (a title given by Britishers) V.A.V. Iyer, who was in government service under British India, and mother Kamala were stationed, Chandru Anna was among the eight siblings—two sisters and six brothers. As he was number seven, he was considered lucky! The early years were spent in Simla and Delhi. There was no dance in the family, though like in most South Indian families, Carnatic music was learnt and appreciated. His father was not happy with the Delhi culture and wrote to Madurai Subramanya Iyer regarding his lucky number seven son imbibing the arts properly. Subramanya Iyer recommended Kalakshetra in Madras. Thus, Chandru Anna found himself at Kalakshetra in 1945, where he stayed for nine years, till 1954. In the first year, he learnt only music from T.K. Ramasami Iyengar. It was only in 1946 that dance training began. Peria Sarda and Dandayudhapani Pillai were his teachers. When his father retired in 1947 on April 1 (four months before Independence), the family shifted to Coimbatore. Along with dance, Chandru Anna went through normal education, finished his high school in 1950 and BSc in 1954 from the Vivekananda College, all along pursuing dance at Kalakshetra. MSc followed, though in Benaras, and he finished with that in 1956. During this period of study, he had two significant opportunities: to visit Delhi in 1954 and win the inter college competition. And go to China, selected by Sir C.P. Ramaswami Iyer, as part of a cultural troupe. He attempted Bharatanatyam to Hindustani music to even Gujarati poetry but that was to make dance more acceptable and understandable in an alien setting. \"I never compromised on its grammar or content. I broke ground with Ritu Samhara; I conquered with Bhoomija. Under my wife Jaya's banner Nrityashree, we produced Meghadootam, Aparajitha, Pancha Maha Bhootam, Aarohanam, Govinda Biridavali, Bhanvar Geet, etc.,” Chandru Anna said. All above history and facts, I sat and gleamed from him on the occasion of his 75th birthday in 2010 (shared with readers of www.narthaki.com first). His three important contributions can be summed up as giving the male solo dancer a fillip, especially when senior of age, bringing dance to academics, and academics to dance. He took pride in his daughters, saying “Chitra and Manjari are very dedicated to their profession. In spite of being trained under us, their style is very individualistic and not our replicas.” Chandru Anna was modern yet contemporary in his approach to dance. In one of my interviews, he maintained: “Changes in dance and tradition will come; what is important is to have a firm foundation. The grammar of classical dance is its soul. Just doing some new fangled stuff on stage means nothing and is hardly even remembered. The beauty and essence of Indian classical dance lies in its tradition.” “Dance is my mission. I have been given awards that I value, such as the Padma Bhushan, Kalidas Samman and the Akademi Award. My students and wider family of dance love me and that’s my biggest reward,” he said. Wherever he went all loved him. Once in a workshop in Coonoor, he sang antakshari to regale students by camp fire. He was a quintessential artiste. They don’t make like that anymore—humble, happy and humourous. Pucca, professional, personable. No wonder the gods called him to dance for them up in Devlok.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story (NOTE: This article was originally published in the India Today issue dated Sep 21,1998) Have you ever reached the end of the road? I did, this past Sunday. It was 10.30 p.m. when the highway to Gorakhpur disappeared; literally. NH 28, which had brought me some 260 km from Lucknow, turned into a peninsula barely 10 km from Gorakhpur at Barwar, once a village. Suddenly there was nothing but the sardonic grin of the full moon above - and the swirling waters of the Rapti below. The river looked the very embodiment of tandav. Perhaps it was merely the lonely night; perhaps it was merely the policemen who told me the \"Rapti is 27 ft at the shallows\". Gorakhpur, the land of monks and mafia dons, found neither spiritual nor temporal fortification against nature, nature at its most raw. The rains had come in July; so had the floods, phase I. The second assault came in late August - and peaked on the 24th. When the clouds \"threw down their spears, Gorakhpur was an island. NH 28 had two huge gaps: one 700 m long, the other 175 m. NH 29 - the link to Varanasi, the other big city in the vicinity - had lost 550 m. Of Gorakhpur's 1,579 villages, 1,187 had been marooned. That was a fortnight ago'. That was when the waters climbed up to 10 ft in the city. That was when the spanking new planetarium was submerged - only days before its planned inauguration. That was when the Indian Air Force renewed Exercise FROG (Flood Relief Operations: Gorakhpur). That was when the army was pressed into service. That was when boats and boatmen were flown down from Varanasi and Allahabad to become Gorakhpur's improvised public transport system. It was one such boat which took me from Barwar to Gorakhpur the next morning. There were other passengers as well. Each was being charged Rs 10 by profiteering boatmen for a service which the state had provided \"free\". Yet, Barwar is lucky. At least its survivors - who live under tarpaulin sheets on the last stretches of the highway - can use the boats. 'Khanipur village hasn't seen even one. It lies - make that floats - barely 5 km from Gorakhpur and suffered collateral damage when the Nausarh bund collapsed on the evening of August 23. Khanipur's people stay on the state highway now. Since the \"waters have receded - from 9 ft to about 5 ft - the villagers are beginning to visit their homes, collecting utensils here, picking up fodder for the buffaloes there. The journey is excruciatingly slow. The 1,000 odd Khanipuris have one tube between them. The more agile can swim; others can only cling. How have they survived? Courtesy \"dayalu mahajan jinhone khana diya (generous businessmen who fed us)\". Why weren't they evacuated? Did they want to be evacuated? Not a chance. Nobody wants to leave home, not even if it's barely visible in a messy, slimy soup. As Wing Commander VS. Bharti - chief of the Daring Eagles, the unit whose Mi 8 helicopters have been deployed relentlessly in flood-relief manoeuvres - remarked, \"They just don't want to be taken away.\" There must be comfort in familiar surroundings. More cynically, there must be the belief that this too shall pass, as previous floods have in a region which is no stranger to them. Even so, this has been perhaps the century's most ferocious monsoon for Poorvanchal - as eastern Uttar Pradesh is known. In Gorakhpur, old-timers, very old-timers, talk of the deluge of 1932. The meteorological records, however, point only as far back as 1974. That was when the Rapti reached its highest mark hitherto: 76.84 m. Consequently, the bunds, roads and hutments were built keeping this benchmark in mind. On August 23 this year, the Rapti rose to 77.54 m - and all calculations went awry. Seventy centimetres: that's all it took for Gorakhpur's infrastructure to fall to pieces. It says something for 70 cm. It says even more for the infrastructure. Most local bunds are fashioned in mud - porous and easily destructible. Gorakhpur, as District Magistrate Arun Singhal tells you, has \"428 km of bunds\". To enhance them to more hardy \"boulder-lining bunds\" requires \"Rs 2 crore a km\". Yet, Gorakhpur's annual district plan is \"a mere Rs 30-40 crore\". It is so easy to smile a wry smile. Is Gorakhpur fated to be ravaged repeatedly? What do you say to the air force officer who wonders about the dehumanising process of throwing food packets at shrieking men and women day after day after day? How do you react when you're told that a local minister got his wife the contract to supply puri subzi to flood victims? Can you disagree when even government officials smirk that the preliminary estimates for repairing NHs 28 and 29 (Rs 11 crore and one month) be safely multiplied by four? Which teeth do you gnash when you hear thieves in boats helped themselves to houses as the residents sought sanctuary on the roof? There are scenes I will never forget - of that nameless little girl in Ekla village who kissed her baby brother on the embankment they rested upon. There are scenes Virendra Pande will never forget either. When the Nausarh bund fell, this farmer thought \"it was a cloudburst\". He rushed out \"to see people gripped by a terror I cannot even explain\". A petrol pump and a bridge were shattered before his eyes, the \"waters seemed to rise 25 ft\" and ripped apart the Varanasi highway. Only the great flood the holy books speak of could have done worse. Actually, let's reserve judgement on that. Gorakhpur's weather office forecasts heavy rain in late September. Perhaps the Rapti wants to overwhelm me a little more. DATELINE KAZIRANGA In her time, she must have roamed the length and breadth of Kaziranga's 430 sq km rhino country. She must also seen the disastrous floods of 1988 - and survived. But she was younger then. And stronger. After days of scouring around for food in the highlands adjoining the inundated national park, she couldn't carry her 2,000 kg frame any further. On a paddy field beside the road that she shared over her final week with flood-affected farmers, she lay down to rest on the evening of September 9. She never got up. I went to the spot early the next morning, expecting a picture of majestic death. What lay before me was just a bleeding boulder. Forest Department officials had scythed out the rhino's horn soon after it had died - to save it the indignity of being poached posthumously. Flies buzzed around the ugly wound. Children climbed onto its massive grey back. And Ganesh Ghatowar, the owner of the 4 cottah (3,000 sq ft) patch of paddy had a mundane - but eminently valid - complaint: \"Who's going to move this thing?\" Before the stench rises, forest officials say, they'll have to go to work on it with their saws. The cadaver will be removed in manageable portions. A drive, a walk, a boat ride, and an hour later we arrive at a submerged village on the edge of Kaziranga's Baguri range. The houses are empty, the villagers having camped by the tarmac of NH37 which runs along the park. So no one is bothered by the sickening miasma that is carried across the water. It comes from what resembles a little island. It's a rhino that was found \"upstream\" by Forest Department officials and had probably starved/drowned. This is an animal, mind you, that can really swim. Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) P.S. Das had told me the previous evening that rhinos \"could swim across the Brahmaputra\" (a feat comparable to swimming the English Channel). This one was in its youth. But it was also hungry and tired. Its carcass was carried by the only force powerful enough to accomplish the task: the flood waters. As our canoe circled it, the ripples caused it to move a little. Almost as if it were alive. Macabre? Morbid? Gruesome? Call it what you will, but the word is real. And reality has hit Kaziranga hard this time. Its hog deers, wild buffaloes, elephants and rhinos have had to fight three phases of floods that began in June. The previous time I was in Kaziranga, in July, one forest official said the animals were \"angry\" because there was no food. In the first week of September, they gave up the search. Some 18 rhinos have died as a result of the floods. Another seven have been poached. With 95 per cent of the park flooded, there were very few places to hide. They were almost room service for the poachers. See this in the context of a rhino population of 1,100 in Kaziranga and a smattering of another 800-odd one-horned rhinos in other parks in Nepal and India. And you'll see that there aren't that many one-horned rhinos (African rhinos come with two horns) left in the wild. See the damage with the benefit of experience. Two successive floods in 1987 and 1988 had such an effect on the animal population that it is yet to recede. The hog deer population of Kaziranga prior to those years hovered around 11,000. Now, even after protracted recuperation, the numbers are down to the 6,000 mark. As the water goes down in Kaziranga, the stench of rotting flesh will rise. But even then we will only get a preliminary report on the damage. Nature takes its toll. It also takes it time. Locked as it is between the Brahmaputra - which resembles a muddy sea during the rains - and the hills of Karbi Anglong, Kaziranga is a flood-prone area. But its tall fleshy grass is the rhino's preferred meal. It's also a great place to stay for a number of other animals, including about 80 tigers. Its problem lies, however, in the fact that in the case of a contingency like a flood the animals are forced to migrate to the inhabited Karbi hills. This means very little suitable food and a lot of predatory humans. \"We can do very little to safeguard the animals which stray into the hills,\" says DFO Das, \"it is outside our jurisdiction.\" Moves to extend animal territory have been very slow. Of the six extensions planned for the park, only one has been completed. For the 550-odd foresters who take care of Kaziranga, this past week has been a harrowing, sleepless one. Between yawns, they complain that the damage to the park's infrastructure - roads, artificial highlands for animals, camps for forest guards - could add to the toll in the coming years. With the park under 15 ft of water in many places, several forest guards were marooned on their tree houses and actually had to be rescued. Yet the state Government's annual allocation for Kaziranga (incidentally the logo of the Assam Tourism Department is a graphic rendition of the rhino) has been reduced from Rs 80 lakh annually five years ago to close to Rs 20 lakh at present. Even Central funds manage to hibernate in the state exchequer: in August 1997, the Centre released Rs 50 lakh for the park. Kaziranga is yet to see the money. At the Kohra range office, forest officials exchange urgent wireless messages: a wild boar speared by villagers; a hog deer paralysed by the headlights of a speeding truck on the highway-and hit; a rhino carcass found. It was as a result of one such wireless exchange two months ago that a rhino calf abandoned by its mother was rescued. \"This shows how desperate the mother was. Unlike other animals, rhinos follow their young rather than the other way around,\" says Das. He reckons the calf was abandoned because the mother thought there was no way it could be saved. Because she was found \"on the waves\" the calf was christened Laharani (lahar meaning wave). She was so young that she carried the vestiges of an umbilical chord. Now she roams around the office - no more than a foot and a half high, but nevertheless very strong - among foresters who have grown increasingly attached to her. Attempts to transfer her to the Guwahati Zoo under the orphaned animals scheme have met with tearful opposition. The problem is that Laharani is a prodigious consumer of milk (about 12 litres a day) and has high medical expenses. Unfortunately, tears won't pay for these requirements. Sometime in the near future, Laharani will have to go because the Forest Department cannot afford her upkeep. As I felt the hard surface of a nascent horn on her head, I wondered where it might end up if she is sent back to the flood-prone grasslands of Kaziranga. Two images came to mind. A disembodied horn in the Golaghat district treasury after an \"unnatural death\". Or in the dust of some oriental aphrodisiac. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Patna High Court’s ruling on June 20 striking down the Bihar government’s decision to raise reservations in government jobs and educational institutions from 50 per cent to 65 per cent has come as a significant legal challenge to the Nitish Kumar administration. In November 2023, the Nitish-led mahagathbandhan (MGB) government, which had Tejashwi Yadav’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Congress as partners, had raised the state’s reservation quota to 75 per cent, including the 10 per cent quota for the economically weaker sections (EWS). The Patna High Court, however, has set aside the Bihar Reservation of Vacancies in Posts and Services Amendment Act, 2023 and the Bihar Reservation (in Admission to Educational Institutions) Amendment Act, 2023 “as ultra vires the Constitution and violating the equality clause under Articles 14, 15 and 16”. Other than the EWS quota that was left unchanged, the state government had increased the quantum of reservations to 20 per cent for the Scheduled Castes, 2 per cent for Scheduled Tribes, 18 per cent for Other Backward Classes (OBCs), and 25 per cent for Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs). Besides triggering a debate, as the two state laws had gone beyond the permissible limits of reservations in India, particularly in view of the “50 per cent” limit prescribed by the Supreme Court, it also raised eyebrows in the backdrop of the established legal explanation that “adequate” representation of the oppressed classes in government jobs does not necessarily mean any “proportionate representation”. The Nitish government had increased the reservation based on last year’s caste survey, which established the overwhelming majority of EBCs and OBCs together accounting for 63.13 per cent of the total population of over 130 million (OBCs 27.12 per cent, EBCs 36.01 per cent). Legal experts, however, believe that though a state can exceed the 50 per cent limit in exceptional circumstances (for instance, to provide reservations to those from far flung areas of the country seen outside mainstream of society), it cannot align the quantum of reservation in proportion to the population of the reserved classes. This is because the only valid aim behind reservations is to secure “adequate” representation and not “proportionate” representation. As Nitish had left the MGB alliance to join the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in January, the ruling alliance had placed high hopes on the expanded quota to earn electoral goodwill. Having seen their Bihar Lok Sabha seat tally fall from 39 in 2019 to 30 of 2024, the ruling NDA appeared to be working to cover gaps in their caste support base in the run-up to next year's assembly elections. The increased reservation was a major tool that the NDA wanted to use to win the support of the majority. The Nitish administration had positioned the quota increase as a measure to enhance social justice and representation. As Bihar moves towards assembly elections, the court’s decision may have significant political ramifications since it may create a lack of enthusiasm among OBC and EBC supporters in the ruling alliance. The NDA had also been pinning high hopes on this expanded reservation bracket to assert their social justice credentials, besides usurping Tejashwi’s employment narrative with fresh appointments ahead of the assembly polls. However, the Patna High Court verdict can turn the tables. The state government that was moving with speed to conduct government recruitments in various departments to wrest Tejashwi’s advantage of job creation will be hamstrung because they can no longer offer the 65 per cent reservation bracket to numerically significant communities while making fresh recruitments. No wonder, Tejashwi has seized the opportunity in the wake of the Patna High Court judgment. The RJD leader, who is also leader of the Opposition in the Bihar assembly, has attacked the BJP’s credentials, describing them as anti-reservation and recalling how the saffron party had made every effort to halt “our (MGB) government's caste-based survey”. Tejashwi has reminded that the previous Bihar government, in which he was deputy chief minister, had made the caste-based survey report public and subsequently increased the reservation limit to 75 per cent, besides sending it to the BJP-led central government to be included in the 9th Schedule of the Constitution. “On December 10, 2023, during the Eastern Regional Council meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah in Patna, we also requested to include it in the 9th Schedule. However, even after six months, the BJP government has not done so. This demonstrates the BJP is against caste-based census and reservations. We consistently demanded this throughout the Lok Sabha elections,” Tejashwi said. Tejashwi has urged the state to immediately approach the Supreme Court for a legal remedy. “Otherwise, the RJD will appeal to the Supreme Court. We also request our honourable chief minister to meet the prime minister along with an all-party delegation so that we can strongly present our case for including it in the 9th Schedule,” he said. It will be a major challenge for the state government to prove that reservation expansion by the Bihar government falls within the exception carved out in the Mandal Commission case. The state government has maintained that they have increased the quantum of reservations in view of the results of the caste census. But then, the Supreme Court has earlier held that the State cannot fix the quantum of reservation simply in proportion to the population of the reserved classes. This is because securing “adequate” representation does not mean “proportionate” representation. The 9th Schedule of the Constitution includes a list of central and state laws that cannot be challenged in courts. While Centre still has the option of placing Bihar's laws in the 9th schedule of the Constitution, so that it is guaranteed immunity from legal scrutiny. It remains to be seen if the Narendra Modi government would do so before the Bihar government approaches the Supreme Court. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted a rise in occurrence of heatwave days this summer, with above-average temperatures anticipated across various parts of the country. This intense heat poses challenges not only for humans but also pets. Like us, our furry companions can suffer from discomfort, dehydration, and heat-related illnesses during summer months. Dr Bhoomika R., product executive at Drools, lists some heatwave care practices every pet parent should know. Summer nutrition: As dogs lack sweat glands, they are prone to overheating, particularly during summer months. This can lead to symptoms such as heavy panting, dehydration, dry and pale gums, and potentially even heatstroke. Wet food containing ingredients like chicken, egg, vegetables, spinach and certain fruits can aid in keeping your dog hydrated and cool. With approximately 80 per cent water content, wet food not only provides essential calories but also ensures proper hydration. Incorporating water-rich foods, such as seedless watermelons and cucumbers, into your dog’s diet can be incredibly beneficial. Additionally, yogurt, buttermilk, and coconut water are excellent additions to your pet’s diet. Hydration: Dogs’ bodies consist of approximately 60-65 per cent water, underscoring the vital role hydration plays in their overall health. Even a minor 5 per cent loss of water can lead to serious health issues. Water serves as a crucial nutrient, facilitating body metabolism and acting as a key component of blood and body fluids, aiding in nutrient transport and waste excretion. Dehydration poses a significant concern, especially during the warmer temperatures of summer. Providing an ample supply of water can help prevent dehydration and heatstroke. Placing water bowls at various points in the house, adding a few ice cubes to keep water cool, and scheduling walks during the cooler parts of the day are effective ways to keep pets hydrated. Paw protection: Protecting pets’ paw pads from scorching hot surfaces is essential for their safety and comfort during summer months. Walking them during cooler times, such as early morning or late evening, helps avoid burns and infections, ensuring a pleasant outdoor experience for your furry companions. Activity: Water play is a popular summer activity for pets. Whether it is enjoying a pool or visiting a dog-friendly beach, many pets love splashing around in the water. Always supervise your pet, as water temperatures can become uncomfortably hot. To prevent skin irritation, ensure you give them a good rinse and dry after swimming. Another way to keep pets engaged is through interactive toys, stimulating their minds and providing physical exercise without overwhelming them. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Lok Sabha elections just over, Jharkhand is gearing up for another electoral battle. With assembly polls scheduled in November, the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM)-led alliance, headed by chief minister Champai Soren whereas his party is politically helmed by Hemant Soren’s wife Kalpana Soren, faces a significant challenge. Champai Soren assumed office in February following the arrest of his predecessor, Hemant Soren, by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in an alleged land scam. His tenure has been a mixed bag in terms of electoral success. While the Opposition BJP lost all five Lok Sabha seats reserved for Scheduled Castes, the saffron alliance managed to secure the remaining nine seats in the state. Top JMM sources say they have zeroed in on two main challenges. Firstly, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) still seems to have substantial support. Secondly, the JMM can no longer dismiss the corruption allegations levelled against the government as a non-issue. The strategy then is not just to earn the goodwill of the people but also demonstrate a firm stance against corruption to counter the BJP’s narrative. Champai Soren has directed officials to fill nearly 40,000 vacant government posts by September, a move aimed at consolidating support and demonstrating effective governance. Meanwhile, Congress leader Alamgir Alam, currently in judicial custody following his arrest by the ED in an alleged tender scam, submitted his resignation from the Champai Soren cabinet. According to JMM sources, Alam was nudged by his superiors to step down. Alam, who was also handling the rural development, parliamentary affairs, rural works and panchayati raj departments, finally resigned over three weeks after his arrest on May 15. Prior to Alam’s arrest, the ED had arrested Alam’s officer on special duty Sanjiv Kumar Lal and the latter’s domestic help on May 6, following the seizure of more than Rs 32 crore from a flat allegedly linked to them. The ED has accused Alam of allegedly receiving a 1.5 per cent commission as kickbacks on every tender in his department. The silver lining for Champai Soren and his government lies in Jharkhand’s demographics. With over 26 per cent of the electorate comprising Scheduled Tribes and 28 of the 81 assembly seats reserved for tribal candidates, the JMM seems to have a significant cushion. Since November 2019, when Hemant Soren took over as chief minister, the JMM is understood to have earned the goodwill of the tribal population, which could prove advantageous in the upcoming elections. The JMM’s equation with the tribal communities has been bolstered by a series of strategic policies. Apart from tribal discontent against the BJP over Hemant Soren’s arrest, the JMM has resonated with the tribal populace by implementing a domicile policy rooted in the 1932 Khatiyan (land record), which advocates for “100 per cent job opportunities for the native tribals and moolvasis”. Additionally, their persistent push for recognition of the Sarna religion aims to officially acknowledge the unique religious identity of the nature-worshipping tribal community. This stance has found new support bases among the tribal population, serving as a counter to the BJP’s narrative that categorises all tribes as ‘essentially Hindu’. The JMM’s pursuit of separate recognition for the Sarna religion is a strategic manoeuvre to distinguish itself from the BJP’s broader classification of tribal groups. However, Champai Soren is acutely aware that relying solely on tribal support may not suffice in securing a decisive victory. He has affirmed the government’s commitment to providing jobs for the youth, pledging that vacancies in government departments would be filled as soon as possible. Champai Soren has also inquired about the status of various competitive examinations in the state. Aware of previous instances of paper leaks, he stressed the importance of maintaining confidentiality and transparency in the examination process. As Jharkhand heads towards assembly elections, the Champai Soren government is racing against time to deliver on its promises and consolidate its position. The state’s political landscape remains dynamic, and the coming months will be crucial in determining the JMM’s standing amidst the evolving electoral scenario. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Archaeologists have discovered a centuries-old temple of Lord Shiva dating back to the Chalukyan period at Hottal in Degloor taluka in Nanded, Maharashtra. Hottal, located over 100 km from Nanded, is known for its ancient temples. It also has three inscriptions dating to the Kalyani Chalukya period. The Kalyani Chalukyas, or the Western Chalukyas, ruled from present-day Bidar district in Karnataka. The state government’s archaeologists are undertaking conservation work at a temple at the site over the past few months. Hottal has several temples dedicated to deities, such as the Siddheshwar temple, Parvati temple, Parmeshwar Mahadeva temple, and the Nandi mandir and kunda (pond with a sacred value). The temples in Hottal are estimated to date to the 10-11th century and may have been built during the reign of the Kalyani Chalukyas. The team of archaeologists came across the remains while working on the conservation project. The base of the Shiva temple has been unearthed. “The lower part of the temple was covered with soil. We began undertaking scientific clearances at the site and came across the remains of this temple,” said Amol Gote, assistant director, Directorate of Museums and Archaeology, Maharashtra. The archaeologists have so far found that the temple has one sabha-mandap (hall) and two garbha-grihas (sanctum sanctorum). Further excavations may reveal if the shrine had another garbha-griha. Gote added that they had also found a shiva linga, idols, sculptures, carvings, and shards and pieces of bricks at the site. Temples with one sabha-mandap and two sanctums are called ‘ dwidal ’ temples, and those with one sabha-mandap and three garbha-grihas are called ‘tridal’ temples. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

Wherever there is litigation about the interpretation of the rules which has held up such appointments, the rules must be amended forthwith. â Set up a joint committee of MPs and some eminent jurists to draft within 60 days a judicial appointments committee bill. This committee must present a blueprint for a judicial appointments committee. It should also examine the current tension between the existing Government and the constitutional courts and give a report, if necessary, suggesting any measures of course correction that could obviate this in the future. â Set up a committee to recast the Criminal Procedure Code to ensure: > The present system of trial by embarrassment is done away with. There must be full confidentiality in criminal investigation until charges are filed in court. > Bail—not jail—the principle enunciated by the Supreme Court (except in cases of violent crime such as murder, terrorism, etc.) is once again the norm. TO DO IN 100 DAYS â Set up an overarching judicial appointments committee that will have the power to appoint judges and to entertain complaints against judges. This should be a robust committee, the constitution of which enjoys public confidence. â Appoint a task force to implement the commercial courts bill. â Amend the legal services law obliging every department of the government to appoint retired district/high court judges as umpires to resolve disputes with citizens. The decision given by the umpire should be binding on the government— but not on the citizen. â Appoint a committee to make a legal aid law that is adequately funded, partly from fees that can be earned in the commercial court, and partly by revising the paltry court fee charged in Indian courts. This law would be structured in a way that impecunious litigants get good legal assistance and young lawyers get a decent fee and experience in litigation. â Appoint a judicial reforms committee that will have the task of ensuring that: > All the reports of the committees appointed have been received in good time, analysed and placed before the Houses of Parliament. > All steps that can be taken by the executive government to implement these measures of reform are duly taken in a timely fashion, and > Wherever necessary, the government takes steps to obtain legislative sanction of Parliament to implement these measures. SEE THROUGH IN ONE YEAR â An external expert be appointed to re-appraise the machinery of the justice system. The tasks would include the following: > Assess the revised judge strength necessary to make the courts effective, and measures necessary to fix the problem of shortfall. > Suggest ways and means of upgrading the infrastructure and thereby improving efficiency of the courts. â Computerise land and other government records. Computerise all courts. â Review all the regulatory mechanisms and tribunals created under the various laws. An external expert should be appointed to: > Examine steps to make the tribunals more effective, including improving their infrastructure. > Suggest a method of identifying and appointing personnel with the requisite domain knowledge so that tribunals can truly function as an expert regulator. COMPLETE IN THREE YEARS â ‘Spring cleaning’ of old pending cases not yet disposed of by: > Referring civil cases at the option of the party suffering an interim order—or has failed to secure an interim order—to mediation or arbitration. > Amending the criminal law—most offences should be made compoundable as long as the court is satisfied that it in the interest of justice. â Appoint a task force to examine the Law Commission reports for correction in the laws, and suggest measures to implement them. â Put in place a continuing professional development programme where judges and lawyers are compelled to attend sessions that would upgrade their knowledge, including familiarising them with developments in commercial laws in other countries. â Appoint an accountability ombudsman to whom any aggrieved citizen subjected to arbitrary assessments by tax authorities can file a complaint. If the complaints are found to be valid, appropriate action be taken against errant officials. â Make a law whereby allegations of defamation by the electronic media can, at the option of the citizen, be heard by a panel comprising a judge and members from the media. Let the media be judged by a jury of its peers. If defamation is established, the panel should have statutory powers of awarding damages and also injunctions. —The writer is a senior Supreme Court lawyer Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Competitive entrance examinations, of any nature, always lay the groundwork for a successful career and determine the strength and ability of aspirants. Evaluating candidates on parameters such as rational and analytical thought process, critical thinking, knowledge comprehension skills, general knowledge, and intelligent and emotional quotient are tools used by the testing authorities most of the time. But what happens if the testing agencies come under the radar with their authenticity, conduct and safety of such competitive examinations questioned. Something similar seems to be the case with the National Testing Agency (NTA), which conducts two highly competitive national exams—the NEET-UG and UGC-NET. The NEET-UG 2024, an exam conducted by the NTA for admissions to MBBS, BDS and other medical courses in government and private colleges, is already marred by controversies. Now, the UGC-NET 2024 has also come in the firing line. A test for those keen to make a career in the field of academics and research, the UGC-NET (University Grants Commission-National Eligibility Test) determines the eligibility of candidates for lectureship in the Indian universities and colleges. In a sudden development, the UGC-NET 2024 exam conducted on June 18 got cancelled the next day by the NTA. Citing ‘the exam integrity was compromised’ as the reason, the Union ministry of education announced cancellation of the examination and that a fresh examination will be held. The decision was taken after the UGC received inputs indicating that the integrity of the examination may have been compromised. The UGC-NET 2024 exam was taken by over 900,000 candidates, out of which 473,484 took it in the first shift and 435,096 in the second shift. Let’s take a look at the importance of the UGC-NET exam and what all it entails. Conducted by the NTA on behalf of the UGC, the national level computer-based exam (though it was done offline this year) is conducted twice a year—June and December—and is mandatory for those who want to pursue teaching and research-oriented careers. “A prestigious exam for postgraduate students and young researchers in India, clearing the UGC-NET exam opens up numerous benefits for candidates, including the eligibility for assistant professor roles at universities and colleges, access to the prestigious junior research fellowship (JRF) that provides financial support for doctoral studies, and a pathway to admission into PhD programmes at premier institutions,” says Anil Nagar, founder and CEO, Adda247, an online coaching platform for competitive exams, including the UGC-NET. Valuedy b academics for its ability to identify candidates with a strong subject knowledge and research aptitude, the UGC-NET has a selection rate of 6 per cent and is unarguably one of the toughest and most coveted exams in India. “Candidates who have qualified the UGC-NET may also work as researchers and analysts for companies for better career opportunities and lucrative pay packages,” adds Nagar. The exam, divided into two papers, mainly consists of MCQs (multiple choice questions) and is to be completed in three hours. The first paper has 50 questions for total marks of 100 and is of one-hour duration. The second paper has 100 questions for total of 200 marks and the duration is two hours. There is no negative marking and the exam can be taken in English or Hindi. The two papers have a different syllabus and check candidates on multiple aspects. The first paper, with 10 sections compulsory for all candidates, tests one for their teaching, research and general aptitude besides other factors such as reading comprehension, communication, reasoning (including mathematic), data interpretation, and policy and administration to name a few. The second paper covers subject-specific questions from the subject chosen during the application process itself. In order to be eligible to sit for the UGC-NET exam, it’s mandatory for general category candidates to have a minimum qualifying score of 55 per cent in their masters and 50 per cent for those from the reserved categories, such as Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. “Those pursuing a master’s degree or awaiting final results can also apply, but they must obtain the minimum marks within two years of taking the exam,” explains Nagar. Candidates with a four-year bachelor’s degree must have at least 75 per cent marks (70 per cent for reserved categories). While the upper age limit for (JRF) position is 30 years, there is no age limit for the assistant professor’s position. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story (NOTE: This article was published in the INDIA TODAY edition dated June 24, 2024) India’s 63 million Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) contribute a significant 29 per cent to its GDP and 44 per cent to exports and thus are integral to the country’s journey towards becoming a ‘Viksit Bharat’. However, these businesses have faced successive disruptions, beginning from demonetisation in 2016. The Covid-19 pandemic and then geopolitical disturbances like the Russia-Ukraine war, Israel-Hamas conflict and Red Sea crisis have led to business closures, supply chain disruptions, logistics cost spikes and volatile input costs. Consequently, many MSMEs faced losses due to damaged inventory and forgone sales. “In today’s globalised environment,” notes Anil Bhardwaj, secretary-general, Federation of Indian MSMEs, “institutional responses must consider the impact of geopolitical developments on small businesses.” And that precisely is the task that Jitan Ram Manjhi and his ministry have to embark on forthwith. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE Timely payment Delayed payments—courtesy both the PSUs as well as private enterprises—have been the sector’s bane, impeding efforts to raise capital and scale up. Reforms should focus on speeding up arbitration. Support mechanism A dedicated disaster support mechanism should be established to provide swift assistance during crises. It could include emergency grants, fast-tracked export clearances, logistical support and consular assistance. Look East Current policies are still heavily focused on the West. With Asia’s share of global GDP projected to reach 60 per cent, it’s crucial to reorient trade promotion efforts towards this region. Restructuring A liberal restructuring option should be given to MSMEs affected by the pandemic and wars. Currently, if MSME accounts that have exposure of over Rs 5 crore fail to repay EMIs on time, they are blacklisted, affecting their access to financial services. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story (NOTE: This article was published in the INDIA TODAY edition dated June 1, 2024) There seems to be no end to the troubles at the National Testing Agency (NTA), which conducts major entrance examinations in the country and holds the fate of millions of students in its hands. Over three million have been left hanging with the controver­sies surrounding two big examinations—the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (Undergraduate) or NEET-UG, the gateway for admissions to medical courses in India, and the University Grants Commission-National Eligibility Test (UGC-NET), the key qualification for those hoping to find teaching jobs in colleges or to get junior research fellowships. While the NEET exercise is facing allegations of inflated marking and paper leaks since results were announced on June 4, the UGC-NET exam, taken by 900,000 candidates across 317 cities on June 19, was cancelled the same night after the Union ministry of education (MoE) received inputs from the home affairs ministry (MoH) about the ‘integrity of the examination being compromised’. The investigation into the UGC-NET fiasco will now be handed over to the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation), while it is the various state authorities that are still handling the probe into the alleged NEET paper leaks. The political ramifications of the mess are still unravelling. Union home minister Amit Shah was in a huddle with his counterparts in the education and health ministries, Dharmendra Pradhan and J.P. Nadda respectively, as well as officials from the Prime Minister’s Office to decide the next course of action. The Opposition, meanwhile, has called for a nationwide protest on June 21. For students, the rising uncertainty and loss of faith in the system has been heartbreaking. Suni Sharma from Delhi has wanted to be a doctor for as long as she can remember. So strong was her conviction that her security guard-nurse parents sold their wedding jewellery and pooled in some of their retirement savings to send her to a coaching institute in Kota so that she could crack the NEET. The 17-year-old says she studied 10-15 hours a day for two years, took some 40 mock exams to prepare for the test held on May 5 this year. But when the results came out on June 4, she was shocked. Despite scoring 550 marks out of 720, her rank was in the 100,000-plus range, nowhere near enough for her to get into a decent medical college. “I haven’t been able to sleep or eat in the past two weeks,” says Suni, now one of thousands of students protesting the NEET results in the capital. “Nobody will be able to understand how much hard work goes into scoring these marksâæand then to not get a seat because of corruption.” A score of 550 would have got Suni a rank between 40,000 and 46,000 last year, enough to get her an MBBS seat in a good college. This year, 2.4 million students across 4,750 centres in 571 cities took the test, some 400,000 more than in 2023. An unprecedented number—67 students— scored full marks, 720, compared to just two students last year and none in 2022. Six of these perfect scorers have seat numbers in the same sequence and come from a particular exam centre in Bahad­urgarh, Haryana. Incidentally, the centre, run by the wife of the local BJP youth wing chief, was plagued by issues on test day itself, including a mix-up with question papers that led to delays. On social media, parents began sharing scorecards of students with 718 and 719 marks, an implausible total given that a correct answer is worth four marks and every wrong one docks a mark from your score. The results raised suspicions of awarding of grace marks—which 1,563 students managed (including those at the Bahadurgarh centre). Though it is still not clear how many marks were awarded, they now stand cancelled. The affected students can opt for a re-test on June 23, although experts believe the re-test is hardly likely to affect the final rankings. The current fracas has rekindled memories of the first all-India NEET exam in 2016, where students were allowed to give a re-examination. Dr Raghav Kumar from Delhi, who completed his MBBS in 2021 from the University College of Medical Sciences in the capital, was one such aspirant that year. He says, “I opted to stick with my score in the first NEET exam instead of taking the retest. But I still remember the toll it took on my mental health...it was a gamble with my future.” Kumar adds that his score of 562 (rank 1,048 in 2016) wouldn’t even have got him a rank of 100,000 this year. Several petitions have been submitted to the high courts and the Supreme Court citing the arbitrary grace marks, the peculiar jump in the number of high scorers and even the possibility of paper leaks. As Alakh Pandey, peti­tioner and CEO of PhysicsWallah, asks, “The question is, what if there are other discrepancies we are unaware of?” On June 11, Pandey had moved the SC against the arbitrary award of grace marks, saying the NTA’s explanation does not hold. The petition had the signatures of 20,000 students and included evidence that 70-80 marks had been randomly awarded to some candida­tes. In parallel, the possibility of a paper leak began gathering force. THE PAPER LEAK TRAIL Many began questioning why students from Haryana, Bihar, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Karnataka appeared for NEET at an obscure centre in Gujarat’s Godhra. Blowing the lid off a multi-crore cheating scam, the Gujarat police have now unearthed details of how at least 26 students from across the country paid Rs 10 lakh to Rs 66 lakh each to clear the NEET exam. The scam ran at three ends—one allegation involved a Vadodara-based coaching class Roy Overseas run by Parshuram Roy; the principal of Jay Jalaram school in Godhra (the exam centre), Purshottam Sharma; and a teacher at the school and designated deputy superintendent for the centre, Tushar Bhatt. The students accused of cheating were to fill in the answers they knew; the teachers would fill in the blanks after the answer key was released. But here too, after the initial investigations and an FIR being filed on May 9, no further revelations were made in the case till the Supreme Court clubbed an appeal seeking a CBI inquiry into the Godhra paper leak case with other NEET-related petitions from across the country. That’s when five of the accused were arrested on June 13. A similar racket has come to light in Patna, Bihar. A search of junior engineer Sikandar Yadav’s vehicle on May 5 in the city yielded copies of four NEET admit cards and other documents. The 56-year-old employee of the Danapur Nagar Parishad confessed he had received the NEET questions before the exam and named four accomplices—Sanjeev Singh, Rocky, Nitish and Amit Anand. Based on their confessions, investigators discovered that the gang members had rented rooms in a boys’ hostel and a school in Patna, where some 40 students memorised the answers a day before the NEET exam. The police raided the location and recovered burnt question papers, along with admit cards, post-dated cheques worth Rs 2.3 crore and educational certificates of the students which the gang had confiscated as surety. Sources say each candidate was asked to pay Rs 30-50 lakh. The gang took advance payments of Rs 1 lakh from the students. Upon receiving the paper, the students were taken to a safe house at night to memorise the answers. So far, the police have arrested 13 people, including four candidates who took the NEET test. Thirty-five other students have been called in for questioning. THE PROBE AND OTHER DISCREPANCIES The NTA had constituted a panel of three experts to look into the cases reported, including impersonation, cheating and tampering with the OMR (optical mark recognition) sheet, says director-general Subodh Kumar Singh. The inquiry apparently found that 63 students used unfair means and they have since been debarred or their scores withheld. However, the DG also told agencies that “the sanctity of the medical entrance exam has not been compromised...there has been no paper leak”. The petitioners, though, are unconvinced and say they want a CBI investigation. “How do we know there aren’t more cases like Godhra and Patna?” asks Rohit Advani (name changed), a 17-year-old from Mumbai who went through the Kota grind and appeared for NEET this year (his rank was above 150,000). There have been other peculiarities this year. For example, the original last date of registration for NEET was March 9, but was extended till 16th. Then, for the first time, a two-day window (April 9-10) was opened for more candidates to register (around 24,000 did so). There has been no explanation for why three rounds of registration were carried out. The decision to announce the results on June 4, 10 days ahead of the original date and on the day of the election results, also raised a few eyebrows. “We’ll do everything to ensure that the sanctity of the institution is maintained,” says NTA chairman Prof. Pradeep Kumar Joshi, who is also heading the four-member panel constituted by the Union government to probe the irregularities. “The matter is in court and we are ready to face any inquiry.” The fact that the investigation will be led by the very person who heads the NTA has also come in for flak. Members of the agency and the petitioners declined to comment, saying the matter is sub judice. A shroud of mystery also surrounds those who set the papers for NEET. There are allegations of a connection between the exam setters and the coaching centres. “Entrance exam coaching in India is a multi-million dollar industry. The more toppers a centre produces, the higher the fees it can charge new students, so there is intense competition. With the new rules that centres cannot have students below 16, the pressure this year has been greater. There is certainly interaction between members of the NTA and us...many of its members are also heads of other universities. The opportunity and motive for manipulation is there, but whether it happened or not is difficult to prove,” says a source at a top coaching academy in Delhi-NCR. WHAT IS THE WAY OUT? Dharmendra Pradhan, the Union minister for education, has already talked about reforming the NTA. The Justice A.K. Rajan Committee, constituted by Tamil Nadu in 2021, had given some drastic suggestions. One recommendation was that the state use legal provisions to scrap NEET for medical entrance exams. Instead, it wants the higher secondary exam scores to become the sole admission criteria. Many experts say India can learn from other countries like the US, which has standardised tests—SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) and ACT (American College Test)—for college-bound stude­nts. Some 2 million students take these every year. “The US model is suitable for India as it offers flexibility and reduces the stress with multiple test dates throughout the year,” says Prof. Ramgopal Rao, vice-chancellor of BITS Pilani. He adds that the NTA’s transparency issues can be resolved if it is given constitutional status like the UPSC (Union Public Service Commission). Other experts point to strengthening our medical education infrastructure so that exams aren’t so competitive in the first place. There are currently 706 medical colleges in India, 386 of them government, offering 109,170 seats for MBBS, 15 per cent of the seats in government medical colleges are reserved for the All-India Quota, the rest for the home states. One suggestion is to increase the number of seats by converting district hospitals into medical colleges using the PPP model. Medical education can also be made more affordable, particularly in private colleges, to ease the competition for government college seats. The National Medical Commission (NMC) Act has the provision to regulate fees and all other charges in 50 per cent of the seats in private medical colleges and deemed universities and is framing guidelines in this regard. “Let us be honest, this country needs more doctors,” says a professor of medicine at AIIMS Delhi, who did not wish to be named. “Most of us are massively overworked, seeing 30-35 patients a day, which is not good at all. We need to figure out a system to produce more doctors, and quality ones at that. We have seen a huge drop in the quality of students coming to study medicine. Most of them have just tired themselves out memorising useless things and either drop out within a year or perform poorly.” Last year, medical malpractice suits in India hit the 5.2 million cases mark with incidents rising by 110 per cent and litigation by 400 per cent. Experts say this also raises doubts on whether NEET is bringing the best minds to medicine. Regarding malpractices, many say the exam should be shifted to online mode. “NEET should be conducted online. This will solve so many issues. The exam should also be conducted in two stages, like JEE and JEE Mains, so that students have the option to retake the test in six months and not wait a whole year,” says Anil Nagar, founder of vernacular test prep platform, Adda247. Others question the very quality of NEET, asserting that it has gone down over the years, becoming highly repetitive. Rao says entrance exams should have a large question bank with varying difficulty levels, randomly picked by an algorithm for each candidate. “This, along with real-time adaptation and immediate provision of raw scores after the test, could effectively address the challenges of scaling up exams,” he says. Students also say that there is too much emphasis on rote learning. “I understand that Biology needs to be mugged up, but that shouldn’t be the case with Physics and Chemistry. There should be application-based questions, not just theoretical,” says Ankur Mukherjee, 19. Ankur got lucky in his second NEET attempt in 2023. With a score of 677 and an all-India rank of 1,847, he got into Vardhman Mahavir Medical College (VMMC) in the capital. When his first attempt in 2022 didn’t go as planned—he scored 583—he decided to retake the test and took a gap year. Ashutosh Mehta, 18, from Mumbai hasn’t been as lucky. He retook the exam this year and his rank has dropped by 60,000. “Last year, I could have got into a few public colleges, but they were not the best ones. This year, I can’t get through any,” he laments. He’s given up on his dreams and is joining his father’s export business. While minister Pradhan has promi­sed strong action against the NTA offi­cials if guilty, it is of little conso­lation for the students. The stress of preparing for the exam was bad enough, having it cancelled or forced to take a retest could be the end of the dream altogether. —With Shelly Anand, Jumana Shah, Amitabh Srivastava and Rahul Noronha Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Congress-led INDIA bloc made a strong comeback in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, even though it did not reach the majority mark. The alliance bagged 234 seats. However, it could have won at least nine more seats that it lost by a close margin and where a third party received a significant number of votes. These parties have likely cut the coalition’s vote share, pushing them to defeat. The Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi did not win any seats in Maharashtra, but in at least four seats, it got more votes than the victory margin of the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies. Votes received by VBA thus impacted the prospects of the Congress and its allies in Akola, Buldhana, Hatkanangle, and Mumbai North-West. In Mumbai North-West, the difference between the winner Shiv Sena and the runner-up Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) was only 48 votes. While the election was very close, The VBA flicked a little over 10,000 votes, which could have helped the INDIA bloc otherwise. In Hatkanangle, the Uddhav Sena lost by 13,426 votes while the VBA bagged 32,696. In Akola, the Congress lost to the BJP by 40,626 votes, while the VBA alone took away 2.77 lakh votes. Notably, Congress and its allies in Maharashtra held several rounds of negotiations with Ambedkar, but he had held firm on his demand for six seats. The INDIA bloc’s prospects in three other seats — Jaipur Rural in Rajasthan, Kanker in Chhattisgarh, and Morena in Madhya Pradesh — were hacked by the Bahujan Samaj Party. The Congress lost to the BJP in all three seats. In Jaipur Rural, the victory margin was only 1,615 votes but the BSP bagged 3,850 votes. In Kanker, the victory margin was 1,884 votes, while the BSP got 11,770 votes. The best chance the INDIA bloc had was in Morena, where the victory margin was 52,530 and the BSP got 1.8 lakh votes. The remaining two seats were Karimganj in Assam, and Kurukshetra in Haryana. The All India United Democratic Front dented Congress’ chances of winning the Karimganj seat. Congress lost to the BJP in Karimganj by 18,360 votes, while the AIUDF received 29,205 votes. In Kurukshetra, the Indian National Lok Dal candidate was a spoiler for Aam Aadmi Party candidate Dr Sushil Gupta, who lost the election to BJP candidate Naveen Jindal. The margin of victory was only 29,021 while the INLD candidate received 78,708 votes."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The recently-concluded elections defied most exit polls as the NDA alliance won only 293 seats against the projected 330+. One of the reasons for this jolt has been the switch in farmers’ support from the ruling alliance to its Opposition, the INDIA Bloc. The Axis My India post-poll survey offers an in-depth analysis of voter inclinations during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. This survey delves into the voting behavior among farmers and farm laborers, examining the fluctuations in support for major political parties and their allies over the course of two significant electoral cycles. According to the survey, in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, farmers favoured the Bharatiya Janata Party. Back then, 39 out of every 100 voters chose the party while only 19 out of 100 voters opted for the Indian National Congress. However, in the 2024 Lok Sabha election, the BJP's support decreased slightly to 37 out of 100 voters among farmers, while the Congress experienced a marginal increase to 21 votes. The Congress’ major support base came from its allies which saw a surge in farmers’ vote share increase from only 10 per cent in 2019 to an impressive 21 per cent in this election. Overall, while the NDA alliance had a lead of 45 per cent in farmers vote share in 2024, it was a drop of 3 per cent compared to 2019. On the other hand, the INDIA bloc witnessed a massive gain of 13 per cent over the previous election to 42 per cent in 2024. INDIA BLOC GAINS AT THE EXPENSE OF REGIONAL PARTIES Similarly, among farm labourers, the BJP secured 32 per cent vote share in 2019 and its allies got 7 per cent. The Congress got 19 per cent and its allies secured 7 per cent.Forward to the recent 2024 Lok Sabha election, the BJP maintained its lead with 31 per cent vote share among farm laborers and its allies too saw a jump to 11 per cent. However, the Congress and its allies saw a more impressive rise to 24 per cent and 17 per cent vote share. The biggest loss in both categories was to other parties, which include major regional parties in the states. These are BSP in Uttar Pradesh, YSRCP in Andhra Pradesh, AIADMK and DMDK in Tamil Nadu, SAD in Punjab, and the BJD in Odisha. In 2019, while 23 out of 100 farmers had voted for such parties, the number fell to just 13 in 2024. A bigger decline was seen in the vote share of farm labourers. The vote share of this category for regional parties had been 35 per cent in the previous election but fell by a drastic 18 percentage point to only 17 per cent. This means the farm labourers support base for regional parties was just half now compared to 2019."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The 2024 Lok Sabha elections have shaken up India's political landscape with dramatic seat flips. The biggest surprise was the retention of 35 seats by the Indian National Congress. On the other side, the Bharatiya Janata Party retained 207 seats. Strikingly, the Congress won 42 seats which the BJP held in 2019, and the BJP gained seven seats previously held by the grand old party. Here are the break-ups of the flow of seats between parties from 2019 to the 2024 elections, highlighting key changes and trends. BJP: Retained 207 seats, lost 96 seats. INC: Retained 35 seats, lost 17 seats. DMK: Retained 19 seats, lost 5 seats. TMC: Retained 20 seats, lost 2 seats. The popular mandate is clear: voters want a coalition government and a strong opposition. For the first time in a decade, the BJP has had to rely on support from its regional allies to form a government, a significant shift from its previous majority control in Parliament. The BJP won 240 seats, falling short of the 272 needed for a majority. Its National Democratic secured 293 seats in the 543-member Parliament. The INDIA bloc, led by a resurgent Congress party, made significant gains, nearly doubling its previous count to win 232 seats. The BJP retained a significant number of seats, showing its continued hold in many regions. However, the party also faced notable losses, indicating areas where its influence has waned. The BJP lost 42 seats to the Congress, 25 seats to the Samajwadi Party, and eight seats to the Trinamool Congress. Despite these losses, the BJP retained 207 seats, primarily in key states like Uttar Pradesh (33 seats), Madhya Pradesh (28 seats), and Gujarat (24 seats). However, it lost 96 seats it previously held, with notable losses in Uttar Pradesh (29 seats), Maharashtra (17 seats), and Rajasthan (10 seats). The BJP's strategy to expand its footprint succeeded, winning 33 new seats. It made significant gains in Odisha (12 seats), all from the Biju Janata Dal, Telangana (four seats), and Andhra Pradesh (three seats) from the YSR Congress Party. These wins indicate the party's growing influence in traditionally less supportive regions. However, the BJP suffered unexpected heavy losses in the Hindi heartland states, previously considered BJP bastions, including Uttar Pradesh. In this region, home to 240 million people, many lower-caste voters turned against the party. The Congress party managed to gain several seats from the BJP, signalling a partial recovery in regions where it previously lost ground. Despite these gains, the party lost seats to emerging parties, reflecting a dynamic and competitive political environment. The Congress retained 35 seats, maintaining a foothold in Kerala (13 seats), Tamil Nadu (6 seats), and Punjab (five seats). However, it lost 17 seats, including critical ones in Punjab (three seats) and Kerala (two seats). And the party won 64 new seats, a notable achievement. These new seats spanned Maharashtra (12 seats), Karnataka (nine seats), and Rajasthan (eight seats), signalling a potential shift in voter sentiment. Gains in Telangana (six seats) and Haryana (five seats) further highlighted their strategic victories. This result boosts the Congress party, which was widely seen as a waning political force after losing seats in India’s previous two general elections. Regional parties have made significant inroads in the 2024 elections, gaining seats from the BJP and the Congress. TMC: The party gained eight seats from the BJP in West Bengal and strengthened its position by retaining many existing seats. NCP-SP: The Maharashtra-based Nationalist Congress Party (Sharad Pawar) gained six seats from the BJP. RJD: In Bihar, the Rashtriya Janata Dal gained three seats from the BJP, reflecting a notable shift in voter preference. These trends show the growing influence of regional players — a more competitive political arena, with strong alliances and regional shifts significantly impacting the outcomes. While the BJP’s stronghold states remain crucial, Congress’ ability to regain ground suggests a vibrant democracy where political fortunes can shift with each election cycle. As the dust settles, the 2024 Lok Sabha elections stand as a testament to the ever-changing currents of Indian politics, with both major parties recalibrating and strategising for the future."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story India has elected a rather rich 18th Lok Sabha. Of the 543 representatives elected, an astonishing 504 are crorepatis (billionaires) according to the data released by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR). For context, one out of every three candidates contesting the 2024 polls were crorepatis ; and of the winners, this number was a little more than nine out of ten. In the 2009 polls, 58 per cent of the elected representatives were crorepatis ; in 2014, the number shot up to 82 per cent. It was 88 per cent in 2019, and 93 per cent this time. According to ADR’s analysis, the chance of a crorepati candidate winning was 19.6 per cent, compared to a 0.7 per cent chance for non- crorepati aspirants. Assets of newly-elected Members of Parliaments (MPs). Of the 240 Bharatiya Janata Party winners, 95 per cent were crorepatis. For the Congress, which won 99 seats, 92 winners were crorepatis. All 16 Telugu Desam Party victors and 12 Janata Dal (United) winners were crorepatis . For other prominent parties that won 20 or more seats, the number of crorepatis was over 90 per cent. The net worth of Members of Parliament has only risen from election to election — their average assets increased by more than seven times in the last 15 years, from Rs 5.35 crore in 2009 to Rs 46.34 crore in 2024. The average asset of a TDP Lok Sabha winner in 2024 was Rs 442 crore. BJP MPs, on an average, were worth Rs 50 crore, and Congress MPs, Rs 23 crore. More money power than ever. Of the 240 BJP Lok Sabha winners, 34 (14 per cent) had assets worth Rs 50 crore and above, 63 (26 per cent) declared assets between Rs 10 crore and Rs 50 crore, 130 (54 per cent) have assets worth between Rs 1 crore and Rs 10 crore, and 13 (5 per cent) have assets worth less than Rs 1 crore. Of the 99 winners from the Grand Old Party, 12 had assets worth Rs 50 crore and above, 34 declared assets worth between Rs 10 crore and Rs 50 crore, 46 had assets worth between Rs 1 crore and Rs 10 crore, and seven were worth less than Rs 1 crore. Of the 214 re-elected winners, 29 per cent doubled their assets since the last elections. The assets of Indra Hang Subba, a re-elected MP from the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha, increased by 3001 per cent since 2019. The assets of BJP’s Tejasvi Surya also increased almost 30-fold. The richest candidate makes the cut. Breaking the jinx of the richest candidates not winning the 2014 and 2019 elections, Dr Chandra Sekhar Pemmasani of the TDP, the richest candidate of 2024, worth Rs 5,705 crore, emerged victorious."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A water crisis in Delhi escalated to a legal battle after Haryana refused to release surplus water to the national capital. However, it is not just Delhi that is bearing the brunt of water stress as heat waves in different parts of India have increased power and water consumption. Households are struggling with the scarcity of freshwater as water tables lower. While climate change is one of the major reasons behind the shortage of water, overutilisation and wastage have added to the menace. Reports suggest that the average Indian wastes 30 per cent of their daily water requirement. To put into context, a faucet leaking even 10 drips per minute wastes 3.6 litres of water per day, according to the United States Geological Survey . Also, every flush of the toilet uses nearly six litres of water. “Another estimate of water wastage suggests that every day 4,84,20,000 crore cubic meters i.e. 48.42 billion one litre bottles of water is wasted, while in this country about 160 million people do not get clean and fresh water,” a Down to Earth magazine report noted. India is home to nearly 18 per cent of the global population but has only four per cent of the global water resources. India’s per capita water availability, per the World Bank , is around 1,100 cubic metres, “well below the internationally recognised threshold of water stress of 1,700 m3 per person, and dangerously close to the threshold for water scarcity of 1,000 m3 per person.” In comparison, the global per capita availability of water is 5,500 cubic metres. Population growth and economic development have together put pressure on water resources. Half a century ago, in 1970, per capita water availability in India was 2.5 times more than the current level. Per capita freshwater availability was 2,594 m3 in 1970. This steadily dwindled to 1,661 m3 in 1990 and 1,036 m3 in 2020, according to the World Bank. Northern and north-western India is more stressed than other regions. In 2020, Punjab extracted 164.4 per cent, well above the limit. Rajasthan extracted 150.2 per cent of freshwater from the ground, Haryana extracted 134.6 per cent, and Delhi extracted 101.4 per cent of its annual groundwater in 2020, according to the Ministry of Jal Shakti . The steady scarcity of freshwater is more of an Indian story than a global one. Of 197 countries, India ranks 141 for per capita freshwater availability. Iceland has the highest per capita freshwater availability of 4.6 lakh m3, Canada 74,986 m3, and Russia 29,929 m3. Meanwhile, India remains one of the largest water users per unit of GDP despite looming water scarcity."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The June 4 Lok Sabha verdict changed many widely-held perceptions about elections in India. But what didn’t change was the trend of electing candidates with tainted records. In fact, this has only grown. The number of candidates with criminal cases increased by 55 per cent since 2009. As per the Association for Democratic Reforms representatives, 251 (46 per cent) MPs in the 18th Lok Sabha have criminal cases registered against them. For context, that’s only 21 shy of a simple majority in the Lower House. Among them, 31 per cent have serious criminal cases that include cases related to rape, murder, attempt to murder, kidnapping and crimes against women. Twenty-seven MPs declared they were convicted and four declared they were charged with murder. Fifteen MPs were also charged with crimes against women, of which two were accused of rape. Candidates with a criminal history had a 15.3 per cent higher chance of winning compared to 4.4 per cent for those with a clean record, the ADR noted. Of the 240 BJP MPs in 2024, 39 per cent had criminal cases against them, with 26 per cent facing serious criminal charges. Forty-nine of the Congress's 99 MPs had criminal cases against them (32 per cent face serious criminal charges). More than half of the DMK’s 22 MPs had criminal cases against them, and of the Samajwadi Party’s (SP) 37 winners, 57 per cent had criminal cases. The candidates of all four RJD MPs also had serious criminal cases. Of the 20 elected representatives from Kerala for the Lok Sabha in 2024, 19 had criminal cases against them and 55 per cent had serious criminal cases against them. Telangana, which has 17 seats, elected 81 per cent of candidates with criminal cases, and 71 per cent of the candidates had serious cases against them. In the five states with the most Lok Sabha seats — Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Bihar, and Tamil Nadu — over 50 per cent of the representatives had criminal records. Half of Uttar Pradesh's 80 representatives had criminal cases. In Maharashtra, 24 of 48 seats are represented by candidates with criminal cases. In West Bengal, 52 per cent of MPs had criminal backgrounds and in Bihar, this was 53 per cent. Dean Kuriakose, the Congress representative from Idukki in Kerala, had the most criminal cases — 88, of which 23 were serious Indian Penal Code (IPC) cases against him. He was convicted in 18 cases. Of the ministers in the Modi 3.0 ministry, 39 per cent had criminal cases against them. Two of these ministers, Shantanu Thakur and Sukanta Majumdar, face charges under Section 307 of the IPC for attempted murder. Bandi Sanjay Kumar, a Minister of State for Home Affairs, had 42 criminal cases, making him the minister with the most criminal cases against him."

For context, in 2023, the highest June temperature was 41.8°C. It was 44.2°C in 2022 and 43°C in 2021. Even in 2019, which was quite hot, the highest June temperature was 45.6°C. According to the Indian Meteorological Department, on June 1, the maximum temperature was 43.9°C in Delhi Safdarjung, while the normal maximum for that date was 39.9°C. This trend continued with the maximum temperature consistently staying above normal levels. By June 13, the temperature reached 45.4°C, significantly higher than the normal of 39.9°C. Minimum temperatures in June 2024 have also been notably higher than normal. Typically, the minimum temperatures for this time of year hover around 28°C. However, this June, the minimums frequently exceeded this average. On June 16, the minimum temperature reached a peak of 32.2°C, well above the normal minimum. This consistent rise in nighttime temperatures is concerning. June 2024’s record-breaking heat is a clear indication that climate change is real and global warming is happening right now."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The central point of any election is usually the upliftment of the poor, from slogans of ‘Roti, Kapada aur Makaan’ to ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ . Politicians often woo the votes of the country’s poor with such catchphrases, but recent data reveals that there really has been a transformative shift over the past decade. Government statisticians suggest that India is nearing victory in its battle against extreme poverty. Economists Surjit Bhalla and Karan Bhasin, after analysing the 2022-23 consumer survey, concluded that India has nearly eradicated extreme poverty. Extreme Poverty: About a decade ago, 12 out of every 100 people in India lived on $1.90 PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) a day or less. Today, that number has dropped to just 2 out of 100. This means millions of people now have enough to meet their basic needs. Higher Poverty: Previously, 54 out of every 100 people lived on $3.20 a day or less. Now, only 17 out of 100 people face this level of poverty. This significant drop shows a broader improvement in living standards across the country. India has almost eliminated extreme poverty, with only 2.2 per cent of its population living below the World Bank's poverty line. This figure could be even lower if we account for the full value of subsidised food. “At the World Bank’s extreme poverty line of $1.90 per day, India appears to have nearly eradicated extreme poverty (with a national poverty rate of 2.2 per cent before adjusting for food and other subsidies),” noted economists Bhalla and Bhasin in their latest paper. What's New: The latest household consumption expenditure survey data from the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) is now available with micro-level details. These insights enable accurate estimates of poverty levels across different states, and in both rural and urban areas. Why It Matters: Without an official consumption survey for 2022-23, various studies have used alternative data to estimate poverty and inequality. Their confidence stems from a government factsheet released in February, summarising the first nationwide survey of household consumption in over a decade. Now this data is available at a micro level, offering detailed estimates based on different rural and urban poverty lines of $1.90 and $3.20 per day. The Poverty Headcount Ratio (HCR) is a measure that indicates the percentage of a population living below the poverty line. It reflects the proportion of people in a specific region or country whose income or consumption levels fall below an established poverty threshold, such as $1.90 or $3.20 per day based on PPP. The HCR provides a clear picture of the extent of poverty and is used to compare poverty levels across different regions and over time. In numbers: The study shows that at the $1.90 PPP poverty line, the percentage of people in poverty has significantly dropped from 12.2 per cent to 2.2 per cent over the past decade. This decline contradicts claims that poverty has increased or remained unchanged. The reduction in poverty is even more pronounced at the $3.20 PPP line, where it has fallen from 53.6 per cent to 16.4 per cent. The estimates, derived from an NSSO factsheet, highlight trends across various income groups. New data reveals that poverty is declining faster than previously believed. According to the study, extreme poverty has dropped to 2 per cent nationally. However, at the slightly higher poverty line of $3.20 per day (adjusted for purchasing power parity, PPP), the rate remains at 20.8 per cent, up from the earlier estimate of 16.4 per cent. In India, the official consumption-based poverty line is still the Tendulkar Line, which is close to the World Bank's $1.90 a day line. The Tendulkar expert group, chaired by economist Suresh Tendulkar in 2009, was formed to review the methodology for poverty estimation. The latest data suggests another distinctive feature of the states' progress: A decline in inequality over the previous 11 years. Our analysis of rural and urban poverty reveals stark differences across India. States like Goa, Punjab, and Himachal Pradesh report very low poverty rates. In contrast, Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh face higher levels of poverty. Bihar's poverty rate, measured at $3.20 per day (Purchasing Power Parity), dropped significantly from 69.6 per cent in 2011-12 to 23.3 per cent in 2022-23. Kerala also saw a notable reduction, with its rate falling from 30.3 per cent to 16.0 per cent over the same period. In the past decade, India has made remarkable progress in reducing extreme poverty, as measured by the $1.90 PPP poverty line. Numerous states have achieved substantial declines in their poverty headcount ratios. For example, Andhra Pradesh's extreme poverty rate fell from 4.9 per cent to 1.0 per cent, and Assam's rate dropped from 20.7 per cent to 3.2 per cent. Bihar saw a significant reduction from 15.1 per cent to 2.7 per cent. Despite these successes, challenges persist in states like Chhattisgarh, where the rate, although reduced, remains at 15.0 per cent. From 2011-12 to 2022-23, India saw a significant reduction in poverty across both rural and urban areas. In 2011-12, the average monthly spending per person was Rs 1,803. At the $1.90 PPP poverty line, about 13 out of every 100 people in rural areas and around 11 out of 100 in urban areas were living in extreme poverty. For the $3.20 PPP poverty line, 60 out of 100 in rural areas and 40 out of 100 in urban areas were considered poor. By 2022-23, average monthly spending increased to Rs 4,737. Extreme poverty at the $1.90 PPP level dropped to just about 2 out of every 100 people in both rural and urban areas, while poverty at the $3.20 PPP level decreased to around 20 out of 100 in rural areas and about 12 out of 100 in urban areas. This progress shows a major improvement in living standards over the decade. India's current official poverty line does not match its status as a lower-middle-income country. The World Bank's $3.20 PPP poverty line is designed for such countries and is suitable for measuring poverty, especially for international comparisons. There has been a significant reduction in poverty even at this $3.20 PPP level. Experts suggest that this line can be considered an appropriate measure of extreme poverty for India while also using a higher poverty line for a more comprehensive measure. Choosing a new poverty line has important implications for policy decisions, especially those related to redistribution and social safety nets. Big Picture: A 2 per cent poverty rate is less surprising when considering a change in India's survey methodology. Previously, survey teams asked people to report their consumption of hundreds of items over a uniform 30-day recall period. In 2011-12, they adopted a \"mixed\" approach: using shorter recall periods for perishables and longer ones for consumer durables. This method captures more accurate household consumption data, leading to significantly lower poverty estimates. The World Bank (2018) noted that while longer recall periods capture infrequent purchases, they risk underreporting. Short recall periods reduce this but can cause telescoping errors. \"Global poverty count produced by the World Bank will soon no longer be based on the URP for India, and a switch to the MMRP will occur,\" the World Bank stated. One of the main reasons for the vast difference in poverty estimates is the difference in the methodology of each paper. There are no official poverty figures in India between 2013 and 2023. However, researchers estimated half a dozen different estimates of poverty in India in this period. These estimates suggest that the percentage of people living in poverty varies from 2.5 per cent to 29.5 per cent of the population, depending on the source and the time between 2013 and 2023. While Bhalla and Bhasin's findings offer an encouraging narrative about poverty reduction in India, it is essential to critically evaluate their claims in the broader context of ongoing socio-economic challenges. Expert Srijit Mishra of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research suggests in his latest paper that the updated poverty estimates indicate a lower poverty incidence compared to previous rounds, but this could be due to the non-comparability of data and the design of the 2022-23 survey. There is a need to rethink social welfare measures linked to poverty lines, advocating for a more comprehensive approach to address the basic needs of the population. The persistence of government food programs, the contradiction between low poverty rates and high malnutrition, and the methodological concerns raised by other researchers suggest that the reality is more nuanced."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In the first quarter of FY2024-25, Delhi recorded an all-time high power demand of 8,656 MW on June 19. This figure, reported by the State Load Despatch Center, Delhi, was more than 16 per cent higher than the maximum power demand in the previous financial year. This significant increase reflects the steadily growing energy needs of the national capital, continuing a trend observed over the past two decades. From a peak demand of 3,639 MW in 2006-07, Delhi's power consumption — rising annually, except in 2015-16 and 2020-21 — has more than doubled this year. It also comes as no surprise that the summer months are seeing this extraordinary power surge. This year is seeing an unusually hot June , which set a new record for the highest temperature recorded in the month in a decade: a scorching 47°C. For context, in 2023, the highest June temperature was 41.8°C. It was 44.2°C in 2022 and 43°C in 2021. June 2024 surpassed other years in the last half-decade in power demand. On June 1, the demand skyrocketed to 7,926 MW, compared to 4,390 MW on the same day in 2023, and 6,235 MW in 2022. This trend continued throughout the month, with the demand consistently surpassing previous years’ records. In the first 19 days of June 2024, Delhi's power demand crossed the 8,000 MW mark four times — a phenomenon that hasn’t been observed in the past. On June 3, the demand reached 7,915 MW, a significant increase from 4,720 MW in 2023, and 6,611 MW in 2022. Similarly, on June 5, the demand was 7,998 MW, compared to 5,523 MW in 2023 and 6,704 MW in 2022. The pattern of high demand persisted, with peaks such as 8,220 MW on June 14, significantly higher than 7,226 MW recorded on the same day in 2023 and 7,144 MW in 2022. This continuous increase underscores the mounting pressure on Delhi's power infrastructure."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Union Cabinet has announced Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for 14 kharif crops for marketing season 2024-25. Farmers, the government said, will get around Rs 2 lakh crore as MSP, Rs 35,000 crore more than the previous season. Ragi will receive an MSP of Rs 4,290 per quintal, the highest price rise (11.5 per cent) in the cereal category, compared to the 2023-2024 kharif marketing season. In the pulses category with Rs 7,550 per quintal for the current marketing season, tur has seen an MSP rise of 7.9 per cent. Nigerseed MSP rose by 12.7 per cent at Rs 8,717. In other pulses, the hybrid variety of jowar will receive an MSP of Rs 3,371, a rise of Rs 191. Bajra will receive an MSP of Rs 2,625, an increase of Rs 125. An MSP of Rs 2,225 has been set for maize; in the last marketing season, it was Rs 2,090. Paddy will receive an MSP of Rs 2,300 which is Rs 117 higher. In pulses, moong and urad saw an MSP rise of Rs 124 and 450 respectively. The former is now priced at Rs 8,682 and the latter at Rs 7,400. Groundnut, sunflower seed, and yellow soybean will receive MSPs of Rs 6,783, Rs 7,280, and Rs 4,882 per quintal, an increase of Rs 406, Rs 520, and Rs 292 from the previous year. Sesum will receive an MSP of Rs 9,267, a change of Rs 632 from the previous kharif marketing season. In the commercial category, cotton’s medium staple variety attracted a hike of 7.6 per cent. The long stapler variety of the same crop received a hike of 7.1 per cent and will be priced at Rs 7,121 and Rs 7,521. Keeping with the Union Budget 2018-19, MSP has been set at a minimum of 1.5 times the all-India weighted average cost of production. The margin between the cost of production and the MSP is highest for bajra at 77 per cent, followed by tur at 59 per cent, and maize at 54 per cent. Urad has a margin of 52 per cent between the cost of production and the MSP. The remaining ten kharif crops have a margin of 50 per cent. Rice extracted from paddy is a significant crop in India. It has seen a 26.7 per cent rise in MSP from 2019-2020 to 2024-2025. The highest change it received was in the 2023-2024 season at seven per cent and the lowest change it received was 2.9 per cent in the 2020-2021 kharif marketing season. The government procures at a higher rate wheat and paddy for the public distribution system and the demand for other crops is lower from the government."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story India is set to face Australia after two comfortable victories against Afghanistan and Bangladesh in the T20 World Cup. The last time India and Australia met in an ICC tournament, it turned out to be the anti-climactic end to India’s World Cup dream in the finals of the 2023 Cricket World Cup.

While batting second in two matches, India emerged victorious in one. The top order does most of the heavy lifting for the Aussies against India in the T-20 World Cup, showing dependency to win the matches.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story England's Harry Brook has set his sights on delivering a decisive victory against the United States, aiming to secure England's place in the semi-finals of the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup 2024. Brook, who fell just short of clinching a win in a nail-biting encounter against South Africa, expressed his determination to ensure England dominates their next match. Brook's valiant effort of 53 runs in the final over wasn't enough to secure victory in the tightly contested match against South Africa, which ended in a seven-run defeat. As England transitioned from St Lucia to Barbados for their third game in just five days, Brook emphasized the importance of winning to stay in contention for the knockout stages. \"We've got to win and that's the main thing,\" Brook stated. \"Let's see how we are on net run-rate after that, but the main thing is to definitely get that win. We've played in Barbados quite a lot in the last six months or so. We know the conditions, we know the wind and the pitch as well, so hopefully we can go out there and give them a good battering.\" England's familiarity with the conditions in Barbados could prove advantageous, as Brook and his teammates look to exploit their knowledge of the pitch and weather patterns to their benefit. Brook's determination reflects the team's overall focus on not just winning, but doing so convincingly to improve their net run-rate, a crucial factor in progressing to the semi-finals. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats Reflecting on the team's recent experiences, Brook shared a glimpse into the squad's mindset. \"I watched (Australia v Scotland) in a bar in Antigua but we were all knackered. I watched the first half then went to bed and watched the second half,\" he recounted. \"But yes, absolutely we will keep a close eye on that final game in the group. It's awesome to be involved in a World Cup, a dream come"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story India finally cracked the batting code in the T20 World Cup in their Super 8 innings against Bangladesh on Saturday 22 June. India smashed 196 - the highest-ever total at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua. The innings had only one half-centurian - Hardik Pandya, who attained his milestone in the final ball of the innings. There were no anchors in the Indian innings, among the top three batters, something that has not been seen in the last two World Cups at all. India captain Rohit Sharma, senior batter Virat Kohli and then Rishabh Pant at No. 3 just tried to maximise their scoring options, hitting the Bangladesh bowlers out of the ground in their Super 8 game. The dismissals were similar too - Rohit and Kohli got out trying to hit a six. Rishabh handed a catch trying to reverse sweep the ball. While many on social media criticised the Indian batters for not playing with caution, Rohit Sharma remained unmoved. T20 World Cup 2024, Super 8: IND vs BAN Highlights | Full Scorecard Speaking at the post-match presentation ceremony, Rohit hailed the Indian batters for their intent and the ability to shun the idea of a milestone. Sharma, who had first spoken about the need for renewed intent before the T20 World Cup 2022, walked the talk with 23 off 11 balls, as the rest of the batters followed. Not a single Indian top-5 batter had a strike rate less than 130, on a slightly sticky pitch in Antigua. \"I have been talking about this for a long time now. It's about going there and putting that to work. Considering everything we played really well, and adapted to the conditions. There's a little bit of wind factor here, overall we are very smart, overall we were good with bat and ball,\" Sharma told the broadcaster after the match. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats The Indian captain categorically shunned the need to play a milestone innings. Why wouldn't he? India bat till 8 in this T20 World Cup. Rather than playing a long innings of 60-ball hundred, it is possibly better to utilise the skill sets of world-class batters who can hold their own against any opposition in the world. \"All eight batters need to play their role, whatever it is. We saw one guy get 50 and we got 196, in T20 I don't believe we need to get fifties and hundreds, what matters is the pressure you put on the bowlers. All the batters from the word go played like that and that's how we want to play as well,\" Rohit said. Rohit found support from two of the brightest brains in Indian cricket - R Ashwin and Wasim Jaffer. Both took to Twitter to express their joy in watching the Indian team bat, hailing the freshness of the approach. \"We are not used to an approach where batsmen throw it away after making 30’s 20’s, but it is about time we embrace an approach like this especially while batting first. Top Intent from all the Indian batters so far,\" R Ashwin said on Twitter. We are not used to an approach where batsmen throw it away after making 30’s 20’s, but it is about time we embrace an approach like this especially while batting first. ?????? Top Intent from all the Indian batters so far???? #INDvBAN #T20WorldCup — Ashwin ???? (@ashwinravi99) June 22, 2024 \"Refreshing to see the intent from the Indian batters today. Every batter in top 6 hit at least a six and ensured there was no drop in run rate even after wkts fell. Top inns and finish from Hardik Pandya,\" reckoned Wasim Jaffer. Refreshing to see the intent from the Indian batters today. Every batter in top 6 hit at least a six and ensured there was no drop in run rate even after wkts fell. Top inns and finish from @hardikpandya7 ???? #INDvBAN #T20WC — Wasim Jaffer (@WasimJaffer14) June 22, 2024 This is possibly the biggest development in India batting unit since Rohit Sharma's takeover of captaincy. Keep in mind that the Indian team tried to go against their grain in Asia Cup 2022 and T20 World Cup 2022 as well, but it did not come off. We will never know for sure whether it was because of the team not buying into the philosophy or the Indian batters simply did not have the ability at the time. But that now has changed. India have made braver selections by bringing Yashasvi Jaiswal instead of Shubman Gill, Sanju Samson instead KL Rahul. Rohit and Rahul Dravid have managed to hammer the 'aggressive approach' into the team's DNA, which has finally come off against the poor Bangladesh, who were just blown out of the water on Saturday. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli came out with aggressive intent after Bangladesh sent India to bat first in what looked like a great wicket. India continued their aggressive approach after the dismissal of their captain. Both Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant kept their foot on the pedal as India continued to tick away with runs despite the regular fall of wickets. Virat Kohli got out trying to hit a slower ball for six. Rishabh Pant was caught trying to reverse sweep spinner Rishad Hossain, but India were never below the 8 RPO mark in their batting innings. After the dismissal of those two batters, Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube were quiet for a bit and once agian attacked in the final five overs after soaking in the pressure. Dube had not done well for the majority of the innings, but hit 3 sixes in the last few balls of his innings to balloon up his score to 34 off 24 balls. The real hero however was Hardik Pandya, who played an intelligent innings of 50* off 27 balls. Pandya hit the ball with the wind and chose his options well to take India well over par score at the venue. It is no secret that India were hurt after their ODI World Cup 2023 loss against Australia. Rohit himself has come out and said that it felt like a bad dream, the 19th of November. However, the defeat did not put Rohit six feet under the ground, it only made him stronger. The Indian team looks like they are on a mission, every time they take the field in the T20 World Cup. And this new approach with the bat might be key to ending India's ICC title drought in the T20 World Cup 2024."

Yadav added that the places in the state where Lord Ram had gone will be identified and developed as religious sites under the 'Ram Van Gaman Path' and 'Krishna Path Gaman' projects. “This was also mentioned in our manifesto. I am happy that we are working on it. We will include Lord Ram and Lord Krishna in the curriculum of higher education and school education,\" the Chief Minister told reporters. State Congress President Jitendra Patwari, reacting to the decision, stated it is good to teach about Lord Ram and Lord Krishna, but he highlighted the allegations of paper leaks, corruption, and other discrepancies the government should address. \"The family has taught about Lord Ram, Lord Krishna, and love since childhood. Every father says to become a good person. Lord Ram has taught it. They include it in the book; may God give them wisdom. It is good, but the future of students is affected due to paper leaks. The responsibility lies with the government,” news agency ANI quoted the Congress leader. He added, “What are the reasons behind recruitment scams in the BJP government? Who will take responsibility for them? It is good to teach about Lord Ram and Lord Krishna in the book, but paper leaks, corruption, and scams are sins; the government should avoid them.\" Meanwhile, the Chief Priest of Ram Janmabhoomi Temple, Acharya Satyendra Das, called the Madhya Pradesh government’s decision a “good move” and urged that the entire country should follow their example. He noted that even if one does not consider them as gods, they are great men, and it is good to learn about them. “It is a very good thing. It should be followed in the entire country,” he said."

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will be representing India at the summit of the Eurasian political, economic, and security organisation. The Prime Minister had earlier reportedly confirmed that he will be travelling to Astana for the summit and some of the security measures were also initiated. However, according to reports, New Delhi has apprised the multilateral body about the change. Heads of governments of other member states -- China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Iran -- is likely to attend the meeting or send a representative. Last year, Prime Minister Modi virtually hosted the SCO summit and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and Russian President Vladimir Putin were also participated. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which was founded in 2001 by China and Russia and expanded over the years, is the world's largest regional organisation in terms of geographic area and population, covering a vast part of Eurasia. It acts as a platform for member states to address regional security concerns, fight terrorism, and promote economic development and also serves as a partner to the United Nations on issues related to peace and security."

Notably, Afghanistan beat Australia by 21 runs in Match 48 of the T20 World Cup 2024 to remain alive in the tournament and push Australia on the verge of elimination. Following their win, a Pakistan journalist made a bizarre claim that Afghanistan can beat any team in the world except India as they get good IPL contracts from the cricketing powerhouse. However, the comment didn’t go down well with Ashwin who requested Elon Musk to not allow such posts on his X timeline. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats “Afghanistan can beat any team in the world except India for obvious reasons. IPL contracts are very precious,” a Pakistani journalist had written on his X account. “I can’t tell u what to do @elonmusk but I should certainly have the right to decide who enters my house. My timeline my decisionð,” wrote Ashwin in reply. I can’t tell u what to do @elonmusk but I should certainly have the right to decide who enters my house. My timeline my decisionð https://t.co/WsR95ToHSk — Ashwin ð®ð³ (@ashwinravi99) June 23, 2024 Afghanistan beat Australia for the first time ever in international cricket in the sixth meeting in the white-ball formats between the two teams. After being put in to bat first, Afghanistan posted a good score of 148/6 in their allotted 20 overs. Openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz (60 off 49) and Ibrahim Zadran (51 off 48) got their team off to great start adding 118 runs for the first wicket off 95 balls. However, following their dismissals, Pat Cummins (3/28) took his second consecutive hat trick of the tournament dismissing Rashid Khan (2 off 5), Karim Janat (13 off 9) and Gulbadin Naib (0 off 1). Adam Zampa (2/28) also picked up two wickets as Australia restricted Afghanistan under 150. In the second innings, Australia’s chase got off to a disastrous start with Naveen ul Haq (3/20) dismissing Travis Head (0 off 3) and Mitchell Marsh (12 off 9). Mohamad Nabi got the big wicket of David Warner (3 off 8) to leave Australia on 32/3. Seeing his team in trouble, Glenn Maxwell once again looked like bailing Australia out of trouble scoring a magnificent half century (59 off 41). However, his dismissal in the 15th over by Gulbadin Naib (4/20) brought Afghanistan on the verge of a win as Australia were eventually bundled out for 127 in 19.2 overs. As a result, Afghanistan registered a historic win which put Australia in a precarious situation in their T20 World Cup campaign making their last game against India a potential knockout match for the 2021 champions. Earlier, Afghanistan also beat New Zealand by 84 runs in the group stage which also put them on the verge of elimination. The Kiwis were eventually knocked out after a 13-run loss vs West Indies."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story India are set to play their final Super 8 match in the T20 World Cup 2024 on Monday, 24 June. India have already won two matches in the Super 8 stage and will confirm their place in the semi-finals if they beat Australia in their next match. The match is expected to be played in good batting conditions, but there is no denying that the Caribbean pitches have started to exhibit their sluggish nature. India assistant coach Paras Mhambrey was asked at the pre-match press conference if India could play four spinners in their starting line-up in case the conditions support spin. Replying to the question, Mhambrey hoped that the surface would not be so biased towards spin that they have to play four spinners in the same line-up. India have played three spinners so far in the Caribbean leg of the tournament. Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja were in the Indian line-up from the very start. Kuldeep Yadav was included in the line-up from the Super 8 stages. \"It all depends on what surface - I hope the surface won't be that spinner friendly I think going in yes three spinners, I think just add the balance but I'm not very sure all the other venues - in case, I'm saying I don't look like the surface is going to be that dry and going to turn so much but yeah if the surface is like that, there's a lot of wear and tear in the wicket yeah for a spinner if you think that's the best option you want to go and enter the game, you might as well go with it,\" Mhambrey said at the pre-match press conference. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats The assistant coach lauded Kuldeep Yadav's bowling ability and explained why the bowler was not kept in the playing XI in the group stage of the tournament. Kuldeep Yadav has played just 2 matches in the T20 World Cup 2024 and has made himself undroppable with 5 wickets to his name. \"He's always been a class bowler, he's always done well for us, always won games for us initially as well. But unfortunately, because of the kind of wickets that we played in the US, he couldn't get an opportunity, couldn't get a run. But good to see that he's come out last two games, he's done well. This was fabulous. I think he really bowled well, used the conditions very well and yeah, good to see that he's got in the run,\" Mhambrey said. India have a chance to knock out Australia from the tournament. In case India win against Australia, the Mitchell Marsh team will have to depend on the result of Bangladesh vs Afghanistan. In case Afghanistan in that encounter, Australia will get knocked out of the tournament. Conversely, if Bangladesh win, it will come down to the NRR in the group."

You have no role if they want some convenience,\" the Delhi court said. Arvind Kejriwal is lodged in Tihar jail after being arrested in a money laundering case linked to the Delhi liquor policy case. The court sought Tihar Jail’s superintendent’s response to an application filed by Arvind Kejriwal seeking directions to allow his wife to be virtually present during the consultation of the medical board constituted for him post court’s orders. A day’s time has been granted by the vacation bench presided over by Judge Mukesh Kumar, to the superintendent concerned to reply to the application. During the hearing when the Enforcement Directorate’s counsel sought time to reply to Kejriwal’s application, the court remarked that ED has no role if Kejriwal, who’s the accused in the case, wants some convenience. \"Your reply is not required,\" the court added. The court posted Kejriwal’s bail pleas for hearing on June 19 and 22. The matter was adjourned after the Enforcement Directorate sought time to file a reply in the matter. \"Application has been moved by the accused seeking directions to allow his wife to join the medical board. Before passing any order, I deem it appropriate to call for a reply from the jail superintendent concerned. The application be kept for tomorrow,\" the judge said. \"I will consider his convenience, not yours (ED),\" the judge said while discussing what date his bail pleas should be listed. The court on June 5 dismissed Kejriwal's application seeking interim bail in the case on medical grounds. The judge, however, had directed the Tihar jail authorities to take care of Kejriwal's medical needs while in judicial custody. He had also extended Kejriwal's judicial custody till June 19."

A Division Bench of Justices Neena Bansal Krishna and Amit Sharma further directed social media platforms X, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube to take down similar content when it comes to their notice. The court further directed a host of other social media handles to take down the video as well. The court passed the order while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Vaibhav Singh. The video pertains to March 28, when Kejriwal had addressed Special Judge (PC Act) Kaveri Baweja when he was produced before the court for the second time following his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate. Advocate Vaibhav Singh argued that after Kejriwal addressed the Rouse Avenue Court on the said date, several social media handles associated with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and other Opposition parties made video/audio recordings of the court proceedings and posted them on social media platforms. Sunita Kejriwal also reposted an audio recording uploaded by an X user. Singh argued that recording of court proceedings is prohibited under the \"High Court of Delhi Rules for Video Conferencing for Courts 2021\" and making these videos viral was an effort to malign the image of the judiciary and the judges. He said that posting such videos was part of the conspiracy hatched by Arvind Kejriwal and the AAP."

Kumar is accused of assaulting AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal on May 13 at the chief minister's official residence. Kumar was produced through video conferencing before the duty metropolitan magistrate, who extended the custody and directed the Delhi Police to produce him on June 22. Earlier on Friday, the court had extended Kumar's custody by one day after noting that the investigating officer (IO) was not present. Kumar was arrested on May 18. He was sent to police custody for five days the same day by a magisterial court, which observed that his anticipatory bail plea had become infructuous because of his arrest. On May 24, he was sent to four days judicial custody, following which he was again remanded in police custody for three days. An FIR was registered against Kumar on May 16 under various Indian Penal Code provisions, including those related to criminal intimidation, assault or criminal force on a woman with the intent to disrobe and attempt to commit culpable homicide."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Rouse Avenue Court in Delhi on Wednesday extended Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's judicial custody till July 3. The court was hearing Kejriwal's petition seeking regular bail . The Enforcement Directorate told the Rouse Avenue Court that it had evidence of Arvind Kejriwal demanding Rs 100 crore as kickbacks in the now withdrawn liquor policy case. Additional Solicitor General SV Raju said the court had taken cognisance of the offence of money laundering in the case. He also said the rejection of the bail application of co-accused, including former Delhi minister Manish Sisodia, in the money laundering case showed that the court was accepting the charge of money laundering. \"The court's cognisance of money laundering shows that prima facie the court is convinced that a case of money laundering is made here. The CBI probe revealed that Kejriwal had demanded a bribe of Rs 100 crore. We had collected evidence even before the arrest,\" ASG Raju, representing the ED, said. The Delhi Chief Minister was produced before the court through video conference. Kejriwal's lawyer Vikram Chaudhary argued that the AAP supremo had not been named in any chargesheet filed under PMLA. \"Even in the FIR lodged by the CBI, Kejriwal has not been named as an accused,\" Chaudhary said. \"Whatever allegations the ED is making, it seems that they are prosecuting me not under the PMLA but in the CBI case,\" he further said. He also pointed out that the Supreme Court, in its order on May 10, had said that Kejriwal could file a bail petition in the lower court. Kejriwal's lawyer said that the entire case was based only on the statements of witnesses who were arrested earlier, and were promised bail. \"They were promised pardon... they are not saints. These people were lured. The credibility of these people is also questioned. The whole case started in August 2022 and Kejriwal's arrest took place in March 2024, just before the elections. There is also a malice behind the timing of Kejriwal's arrest,\" he further said."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Delhi’s Rouse Avenue Court on Wednesday posed questions to the Enforcement Directorate regarding the progress of its probe into the Delhi excise policy scam case . It also criticised the investigating officer for being unable to answer the court’s questions. Special CBI Judge Nyay Bindu, presiding over the vacation bench hearing a case related to the judicial custody of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and another accused, Vinod Chauhan, questioned the investigating officer about the extent of the completed investigation. When the court was informed that approximately Rs 45 crores out of the Rs100 core had been traced so far, Justice Bindu expressed surprise that around 60 per cent of the alleged amount still remain untraceable. The court also noted that the investigating officer was unable to provide satisfactory responses. \"For the last 6 months you are the IO [investigating officer] and you are not in a position to answer my questions? It should be on your tips. I’m not aware of the case, but you should be,\" the court said. The court was also hearing Kejriwal's petition seeking regular bail . Kejriwal’s lawyer highlighted before the court that the Enforcement Directorate hasn’t even completed the probe yet, as stated by the investigating officer himself, adding that out of Rs 100 crores, only Rs 45 crores have been traced. Later during the bail hearing, the court also refused to grant the probe agency’s request for 2-3 days to file its written submissions. The court pointed out that postponing further arguments would be futile, as a different vacation judge would preside over the bench after Thursday. The judge also dismissed Additional Solicitor General SV Raju’s suggestion that the court may reserve its order, which could be pronounced after court vacations are over. The court clarified that the agency has already presented its arguments at length and can take additional time to argue further. Once all arguments are heard, the court will pronounce its order instead of reserving it for a later date. The court will continue to hear the case and is expected to issue its order on Thursday."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Delhi's Rouse Avenue Court on Thursday reserved its order on Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's bail application in a money laundering case related to the alleged excise scam. The court also reserved orders on a plea by Arvind Kejriwal to allow his wife, Sunita Kejriwal, to join virtual proceedings when he is subjected to a medical examination to assess his health condition in jail. Special Judge Niyay Bindu reserved the bail order after hearing arguments from the accused as well as the Enforcement Directorate on the application. On Wednesday, the court extended Kejriwal's judicial custody till July 3 in the case. During the hearing, the Enforcement Directorate today claimed there was a complete and direct money trail of proceeds of transfer from the South Group to the Aam Aadmi Party. The probe agency's statement came while it opposed Arvind Kejriwal's bail application in the money laundering case. (Last year, allegations of AAP leaders accepting bribes from a group of southern politicians, whom the Enforcement Directorate later designated as the 'South Group', surfaced.) In the court, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju, appearing for the Enforcement Directorate, said the probe agency was not investigating in the air, and that there was concrete evidence in the case. \"There are documents showing the payments,\" the ASG said, as he referred to documents regarding certain transactions. The ASG also referred to a previous order denying bail to Chanpreet Singh, who was arrested in April this year, and allegedly \"managed\" the AAP's funds for the Goa assembly elections. \"Chanpreet Singh received huge cash amounts from entrepreneurs and paid bills for the hotel for Arvind Kejriwal. He was handling Goa elections and was supervising the campaign. Therefore, he received the cash,\" he told the court. Referring to the Enforcement Directorate's reply, where the probe agency presented a screenshot of a currency note, the ASG said, \"It's not that the Enforcement Directorate is doing an investigation in the air. There is concrete evidence.\" Further, the ASG said, \"Chanpreet is regularly in touch with Vinod Chauhan (another accused in the liquor policy case) via WhatsApp. We have established that cash has gone.\" \"Now establishing a link that Arvind Kejriwal had good relations with Vinod Chauhan. What has a Chief Minister to do with a person who has actually transferred cash for Goa elections? This shows the link,\" he told the court."

The order was passed by Rouse Avenue Court's vacation Judge Nyay Bindu after reserving it earlier today. After the order was passed, the ED requested the court to give 48 hours to it to exercise its legal remedies. However, the judge refused to stay the order. The ED has decided to challenge the bail order before the Delhi High Court. The AAP supremo can walk out of Tihar Jail on Friday after paying a bail bond of Rs 1 lakh. AAP workers burst firecrackers outside the Delhi Chief Minister's residence as soon as the order was pronounced. AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said Kejriwal's release would \"strengthen democracy\". \"ED's statements till now were based on lies... this is a baseless fake case formed to trap Kejriwal,\" Sanjay Singh said. #WATCH | Firecrackers being burst by AAP workers outside the residence of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi. Delhi's Rouse Avenue Court today granted bail to CM Kejriwal on a bond of Rs 1 lakh in the excise policy case. pic.twitter.com/ROOq0FVP4K — ANI (@ANI) June 20, 2024 Kejriwal is the second AAP leader after Sanjay Singh to be granted bail in the case. Former Delhi minister Manish Sisodia continues to languish in Tihar Jail. Kejriwal was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on March 21 in dramatic scenes just ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. In May, he was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court in view of general elections. He surrendered on June 2. During the hearing, the ED claimed it had evidence of Arvind Kejriwal demanding Rs 100 crore as kickbacks in the liquor policy case. The central probe agency also alleged that kickbacks received from liquor sellers were used to fund AAP's poll campaign in Goa. Additional Solicitor General SV Raju also said there was a direct money trail of proceeds of crime being transferred from the South Group, of which BRS leader K Kavitha was a part, to the AAP. ASG Raju also claimed that Kejriwal refused to give the password of his phone during the investigation. \"Kejriwal says my phone is sacrosanct. Mai password nahi dunga . (I will not give my password). We had to resort to the phone of Vinod Chauhan (accused in the case). He is sitting quiet. An adverse inference has to be drawn from the fact that Kejriwal has refused to give his password. This is a ground for refusing bail under ordinary bail law, forget section 45 PMLA for the time being,\" ASG Raju said. The ASG claimed that Vinod Chauhan was managing transfers and postings of Delhi government officials. Meanwhile, Kejriwal, represented by senior advocate Vikram Chaudhary, claimed that the ED's allegations were not backed by any proof and punched holes into their claims. He also argued that the AAP supremo had not been named in any chargesheet filed under PMLA. \"Is ED an independent agency or playing in the hands of some political masters? The ED draws all its conclusions based on hypothesis,\" Chaudhary said. \"They say I am the national convenor of AAP and that's why I am responsible for everything done by the party. There is nothing to show that Rs 45 crore was ever received by AAP. This is all in the realm of speculation, prejudices and beliefs. They are still arresting and evaluating but keep on making a statement that Rs 100 crore bribe was received,\" Chaudhary further said."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Enforcement Directorate is likely to challenge the regular bail granted to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the Delhi excise policy case . The central probe agency will be moving the Delhi High Court against the order by Rouse Avenue Courts’ Vacation Judge Nyay Bindu under Section 45 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Offences under the stringent PMLA are cognisable and non-bailable. According to Section 45, bail can be granted only if the court is prima facie satisfied that the accused has not committed the offence and that he is unlikely to commit any offence while on bail. Also, the Public Prosecutor shall be given an opportunity to oppose the application for release. Bail can be granted to an accused in a money laundering case only if these twin conditions are satisfied, making it almost impossible for an accused to get bail under the PMLA. In 2022, while hearing a batch of petitions against various provisions of the Act, the Supreme Court upheld the 'twin bail' conditions as well. Supreme Court judge (retired) AM Khanwilkar had compared money laundering to terrorism and argued that such stringent provisions were needed to create a deterrent effect. He further said that even a plea for anticipatory bail would need to undergo the rigours of the 'twin bail' conditions. The ruling was challenged by a batch of petitioners before the top court, and a new three-judge bench is considering a review of its decision in a case which had held Section 45 to be constitutional. However, the Centre, in its brief arguments before the Supreme Court, argued that the stringent bail conditions under Section 45 were necessary to give effect to the international standards of preventing money laundering prescribed by FATF and other international treaties. Meanwhile, Kejriwal's lawyers are likely to submit the bail bond of Rs 1 Lakh before the court on Friday, after which he would be released from Tihar Jail."

Kejriwal's lawyers are likely to submit the bail bond of Rs 1 lakh before the court later today, after which he will be released from Tihar jail, where he has been lodged since June 2 after his interim bail ended. His wife, Sunita Kejriwal, is likely to go to the high-security prison at 4 PM today, sources said. The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, said it would file a plea in the Delhi High Court against the relief to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo if he walks out of jail. This comes after the Rouse Avenue court rejected the federal probe agency's prayer to keep the bail order in abeyance for 48 hours to allow it to avail legal remedies like moving a higher court in appeal. The court imposed certain conditions before granting relief to Kejriwal , including that he will not try to hamper the investigation or influence the witnesses. The judge also directed the AAP chief to appear before the court whenever required and to cooperate with the investigation. The ED had arrested Kejriwal on March 21, shortly after the Delhi High Court refused to grant him protection from arrest on his petition challenging summonses issued to him. On May 10, the Supreme Court had granted interim bail to Kejriwal till June 1 to campaign in the Lok Sabha elections, saying he will have to surrender and go back to jail on June 2. The trial court had on June 5 denied him interim bail which he sought citing several ailments. During the hearing on Thursday, the ED claimed it had evidence of Arvind Kejriwal demanding Rs 100 crore as kickbacks in the liquor policy case. The central probe agency also alleged that kickbacks received from liquor sellers were used to fund AAP's poll campaign in Goa.

The ED has appealed to the Delhi High Court to set aside the order granting bail to Kejriwal by the trial court. The Delhi High Court agreed to hear the ED’s plea promptly. Reacting to the situation, Sunita Kejriwal pointed out how the ED had approached the Delhi High Court opposing the bail even before the order was uploaded. She alleged that her husband was being treated like a wanted terrorist by the government and its central agencies. \"It has become like this... as if Arvind Kejriwal is the most wanted terrorist... Dictatorship has increased in the country,\" she said. \"The decision is yet to come in the High Court... We hope that the High Court will do justice,\" she added. AAP leader Sanjay Singh also criticised the Delhi High court's decision to put a hold on the bail order, and accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of making a mockery of the justice system. Taking to X, Singh said in a post in Hindi, \"Look at the hooliganism of the Modi government, the trial court's order has not yet come, even a copy of the order has not been received, so Modi's ED reached the High Court to challenge which order? What is happening in this country? \"Modi ji, why are you making a mockery of the justice system? The whole country is watching you?\" the AAP MP said. The ED requested an urgent hearing on its plea, which the Delhi High Court agreed to take up. Senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Vikram Chaudhari, representing Arvind Kejriwal, urged the court to prioritise the hearing, arguing that the matter should be addressed out of turn. Additional Solicitor General SV Raju, representing the ED in the High Court, sought a stay on the trial court order contending that the agency was not given a proper opportunity to argue its case."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Delhi High Court on Friday directed an interim stay on the trial court order granting bail to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the liquor policy case till the pronouncement of its verdict on ED's petition. The Delhi Chief Minister will remain in Tihar jail for now. The order is likely to be pronounced on June 25. \"I am reserving the order for two to three days. Till pronouncement of the order, the operation of the trial court order is stayed,\" the court said. Justice Sudhir Kumar Jain passed the order after the ED moved the High Court challenging Thursday's trial court order. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju, representing the ED, told the High Court that he was not given the \"full opportunity\" to argue his case. \" There can't be a more perverse order than this . Without going through documents filed by both sides, without giving us an opportunity, the matter is decided,\" he said. He argued that he was not given sufficient time to argue the case or to file written submissions, alleging that the judge was in a hurry to conduct the hearing and hurriedly disposed of the case. He said it was on record that the judge called the documents submitted \"bulky\" and refused to go through them. \"A judge who admits that [they] haven't read the papers and grants bail, there cannot be greater perversity than this. This order has to go on this finding alone,\" Raju argued. Citing Section 45 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), Raju urged the court to stay the bail order. He expressed strong objections to the trial court’s handling of the case, claiming that it didn't take note of the submissions made by the ED. \"I am shocked that despite submitting the written note, the court is saying ED hasn't been able to prove its case. You can decide against me, but don't give wrong facts,\" Raju said, reading from the trial court’s judgment. Detailing the ED's evidence against Kejriwal, the ASG argued that the trial court dismissed significant findings. \"We have shown all this to show that he had a role in the demand for Rs 100 crore. Yet the judge says no direct evidence. Direct evidence is in the form of a statement. There is corroboration also,\" he explained. Raju criticised the trial court’s rationale for granting bail. \" Holding a constitutional chair is a ground for bail? That means every minister will be granted bail. You are a Chief Minister, so you will be granted bail. Unheard of, there cannot be anything more perverse than this,\" he said. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Kejriwal, said the approach of the ED was deplorable . Countering ASG Raju's arguments, Singhvi said, \"He (ASG) says the order is perverse and therefore limits to one small aspect. Like Alice in Wonderland, ED has its own understanding of perversity .\" Singhvi said the High Court and Supreme Court were dealing with the issue of legality of the arrest, not the bail. \"The Supreme Court has reserved its order on the legality of the arrest... The law is very clear on the grant of bail and cancellation/reversal of bail is different,\" he further said. The senior advocate further said \"not one paisa\" was traced to Arvind Kejriwal. \"For ED, Article 21 is non-existent. The liberty of a person is very, very low in the eyes of the ED, if it exists at all,\" he further said. Singhvi also pointed out how accused Sarath Reddy, the director of Aurobindo Pharma, is out on bail due to back pain. \"There are nine statements not implicating Kejriwal. After these statements, he implicates me, and then he gets bail due to back pain without any objection,\" the senior lawyer said. Senior advocate Vikram Chaudhary also countered ASG Raju, saying ED's stand is my way or the highway . \"All these submissions are not correct. They argued at length. Seven hours of arguments are not enough? Someone should gracefully accept something,\" Chaudhary said. Kejriwal was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on March 21 in dramatic scenes just ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. In May, he was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court in view of general elections. He surrendered on June 2."

The court said, “This is the call of the day that the government authorities and the Higher Courts want to reduce the pendency of cases and to expedite the proceedings”. Justice Bindu added that both the top court and the High Courts have been emphasising to trial courts the importance of considering the constitutional rights of undertrials. The court also quoted the words of American statesman Benjamin Franklin: \"It is better that 100 guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person should suffer,\" and stressed that this principle cannot be ignored. According to the court, this principle imposes a duty not only to prevent guilty individuals from escaping justice but also to ensure that no innocent person is punished. “There have been thousands of cases where the accused have undergone long-lasting trial and agony resulting from the same until they were acquitted by the court for being innocent. Unfortunately, the mental and physical agony of such individuals cannot be compensated in any manner whatsoever,” noted the bail order. The special court bench also cited the words of Lord Chief Justice of England, Lord Hewart: \"Justice should not only be done but should be seen to be done.\" “If an accused has undergone the atrocities of the system until his innocence is realised, then he could never conceive that 'JUSTICE' has actually been done in his favour,” the order noted. However, the Delhi High Court stayed the trial court's order granting bail to Kejriwal. The court stated that it was reserving the order for 2-3 days as it wanted to review the entire records."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story There was chaos in South Delhi's Bhogal where Delhi Water Minister Atishi continued her indefinite hunger strike, which entered the second day on Saturday, over the water crisis in the national capital. Protesters raised slogans against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, following which they were taken out by AAP workers. Atishi sat on an indefinite fast on Friday, alleging that Haryana was not releasing Delhi's rightful share of water in Yamuna. In a video message from her 'Jal Satyagrah' venue, Atishi said she will not eat anything till Haryana releases more water for the people in the city. Atishi said 110 million gallons per day (MGD) less water was released by Haryana on Friday. \"One MGD water provides for 28,000 people. Shortage of 100 MGD water means 28 lakh people are not getting water in Delhi,\" she said. A video from the protest site, showed people enraged, as an announcement was being made, asking them not to create chaos. AAP VS BJP OVER ATISHI'S HUNGER STRIKE BJP MP Bansuri Swaraj termed Atishi's fast a \"sham\", alleging it was a \"political drama\" to hide her \"inaction\". \"Atishi is an unsuccessful water minister. It was clear since February this year that Delhi would endure a long summer, but she made no preparations for it,\" Swaraj charged. Attacking Atishi, BJP's Delhi unit on Saturday posted a video showing no AAP leaders at the protest site. \"What kind of indefinite Satyagraha is this, where Atishi goes to eat and rest in an AC room during lunch time and at night! A big scam is going on,\" BJP's Delhi unit tweeted. Soon, AAP leader Sanjay Singh hit back at the BJP and tweeted, \"Fraudsters of BJP should know that whoever sits on Ansan, their medical check up is done by doctors. Medical reports are prepared. Send your Union Minister, Send Nayab Singh Saini — if you are wrong, give Delhi its share of water.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday claimed that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s health has been deteriorating rapidly since his arrest. The party claimed that Kejriwal has lost 8 kg since his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate on March 21 in the Delhi liquor policy case. Initially weighing 70 kg at the time of his arrest, Kejriwal's weight had dropped to a concerning 62 kg by June 22, according to AAP. “The continuous weight loss, deemed very serious by the doctors, highlights the necessity for immediate and thorough medical evaluations to address and understand the root cause of Arvind Kejriwal’s health decline,” said AAP. The party added that Arvind Kejriwal’s health has been declining and said that the persistent weight loss prompted the AIIMS medical board to advise the inclusion of 'parathas' and 'puri' in Kejriwal’s diet to help mitigate this issue. “We had demanded an extension of Arvind Kejriwal's interim bail for a week. Because even then, we feared that Arvind Kejriwal's health needed to be thoroughly examined. Doctors of Max Hospital had advised to get several tests done given Arvind Kejriwal's decreasing weight,” the AAP mentioned. The party further alleged that despite urgent recommendations from doctors at Max Hospital for a comprehensive medical test of Kejriwal, only some blood tests were conducted on the jailed Chief Minister. The AAP alleged that critical heart tests and cancer screening tests are pending. The Delhi Chief Minister was arrested in March in a money laundering case linked to the now-scrapped Excise Policy. He was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court for 21 days to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls. Kejriwal had asked for the interim bail to be extended further, but his request was turned down. A trial court on Thursday granted bail to Arvind Kejriwal but the Delhi High Court ordered an interim stay on a trial court's order."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday moved the Supreme Court against the Delhi High Court's stay on his bail order in the liquor policy case. The high court had directed an interim stay on the trial court order granting bail to Kejriwal and had adjourned the case till June 25. \"High Court has lost sight of the most objective criteria that is required to judge an application for cancellation of bail and therefore, the impugned order staying the operation of the order granting bail cannot sustain even for a day,\" the plea stated. Kejriwal's lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to take up the case on Monday. \"The manner adopted by the High Court in staying the bail order is contrary to the said clear dicta of law laid down by this Hon’ble Court and would violate the basic fundamental threshold on which the bail jurisprudence is premised in our country,\" the plea stated. The plea states that the Aam Aadmi Party chief cannot be denied the due process of law nor \"false case\" can be cooked up against him \"merely because the petitioner is a political figure and opposed to the present dispensation in power in Centre\". \"Petitioner is gravely aggrieved by the impugned order which has rendered justice to be a casualty and the same ought not to be continued even for a moment any further. This Hon’ble Court has repeatedly held that 'deprivation of liberty even for single day is one too many',\" the plea stated. Kejriwal was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on March 21 in connection with the Delhi liquor policy case, just before the Lok Sabha elections. In May, he was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court in view of general elections. He surrendered on June 2."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Supreme Court on Monday advised Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to wait for the Delhi High Court's decision on his bail plea in a money laundering case linked to the now-scrapped Delhi liquor policy. The AAP chief had filed a petition in the top court challenging the Delhi High Court's pause on the bail granted to him by a lower court last week. While pausing the bail, the court said it would pronounce its order on June 25. A bench comprising Justices Manoj Misra and SV Bhatti presided over the proceedings, where senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Vikram Chaudhary represented Kejriwal, and Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Raju appeared for the Enforcement Directorate (ED). During arguments, Singhvi said the Delhi High Court did not wait for the trial court's bail order before putting a hold on it. \"If the High Court can stay it without seeing the order, why can't your lordships stay the High Court order\" he argued. At this, Justice Misra responded, \"If the High Court has committed a mistake, should we repeat it?\" Singhvi further stated that the stay on the bail order was unprecedented and declared that Kejriwal was not a flight risk. The bench indicated that the final order could be expected imminently and advised all parties to wait patiently. At this, Singhvi raised concerns about the loss of time after obtaining bail. \"Why can't I be free in the interim? I have a judgment in my favour,\" Singhvi argued. \"If we pass an order now, we will be prejudging the issue. It is not a subordinate court, it is a High Court,\" Justice Misra said. The bench further questioned the urgency, asking why waiting for a day would be problematic. Senior advocate Vikram Chaudhary referred to the Supreme Court's May 10 order granting Kejriwal interim bail and noted the court's observations that Kejriwal, as the Chief Minister of Delhi, had no criminal antecedents, posed no threat to the investigation, and had only been arrested in March 2024, despite the investigation being ongoing since August 2022. Chaudhary also highlighted the May 17 order where the Supreme Court reserved judgment on Kejriwal's challenge to his arrest, allowing him the liberty to apply for bail. The ED's lawyer, ASG Raju, countered and said the trial court's bail order was perverse. After listening to arguments from both sides, the top court said it did not wish to pressure the High Court over a matter that was \"not high-profile\". However, it observed, \"Normally, in stay applications, orders are not reserved. They are passed on the spot. What has happened here is a bit unusual.\" Adjourning the hearing, the bench said if the High Court's order is passed in the meantime, it can be brought on record. Kejriwal's plea will be taken up again on Wednesday, June 26."

Days after a split verdict in the national elections on February 8, several political parties in Pakistan are stepping up their efforts to form a federal government. While Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party-backed independent candidates dominated the election results, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) claimed to have enough numbers to form the government as some independents joined the Nawaz Sharif-led party post-polls.

The Left-wing gained political ground in the South American nation of Brazil, where Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva snatched power from Jair Messias Bolsonaro and joined the government. In February, Syria and Turkey were struck by massive earthquakes that claimed the lives of several people. In the latter part of this, India successfully hosted the G20 Summit at Delhi's Bharat Mandapam. In October, a massive conflict broke out between Israel and Hamas after the latter attacked the Jewish nation on October 7. The label \"world's largest open-air prison\" underscores the severe movement and economic restrictions faced by nearly 2 million residents of Gaza, primarily imposed by Israel, but Egypt also controls one of Gaza's borders and at times has restricted movement.

In this episode of World Today, we will look into the outcome of the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC) CoP 28 Summit that recently concluded in UAE's Dubai. Nearly 200 countries on Wednesday clinched a deal that called for a “transition away from fossil fuels,” the primary reason for the planet’s climate crisis, at the UN climate summit here, a development described as a \"landmark\" by negotiators but criticised by several activists for its lack of clarity. Adopted after nearly two weeks of hectic negotiations, it urges countries to accelerate efforts toward the phase-down of unabated coal power, which is a climb down after India and China strongly resisted the singling out of coal. Hamas released 24 hostages on Friday during the first day of the war's first truce, including Israeli women and children and Thai farm workers, after guns fell silent across the Gaza Strip for the first time in seven weeks. The hostages were transferred out of Gaza and handed over to Egyptian authorities at the Rafah border crossing, accompanied by eight staff members of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in a four-car convoy, the ICRC said. Populist politician Geert Wilders' hopes of establishing a right-wing government in the Netherlands hit an early hurdle on Friday as the party whose support he needs most ruled out directly joining a new cabinet. \"Voters have spoken and they have told us to skip this round,\" said Dilan Yesilgoz, the new leader of outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte's conservative VVD party, which lost seats and finished third in Wednesday's election. As the Israel-Hamas war escalates with every passing day, the international community is unable to come out with a voice supporting or standing against either of the two warring sides."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The practice of gifting is a universal love language and a cherished tradition globally. However, the exchange of gifts has changed tremendously over the centuries. For instance, there was a time when people appreciated simple yet meaningful gifts like food, handmade tools, and even livestock. Different cultures focused on their unique gifting traditions. Today, giving a gift is more than handing over an object wrapped in a cover. It's communication where you express love and gratitude. You tell someone that you appreciate them and are happy for them by sending them a bouquet of their favourite flowers or the sweets they like the most. The rules of gifting are no longer rigid or limited. All you need to know is from the expert Paridhi Joshi, AVP at FNP. 1. GLOBALISATION DRIVES GIFTING TRENDS Globalisation has blended diverse gifting rituals. In India, exchanging gifts is not limited to festivals like Diwali or Rakshabandhan. For example, there is a widespread trend of gifting during Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, etc. The Westernisation of gift-giving practices has also introduced a fusion of traditions, like gifting during Karva Chauth. Another global gifting trend is spontaneous gifting. Earlier, gifts were exchanged only on special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, or holidays. Nowadays, gift-giving goes beyond special occasions. People often value gifts more when given unexpectedly, simply as a gesture of thoughtfulness. 2. PERSONALISATION OF GIFTS People are increasingly appreciating gifts that showcase thought and consideration. For example, a birthday bouquet featuring the recipient's birthday flower can be significant. Similarly, at a housewarming party, a personalised nameplate or blanket adds a special touch. Personalised jewellery with significant names or dates is a thoughtful and memorable gift. Personalisation makes gifting thoughtful, showing that extra effort was put into choosing them. 3. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND MODERN TRENDS Technology has revolutionised the way we give gifts. E-commerce has made it easier to buy and send gifts online. Online gift registries and digital gift cards have also become popular, allowing people to choose their gifts. Personalised and experiential gifts are another trend enabled by technology. Custom-made items, virtual experiences, and subscription services are now easily accessible. These gifts offer unique and memorable experiences. 4. SUSTAINABILITY AND ETHICAL GIFTING Sustainability has become a crucial aspect of gifting. There is a growing trend towards environment-friendly and handmade gifts. People choose reusable products, items made from recycled materials, and locally crafted goods. Ethical gifting also includes supporting fair trade and small businesses. These choices not only show thoughtfulness but also contribute to a better world. 5. CORPORATE GIFTING Corporate gifting has also emerged as a significant trend. Companies now recognise the importance of giving thoughtful gifts to employees, clients, and partners. These gifts, from branded merchandise to personalised items, help strengthen professional relationships, boost morale, and enhance brand loyalty. Corporate gifting is about expressing appreciation and building a positive work culture. With the rise of customisation options, businesses can tailor gifts to reflect their values and the individual preferences of recipients, making the gesture even more impactful. CONCLUSION Gifting has come a long way, from simple, practical items to various trendy presents. Whether a handmade item or a digital gift card, the heart of gifting stays the same: showing someone you care. As we look ahead, the ways we give gifts may change, but the essence of showing love, care, and appreciation remains the same."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A restaurant in Ahmedabad was sealed after a couple allegedly found a “dead rat” in sambhar that has served to them on June 20. Avinash, an Ahmedabad resident, claimed that he found the “dead rat” in sambhar that was served at Devi Dosa Palace, the restaurant located in the Nikol area of the city. Along with his wife, Avinash visited Devi Dosa Palace as the couple placed an order for a dosa. Sambhar and chutney were served to them before their order arrived. While having the sambhar, Avinash was left in an utter state of shock as he allegedly found a “dead rat” in it. Avinash alerted the restaurant staff immediately and also reported it to the municipal authorities in Ahmedabad. The restaurant, upon inspection, was sealed by the authorities. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation mentioned in a notice during the sealing that due to the kitchen being in the open, there is a possibility of creatures or insects falling into the food. The hotel will remain closed until further notice, authorities said. Speaking to news agency ANI about the incident, Bhavin Joshi, Food Safety Officer at Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, said: \"I appeal to all the business operators of Ahmedabad Corporation to be very careful with the food they serve to the customers so that such incidents can be avoided.\" Several such incidents have been reported over the past week that have raised concerns regarding food safety in India. For instance, a woman claimed that she found a “dead mouse” in a bottle of Hershey’s chocolate syrup . Her complaint prompted a response from the confectionary company as well who said that the incident will be investigated. A couple travelling via Vande Bharat also alleged that they found a “cockroach” in their meal that was served onboard. The official X account of the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) issued an apology soon after and said that a penalty was imposed on the service provider. Last week, a resident of Mumbai found a \"human finger\" with a nail on it in ice cream that he ordered online."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Australia coach Andrew McDonald defended the decision to drop Mitchell Starc for Ashton Agar in the loss to Afghanistan on June 23, Sunday. Starc, who has been operating as one of the main bowlers for the Aussies, was surprisingly dropped for the game, which could have potentially sealed Australia's qualification into the semis. However, they ended up losing the game by 21 runs. Agar, who played the game ahead of Starc , conceded only 17 runs in his 4 overs, but went wicketless in the end. Speaking at the press conference ahead of the high-stakes India game, McDonald admitted it was a tough call to leave Starc out of the side but felt Agar was best suited for the conditions. India vs Australia, Super 8: Predicted XI | Weather Forecast \"It's always a tough decision to leave Mitch Starc out of a team, but I think as you saw from the way the game unfolded, I think Ashton was suited to these conditions and we needed to make room. We knew that we were going to need more than eight overs to spin on that surface and it's probably something we've been planning and preparing for once we knew we were at this venue and we look at our squad of 15 and set it before the tournament.\" \"We're going to need options and flexibility, but it's always a difficult decision. You never know whether it's going to be right or wrong, but I thought Ashton bowled incredibly well today. Used his skill, some good arm balls, found some purchase early, and he made it tricky to navigate through those first few overs, and we got two out of the power play, which then set up, clearly, the bowling from that end with him and Zamps operating. Unfortunately, we weren't able to take those early wickets, had a couple of opportunities and no doubt we'll speak about the fielding,\" said McDonald. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats McDonald said he was comfortable with the decision to drop Starc for the game and claimed they have trust in the players who they call into the side. \"When you're hopping around the islands, the conditions change dramatically, and we got what we expected,\" McDonald said. \"I was comfortable with that decision and now we've got to turn our focus to India: a totally different line-up on a totally different surface, and we've got to make good decisions at the selection table. \"That's part of the art of navigating through a World Cup, to get those decisions right - and you can't play the same game twice. You can't put Mitchell Starc in there, or Nathan Ellis, and work out what the game would have looked like. We went to Ash and backed him in, and we've got full trust in whoever we call on in that 15 to get a job done and we've got a task ahead.\" Australia will face India in St. Lucia in a must-win game on June 24."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Indian men can legally rape their wives. Marriage is a licence to rape in India. No doesn't mean no in a marriage in India. Not all rape is rape in India. Let's now say it this way -- India's rape laws don't apply if a man rapes his wife . Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code defines rape as \" non-consensual sexual intercourse with a woman \". However, it exempts the husband from any penal consequences if he forces intercourse on his wife without her consent, given that his wife is above the age of 15 years. The 15 years bit was written down to 18 years by the Supreme Court. Marriage in India under the law means irrevocable implied consent. The latest decision by the Chhattisgarh High Court, found atrocious by many, shouldn't surprise . After all, the learned Chhattisgarh High Court judge NK Chandravanshi was only quoting from the law of the land when he cleared a man, accused of raping his wife, with the verdict that sexual intercourse by a man with his wife is not rape -- even if it is by force or against her wish. Strangely, High Courts in India have often differed on the legality and definition of marital rape. Last month, the Kerala High Court ruled that marital rape, though not recognised under the penal code, could still be considered grounds for divorce as a form of cruelty. The Kerala High Court noted, \"Treating wife's body as something owing to husband and committing a sexual act against her will is nothing but marital rape. Right to respect for his or her physical and mental integrity encompasses bodily integrity, and any disrespect or violation of bodily integrity is a violation of individual autonomy.\" Juxtapose this with the Chhattisgarh High Court verdict and you find yourself in a legal paradox . In 2018, the Gujarat High Court had ruled that non-consensual intercourse by a husband was not rape. The same year, the Delhi High Court observed that both men and women had a right to say \"no\" and that marriage did not mean consent. While one would think the Supreme Court would have given more clarity and stepped into the sexist cesspit of misogyny giving women legal protection. What the apex court has done over decades is look the other way and fail abysmally to protect the rights of women. In March this year, an open letter was penned by over 5,000 women rights activists in India asking the then chief justice SA Bobde to step down and apologise. What the chief justice had done to invoke such disgust was ask two questions. Justice Bobde had asked a man accused of raping a minor girl if he was ready to marry her . The other appalling question in a different case of marital rape from the chief justice was: \"When two people are living as husband and wife, however brutal the husband is, can the act of sexual intercourse between them be called rape?\" Do such questions give legitimacy to sexual violence in a country that is usually over-eager to normalise it? I'm going to leave this question open-ended because while the legality of marital rape is clear, the matter of contempt of court is rather gray. The best that the highest court in our country has done is to rule in 2017 that sex with a minor wife will amount to rape. It watered down the exception to section 375 of the IPC which said sexual intercourse by a man with his wife not under the age of 15 would not amount to rape. All that the Indian judiciary has done is raise the age from 15 to 18. In effect, if your wife is 18, you have a hall pass for spousal rape. The executive and the legislature have not been very different from the judiciary. Marital rape has been criminalised in more than 100 countries. But India stands tall in the luminous league of about 32 countries where marital rape is not criminalised. Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Botswana, Iran, Nigeria and Libya are some of the esteemed members of this extraordinary league. Our penal laws, handed down from the British, remain cast in stone, while the English themselves criminalised marital rape way back in 1991. An irony long eclipsed by the great Indian patriarchal mindset. In 2013, A UN committee recommended that the Indian government criminalise marital rape. The JS Verma committee set up in the aftermath of the Nirbhaya protests also recommended the same. There have been many committees, many reports, but the fine print remains the same. Successive governments in India have shown no will or interest, remaining in denial of women's right to their bodies after marriage. It is all but a little disconcerting that our lawmakers need to be made to understand that a marriage should not be viewed as a licence for the husband to rape his wife, but history stands testimony it has been a big ask. The Law Commission in its 172nd report had opposed criminalising marital rape on the ground \"that it may amount to excessive interference with the marital relationship\" and said forced sexual intercourse by a husband can be treated as an offence just like any other physical violence by a man against his wife. While a parliamentary standing committee has said if marital rape was made a crime, the family system will be under stress and it could lead to practical difficulties. In 2016, the government told the Rajya Sabha that the concept of marital rape was an international one and cannot be applied in the Indian context due to factors of poverty, illiteracy, social customs, religious beliefs and the 'sanctimony of marriage' In 2018, a private Bill called the Women's Sexual, Reproductive and Menstrual Rights Bill, 2018, introduced by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor in the Lok Sabha, sought to criminalise marital rape. The bill lapsed after failure to garner support from the government. Article 14 of the Indian Constitution ensures that \"[t]he State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.\" Although the Constitution guarantees equality to all, Indian criminal law discriminates against women, women who are raped by their husbands. Cringe-worthy, yes, but we are a country that mostly believes that once married, an Indian woman, along with much else, hands over a never-ending, irrevocable and perpetual consent to her husband that should only be revoked till death do them apart."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story \"Pakistan is now a fait accompli, and it can never be undone,\" said the Islamic republic's founding father Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He couldn't have been farther from the truth. In two decades, Pakistan was to see the landmark National Assembly elections of 1970, which split the country into two. It was 1970, and Pakistan was going to hold its first 'real' election, based on universal suffrage and direct voting. They also had a new National Assembly building ready to convene business after it became an Islamic Republic in 1956, nine years after its Independence in 1947. Till then, Pakistan had seen seven Prime Ministers and two instances of martial law regimes. It was an election that not only shaped the destiny of Pakistan but also set the stage for the creation of a new country —Bangladesh. The nail-biting contest between Nawaz Sharif's party and Imran Khan-backed Independent candidates brings to mind the landmark election of 1970. With reports of violence, communication seizure and allegations of mismanagement , it is impossible not to draw parallels with the National Assembly elections of 1970. The 1970 election gave Pakistan a couple of options, like the 2024 election it looks to be giving now; to restore democracy or walk on the path of turmoil and instability, which it has always walked on. The 1970 National Assembly elections were fought under the shadow of Ayub Khan's martial law, which started in 1958, and the subsequent takeover of the reign of the country by General Yahya Khan in 1969. The 1970 elections were a fierce contest between two major democratic parties: the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, based in West Pakistan, and the Awami League, under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, based in East Pakistan. West Pakistan had 138 seats, while East Pakistan had 162 seats in the National Assembly, barring the reserved seats for women. While the Awami League fielded some candidates in West Pakistan, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto ignored East Pakistan and did not field any candidates there. The 1970 election results took both Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and President Yahya Khan by surprise. They hadn't budgeted for the massive win by the Awami League. The Awami League secured an absolute majority, winning 160 of the 162 seats, sweeping East Pakistan, while the Pakistan Peoples Party won 81 seats in Punjab and Sindh, out of the 138 seats. \"The 1970 elections were a free and fair one, but the Awami League was denied its right,\" Swedish political scientist Ishtiaq Ahmed said in a YouTube interview. The results were loud and clear, and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman emerged as the leader of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The victory of the Awami League and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was not just a political triumph; it was a resounding call for autonomy from the people of East Pakistan, who were discounted as inferiors in the eyes of the Punjabi and Sindhi ruling elites of West Pakistan. The Awami League had long campaigned for substantial autonomy for the eastern wing, which felt marginalised and economically exploited by the more dominant West Pakistan. “Over the years, West Pakistan behaved like a poorly raised, egotistical guest, devouring the best dishes and leaving nothing but scraps and leftovers for East Pakistan,” noted French journalist Paul Dreyfus. However, the landmark electoral mandate of 1970 did not translate into a smooth transition of power. The ruling regime in West Pakistan, backed by the military, and led by Yahya Khan, refused to recognise the right of the Awami League to form a government. Yahya Khan prevented Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from assuming power by indefinitely delaying the convening of the National Assembly. This denial of political legitimacy and the betrayal of the mandate of East Pakistan led to widespread civil disobedience in East Pakistan under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. \"West Pakistan never treated East Pakistan based on democratic principles,\" political scientist, Ishtiaq Ahmed said. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at the Race Course Ground, Dhaka, March,1971. (Image: Getty) Meanwhile, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman spoke at a gathering, asking all elected members of the Awami League from East Pakistan to pledge to uphold nothing less than the recognition of Bangladesh. “In East Pakistan Shaikh Mujibur Rahman, through his emotional and livid speeches, spoke about the injustices meted out to Bengalis since the inception of Pakistan,” reported Pakistani nwewspaper Dawn. The call for consciousness by Sheikh Mujib followed a brutal military crackdown that would eventually spiral into a full-scale conflict, drawing India and culminating in the birth of Bangladesh in 1971. The Pakistani Armed Forces launched the infamous 'Operation Searchlight', on March 24, 1971, to suppress the protests in East Pakistan. Tanks rolled on the streets of Dhaka and the Pakistani troops massacred students and intellectuals at Dhaka University, along with numerous civilians in various parts of the city. The two-month-long, bloody operation led to widespread killings, illegal arrests and destruction in the cities of then East Pakistan. The Pakistani operations in East Pakistan reportedly killed between 3,00,000 and 3 million civilians, prompting the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to call it a 'genocide'. On March 26, 1971, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared the Independence of Bangladesh through a telegram and subsequent radio transmissions. \"This may be my last message, from today Bangladesh is independent. I call upon the people of Bangladesh wherever you might be and with whatever you have, to resist the army of occupation to the last. Your fight must go on until the last soldier of the Pakistan occupation army is expelled from the soil of Bangladesh and final victory is achieved,\" proclaimed the 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, through the Telegram, which was later broadcast by his party men. The proclamation of Independence by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the crushing defeat of the Pakistani Armed Forces at the hands of the Indian Armed Forces made sure that Pakistan now lost more than half of its population and around 20% of the land area that it exploited economically, linguistically and culturally for many decades. The 1970 National Assembly elections, not only broke Pakistan into two but proved Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah wrong."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Congress candidate Ujjwal Raman Singh on Tuesday secured a win on the Allahabad Lok Sabha seat ending the party's 40 years long dry patch when actor Amitabh Bachchan was elected. According to the Election Commission, Singh won the seat by a margin of 58,795 votes against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate Neeraj Tripathi. Singh got a total of 4,62,145 votes, while Tripathi received 4,03,350 votes. Senior Congress leader from Allahabad Baba Abhay Awasthi said that after Bachchan, who was elected from the seat in 1984, the Congress has won the seat after 40 years. He said before 1984, former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri won the election from the Allahabad parliamentary constituency in 1957 and 1962. \"After Shastri's death in 1966, his son Harikishan Shastri won the 1967 election from here,\" Awasthi said. The Congress leader added that after 1984, many big leaders like Anil Shastri, Kamla Bahuguna, Satya Prakash Malviya contested elections from this seat on Congress ticket, but lost. Since 2014, the seat has remained with the BJP with Shyam Charan Gupta winning the constituency in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and Rita Bahuguna Joshi in the 2019 polls. Singh (51), son of Samajwadi Party's stalwart leader and two-time MP from the Allahabad seat Rewati Raman Singh, has been an MLA from the Karchana seat of Prayagraj district. After the Allahabad seat was given to the Congress under the INDIA bloc, Singh left the SP and joined the Congress, which announced him as its candidate from this constituency. Tripathi (57), son of BJP leader and former West Bengal Governor late Kesari Nath Tripathi, was named as the BJP's Allahabad candidate in April, replacing outgoing MP Joshi. Earlier, Tripathi served as the additional advocate general for the Uttar Pradesh government. The Allahabad constituency falls in Prayagraj district and went to polls on May 25. The seat has over 18 lakh registered voters."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A total of 192 homeless people died due to heatwave in Delhi between June 11 to June 19, a report by the NGO Centre for Holistic Development stated. This is the highest number of deaths recorded in the said period. Notably, five people died in Delhi in the past 72 hours as the national capital continues to reel under a severe heatwave. The victims died of heatstroke at three hospitals. In Noida, too, more than 14 people died in the last 24 hours due to suspected heat stroke, according to the health department. Executive director of the NGO, Sunil Kumar Aledia, said, \"In a harrowing span from June 11 to 19, Delhi recorded the death of 192 homeless people, due to extreme heatwave conditions. This alarming statistic highlights the urgent need for proactive measures to protect one of society’s most vulnerable groups.\" A study by the NGO stated that homeless people account for 80 per cent of the unclaimed bodies of the people who died due to heatwaves. Aledia said that factors like air pollution, rapid industrialisation, urbanisation, and deforestation have resulted in rising temperatures, further aggravating the conditions for the homeless. Access to clean drinking water, essential for hydration, remains a significant challenge, thus increasing the risk of dehydration and related health complications. \"Despite the critical situation, homeless individuals frequently find themselves excluded from government welfare programs such as the Deen Dayal National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM-SUH) and the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), primarily due to the lack of identification documents and a permanent address,\" the director said. \"The absence of intermediary housing options or financial assistance leaves many with no choice but to live on the streets,\" Aledia said. \"Solutions should include establishing cooling centres, ensuring adequate shelter capacity, distributing water, and addressing the underlying causes of homelessness through supportive housing and services,\" he added."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The person in the video is a Delhi-based 22-year-old Instagram influencer named Aryan. The case of a 17-year-old from Pune allegedly killing two people after ramming into them with his luxury car has taken the nation by shock, especially because of how the Juvenile Justice Board treated him. The teen, son of real estate developer Vishal Agarwal, was initially granted bail and asked to write an essay on the incident. Many have termed this a “slap on the wrist”, highlighting how the wealthy evade justice. The Juvenile Justice Board, however, later revoked the bail and remanded the minor to its Yerawada home until June 5. Now, a video going viral on social media purports to show the same teen bragging about driving under the influence of alcohol and killing people in a profanity-laden rap song. Sharing this video on X , one person wrote, \"Shocking but true, the psychopath kill*er in the Pune Porsche case made a rap song about the accident after getting bail, mocking the deaths of the innocent victims. How can someone be so insensitive?\" Its archive can be seen here . The rap song can be heard below. (This version has been edited to block out profanities). Several Marathi news channels and websites also claimed in their reports that this video showed the Pune teen who has been accused of killing two people while drunk driving. India Today Fact Check found that the person in the video is a Delhi-based Instagram influencer named Aryan, not the teen accused in the Pune Porsche case. We found that some comments under the viral posts mentioned the person in the video was an Instagram user called \"Cringistaan2\". When we checked the account , we found another video of the person rapping about the Pune Porsche case on their Instagram Stories, shared on May 23. You can see the video below. This video too has been edited to block out profanities. India Today Fact Check then reached out to Cringistaan2 via Instagram call. The man in the video identified himself as Aryan and confirmed he made both rap videos. Aryan explained, \"The case was trending and I thought of writing a rap about it. People can take it whichever way they want, I just used my art and creativity to create a funny and satirical piece.\" Aryan is a Delhi-based 22-year-old college who claims to work as a rapper and a freelance video editor. He told India Today Fact Check that he had shared the viral video on his Instagram stories on May 23, which remained there for 24 hours. Meanwhile, the accused's mother Shivani Agarwal shared her video with India Today correspondent Divesh Singh. In the video, she can be seen holding a smartphone which shows a WhatsApp chat featuring Aryan's rap songs. Shivani Agarwal said in the video that her son was in a detention centre and these videos did not feature him. Thus, it is more than clear that the viral clip does not show the teen accused in the Pune Porsche case bragging about the accident."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story This photo is from Barack Obama’s rally in St. Louis, Missouri, in 2008. Former US President Donald Trump held a major campaign rally on February 23 in South Bronx, his first election campaign event in New York City since 2016. Following this, a photo of a huge gathering in an urban area was widely shared on social media, with claims that it shows Trump’s Bronx rally. A Facebook user shared the viral photo , and wrote, “Pretty good crowd for Trump in the Bronx.” India Today Fact Check found that the viral photo is from former US President Barack Obama’s rally in 2008 near the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri. A reverse image search led us to several news reports from October 2008. A report from STLtoday.com , dated October 18, 2008, about former US President Barack Obama’s rally in St. Louis, Missouri, featured the viral photo. It noted that Obama’s rally drew 100,000 people. The report also included several other pictures from the rally. Another news outlet reported on this Obama rally and called it the largest crowd for an Obama event in the US. Similar reports of the Obama campaign in St. Louis containing the viral picture can be seen here and here . Trump’s rally in South Bronx is being seen as an attempt to make inroads with Hispanic and Black voters ahead of the elections scheduled for November. An aerial view of the gathering at Trump’s event can be seen below. Thus, it’s clear that a photo from Obama’s rally in St. Louis from 2008 was falsely shared as a recent Trump rally in New York City."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Bombay High Court said on Friday that the teen accused in the Pune Porsche accident was also in trauma, and he should be given some time. The teen was allegedly driving the Porsche car at very high speed in an intoxicated state on May 19, when the car crashed into a bike, killing two software engineers, Aneesh Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta. He was granted bail the same day by the Juvenile Justice Board and ordered to be put under the care and supervision of his parents and grandfather under one of the conditions that a 300-word essay needed to be written on road safety. The police later filed an application before the board, seeking amendment of the bail order. On May 22, the board ordered the boy to be taken into custody and remanded him to an observation home. The bench of Justices Bharti Dangre and Manjusha Deshpande said this while pointing to the approach of the Pune police in the way the minor was first granted bail and then suddenly, amidst mounting public pressure, was put in an observation home. \"Two people have lost their lives. There was trauma but the child (juvenile) was also in trauma, give him some time,\" the Bombay High Court said, while grilling the prosecution during hearing of a plea filed by the aunt of the teen accused in the Porsche Pune crash. The teen's aunt had filed the plea, seeking his release from the observation home. During the hearing, the bench questioned the police under what provision of law, the order granting bail to the juvenile accused in the Pune Porsche accident case was amended and how he had been kept in confinement. Advocate Aabad Ponda representing the juvenile's aunt, submitted that the police had not challenged the bail order or sought its cancellation but had gone for modification of it, which is illegal. Ponda further that the boy's fundamental rights were violated. \"A free citizen's personal liberty has been trampled upon. Can a child be taken in custody when he has been granted bail and the bail order is in force?\" Ponda said. He added that there was no provision under law where such a review of a bail order can be sought and passed. The bench noted that the bail order was amended after the Pune police moved the application and the boy was taken into custody and has been remanded to an observation home, thrice since then. \"What type of remand is this? Where is the power to remand? What kind of procedure is this where a person has been granted bail and then a remand is passed taking him in custody,\" the court asked. The bench added that the boy was taken away from the care and supervision of his family members and sent to an observation home, \"which is not the aim of the statute\". \"He is a person who has been granted bail, but now he has been confined to an observation home. Is this not confinement? We would like to know your source of power,\" the bench asked chief Public Prosecutor Hiten Venegaonkar, representing the Pune police. The bench questioned why the police did not move an application for cancellation of the bail. Venegaonkar submitted that the remand orders passed by the board were all valid and there has only been a change in guardianship: instead of the parents, he is now under a probation officer. Venegaonkar submitted that on May 19, the bail order of the board, \"rightly or wrongly\" passed but since then much has happened and there was tampering of evidence. \"Action has been taken against the errant officers and doctors. We have taken them to task. A strong message to society has to be sent that you cannot walk out by just writing a 300-word essay. The duty of the state will have to be maintained,\" Venegaonkar said. The teenager is currently in an observation home till June 25. The bench too reserved its order on the aunt's plea and said the order would be passed on June 25."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Pune Sessions Court on Friday granted bail to Vishal Agarwal, the father of the minor involved in a fatal car accident on May 19 that claimed the lives of two software engineers. However, Agarwal will remain in jail due to ongoing legal cases stemming from the incident. Advocate Prashant Patil, who appeared for Vishal Agarwal, was quoted by ANI as saying, \"My client has been granted bail by the Sessions Court in Pune. It is his duty to abide by the conditions imposed by the Court and shall continue to cooperate with the investigation agency.\" The 17-year-old juvenile was allegedly driving a Porsche car at high speed while intoxicated when the vehicle collided with a motorbike, killing techies Aneesh Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta. Agarwal was arrested on May 22 for allowing an unlicensed minor to operate an unregistered vehicle, violating both the Motor Vehicles Act and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act. Advocate Prashant Patil argued that Vishal Agarwal's arrest was unlawful. He contended that the charges against him were non-cognizable offences, meaning police lacked the authority for immediate arrest. Additionally, he argued that authorities should have issued a notice under the Criminal Procedure Code before apprehending Agarwal. Patil further highlighted inconsistencies in the police reports. The FIR for the accident lists the minor as the accused, while the FIR against Agarwal portrays the minor as a victim. The defence argued that this contradictory approach raised serious legal questions. Agarwal's bail petition also claimed the presence of an adult driver in the car at the time of the accident. Despite securing bail in this specific case, Agarwal remains in Yerwada Central Prison due to three other ongoing cases. One case involves alleged kidnapping and wrongful confinement of the family driver, whom the Agarwals are accused of pressuring to take responsibility for driving the car. Another case pertains to potential evidence tampering, with allegations that the minor's blood sample was swapped with his mother's to avoid detection of alcohol. Separate from these cases linked to the May 19 incident, Agarwal faces three older, unrelated cases that his family maintains were revived after the accident. He has received interim protection from arrest in one of these cases but awaits bail in the remaining two."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A Mumbai resident who contested the Lok Sabha polls as an independent has approached the Bombay High Court seeking to declare Shiv Sena leader Ravindra Waikar's win from Mumbai North West as void. Waikar won the election by a slender margin of 48 votes over his Shiv Sena (UBT) opponent Amol Kirtikar. The plea was filed by Goregaon resident Bharat Khimji Shah, who contested the Lok Sabha polls from Mumbai North West. Shah, representing a party called the Hindu Samaj Party, secured 937 votes. Waikar, meanwhile, bagged 4,52,644 votes. Initially, Amol Kirtikar was declared the winner from the seat. However, after recounting of votes, Waikar was declared the winner. In his plea, Shah has sought that the relevant records from the office of election authorities be called, and the legality be checked. The plea also seeks scrutiny of CCTV footage of the polling station on June 4. The plea asks the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the district election officer to conduct a thorough enquiry into the issue raised in an FIR under the court's supervision. The plea also prays that the investigation be completed within 60 days and a report be submitted to the court. The FIR in question was registered based on a complaint that a mobile phone belonging to a data operator at a counting centre was seen in the possession of an aide of Waikar, leading to allegations of EVM manipulation. Mumbai police have registered the FIR and are investigating the case. The plea mentioned that there were several indicators showing that the counting of the votes at the counting centre was not fair. Shah has claimed that despite him raising a complaint, the election officials did not take cognisance. Subsequently, a complaint was registered in the name of tehsildar and Shah was shown as a witness. The plea claimed that when Shah was trying to register a complaint, Waikar was constantly calling police officers."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Bombay High Court said that it was \"startled\" to know that the investigating officer in the case against a Maharashtra bureaucrat's son, Ashwajit Gaikwad, was more interested in filing a claim for damages or compensation before the Motor Accident Claim Tribunal (MACT) than probing the case. The bench of Justices Ajay Gadkari and Neela Gokhale was hearing a plea filed by social media influencer Priya Singh, who was allegedly run over by Gaikwad's vehicle in December last year in Thane. Singh, 26, has claimed that she was in a relationship with Gaikwad. During the hearing, the bench was going through the case diary wherein it was stated that a report was to be sent to the motor tribunal and the accused's Aadhar Card, pass book and other documents were necessary. \"We are unable to accept such a recording in a case diary. According to us, the Investigating Officer, Assistant Police Inspector Vishal Rumane, is investigating a crime and has not been appointed to file a claim for damages or compensation before the MACT. Prima facie, we find that the Investigating Officer is not well conversant with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code,\" said the bench. The bench further noted that despite repeated reminders from the victim, the police did not record her supplementary statements. \"It shakes our conscience after perusing the case diary and record of investigation as the victim in a crime has to plead repeatedly before the Investigating Officer for recording her statement,\" said the bench. The bench noted that on April 22, the Additional Public Prosecutor had submitted before the court that the investigation was in progress and attempts were made to record further statements of the complainant. However, in spite of the submissions made two months ago, the victim was not called for further recording of her statement. The bench also noted that the case diary too was not maintained as it should have been under rules. There are rules for maintaining diaries that the bench led by Justice Gadkari has been directing to maintain. The Joint Commissioner's affidavit has to be filed by June 27 and the bench will again hear the case on June 28."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Bombay High Court has directed the central government and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) to respond to a Mumbai-based journalist's plea for a CBI investigation against NCB Deputy Director General Gyaneshwar Singh, also noting concerns over the treatment of the complainant and the handling of related issues by officials. The court observed that the complainant was being put in the dock and \"cornered from all sides\" by the officials. Taking note of the summons issued to the complainant and a defamation case filed against him by an NCB official, the court stated that the manner in which officials handled the complaint shows \"something amiss\". The journalist had approached the High Court seeking a CBI investigation against Singh, stating that procedures mandated by the law were flouted in the disposal of some drugs. He claimed to have unearthed this information during his reportage. Advocates Niranjan Mundargi and Keral Mehta, appearing for the journalist, pointed out that after his complaint was forwarded to senior NCB officers, the journalist received various summons. \"He appeared in person for one summons while giving a written reply to the other. He is not shying away from his complaints, but how can an officer who is junior to Singh look into this complaint? An Inspector against a DDG?\" asked Mundargi, countering a junior officer of NCB summoning the journalist. He also pointed out that while the journalist's complaints are still pending, an officer named MR Arvind, who works as Superintendent of operations at NCB headquarters under Singh, registered a defamation complaint against the journalist in February 2024, in New Delhi. The journalist has now received a notice, he added. This defamation case was registered under non-cognisable offences, while notices under CrPC 41A are sent only in cognisable offences. The advocate argued that although technically the notice could not have been sent to the journalist, it was issued only as a threat. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Devang Vyas countered this, saying the officer's defamation complaint and the complaint against Singh are not related. He highlighted that both the journalist's complaint and Arvind's complaint were registered in New Delhi and hence beyond the jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court. Vyas also stated that the defamation case was prior to the journalist lodging and receiving summons from the NCB, which was in April 2024. After considering the arguments, the bench of Justices Revati Mohite-Dere and Shyam Chandak said to Mundargi, \"So from all corners, you are being cornered. This appears to be a bona fide apprehension.\" The bench then told the Additional Solicitor General, \"You are putting him in the dock, getting him cornered from all sides. At least that is what it appears.\" Vyas countered by saying, \"What appears is not necessarily true.\" The bench added, \"the manner in which things are moving, there is reason for us to feel that there is something amiss.\" “The officer should have suggested that for transparency's sake, the complaint be sent to another department. Can he be a judge of his own cause? The journalist is not shying away from his complaint. On the contrary, he wants to take it to a logical end. So, he expects a fair enquiry. It has to go to a different department,” the court said. The bench sought an affidavit from Vyas within three weeks and will hear the journalist's petition again after four weeks. The bench said that it would be making further decisions only after examining the affidavit in reply to be filed by the Additional Solicitor General."

The information was confirmed by the singer on his official X handle. In his post, the singer named all the alleged accused. According to Ali, Sindhuri, her husband and her 'political' brother-in-law have used State machinery and money to illegally encroach upon land. pic.twitter.com/GeUF0N9Y4k — Lucky Ali (@luckyali) June 20, 2024 This is not the first time Ali has referred to the alleged land grabbing. In December 2022, he had tagged the Director General of Police, Karnataka in a thread and said that his farm, which is a trust property, was being encroached on illegally by Sudhir Reddy and Madhu Reddy from the Bangalore land mafia with the help of Sindhuri. Notably, Rohini Sindhuri is embroiled in another legal battle with Indian Police Service (IPS) officer D Roopa Moudgil. On February 18 last year, Sindhuri discovered that Moudgil had made several allegations against her in Facebook posts, accusing Sindhuri of sharing her private pictures with fellow IAS officers. This led to a public spat between the two, prompting the state government to transfer both officers. On February 21, Sindhuri issued a legal notice to Moudgil and demanded an unconditional apology and Rs 1 crore in damages for the loss of her reputation and mental agony. On March 24, a Bengaluru court, which was hearing the private suit filed by Sindhuri, ordered initiation of a criminal defamation case against Roopa. Moudgil then moved the High Court to have the same quashed. On August 21, the Karnataka High Court rejected her plea, prompting Moudgil to approach the apex court, where the case is pending."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In a decisive move to curb paper leaks and cheating in public examinations, the government on Friday introduced the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024 . This law comes into force amid a massive controversy surrounding the NEET and UGC-NET exams, which have been marred by allegations of paper leaks and irregularities. The Act aims to prevent unfair means in public examinations conducted by major bodies such as the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), Staff Selection Commission (SSC), railways, banking recruitment examinations, and the National Testing Agency (NTA), among others. Here’s how the new legislation aims to curb malpractice in public exams: Stricter Punishments: The Act prescribes a minimum three-year jail term, extendable to five years, for individuals caught leaking exam papers or tampering with answer sheets. Offenders will also face fines of up to Rs 10 lakh. Non-Bailable Offences: All offences under the Act are classified as cognisable and non-bailable, meaning authorities can arrest individuals without a warrant and they cannot seek bail as a right. Accountability for Service Providers: Examination service providers who possess knowledge of a potential offence but fail to report it can be fined a hefty Rs 1 crore. Targeting Organised Crime: The law takes a harsher stance on organised cheating. Senior officials within service providers who knowingly participate in or facilitate such activities face a minimum three-year sentence, potentially extending to 10 years, along with a Rs 1 crore fine. Examination authorities or service providers involved in organised exam malpractice can be imprisoned for a minimum of five years and a maximum of 10, with the same Rs 1 crore fine. Protections for the Innocent: The Act offers some protection to individuals who can demonstrably prove that the offence was committed without their knowledge and that they tried their best to prevent it. National Eligibility Test (UGC-NET) and the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) – crucial exams for aspiring academics and medical professionals, respectively. NEET, held on May 5 with about 24 lakh candidates, faced allegations of question paper leaks, particularly in Bihar . Additionally, the UGC-NET was cancelled entirely due to suspicions that the integrity of the exam was compromised. Against this backdrop, the NTA announced on Friday the postponement of the June edition of the Joint CSIR-UGC-NET , citing unavoidable circumstances and logistic issues. This test determines eligibility for junior research fellowships, assistant professorships, and PhD admissions in science courses."

The Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Prasanna Kumar provided an update on the ongoing investigation in the gruesome murder of Renukaswamy, who was a fan of acor Darshan. The SPP on Saturday did not request custody of the accused. Instead, all four accused have been remanded to judicial custody. The court has ordered that Darshan, Pradosh, Vinay, and Dhanraj be held at Parappana Agrahara Central Prison. They will remain in judicial custody for 14 days, until the next hearing on July 4. Darshan was arrested on June 11 for his alleged involvement in the murder of 33-year-old Renukaswamy. Renukaswamy, a fan of Darshan, had allegedly sent obscene messages to Darshan's co-star and friend Pavithra Gowda, who was also arrested in the case. The messages angered the actor, who then allegedly engaged his fan club member to execute the murder, as per sources. Sources added that Raghavendra, a member of Darshan's fan club, lured Renukaswamy to a shed in RR Nagar under the pretext of arranging a meeting with the actor. It is here that Renukaswamy was allegedly tortured and killed. Some of the accused in police custody have confessed that Darshan paid Rs 30 lakh to kill Renukaswamy, dispose of the body and destroy evidence. They were also paid off to turn themselves in and take the blame for the murder, as per the investigation report. The autopsy revealed Renukaswamy was brutally attacked with wooden clubs and died \"due to shock and haemorrhage as a result of multiple blunt injuries sustained\". The post-mortem report also indicated Renukaswamy was kicked and suffered a ruptured testicle. According to the autopsy, Renukaswamy was given electric shocks prior to his death. Details of the alleged torture were revealed by an accomplice during questioning after his arrest, as per sources. A total of 17 people are accused in the murder case."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A week after Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde alleged that ‘urban Naxals’ have infiltrated some Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) and are setting up false narratives against his government, a Pune-based organisation sent him a legal notice. The outfit demanded that Shinde disclose the names of such NGOs or apologise publicly. Addressing an event related to the Legislative Council Polls on June 16, Shinde said, \"Naxals are not just in Gadchiroli. Urban Naxals have entered NGOs and have systematically set up false narratives against the government. While not all NGOs are problematic, some are clearly anti-government. They actively spread falsehoods about our (ruling) alliance.\" The notice, sent by one Balkrishna alias Bunty Nidhalkar, who claims to be an active member of the 'Nirbhay Bano' people's movement, stated that as Chief Minister, it is inappropriate for Shinde to drag politics into every issue, especially while the people of Maharashtra are facing crises. Highlighting the farm crisis and rising unemployment among other issues, the notice called Shinde’s claim absurd and illegal, and stated that such claims should not have been made by a Chief Minister. The notice, sent through advocate Asim Sarode, also stated that the Shiv Sena leader’s statement implied that he is aware of various NGOs which, according to him, are urban Naxals. Therefore, it requested him to immediately inform the police about all these NGOs and make a public announcement so that legal action can be taken. It further stated that if there is no truth in Shinde’s statement, then he should publicly apologise to the people of Maharashtra for his \"irresponsible and false statement\". According to the leaders of the Nirbhay Bano movement, they work for the protection of democracy."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Bombay High Court has transferred an investigation into the shooting of a businessman from the local police in Maharashtra’s Baramati to the Crime Investigation Department, noting that officials were trying to assist the accused. The High Court noted that the statement of an injured victim was being \"conveniently disbelieved\" and that \"irrelevant material is considered by the Investigating Officer only to give leverage to the accused.\" The case relates to an incident in May 2021, when the accused Akash More, along with an unknown person on a motorcycle, opened fire at the complainant businessman, Raviraj Taware, while he was with his wife at a market. The bench of Justices Ajay Gadkari and Shyam Chandak, after reviewing the evidence, said \"The bench noted that all the Investigating Officers of the case have disbelieved the statements of the injured witness, which under the law has its own significance. It appears to us that, the Investigating Officer/s with a view of give a clean chit to accused have not investigated the motive behind the crime.\" There is a \"specific allegation of conspiracy thereof and having sufficient material on record to show prima facie involvement of Jaydeep in the crime, the Investigating Officer/s have conveniently overlooked it to protect him from the clutches of law, for the reasons best known to them,” the bench noted. The accused and the victim both belong to the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. Raviraj escaped unhurt in the incident, but the accused threatened him by shouting that Chikoo Patil alias Jaydeep Taware, a former sarpanch, would not spare him. Raviraj’s wife, Rohini Taware, is a Zila Parishad member, and it is alleged that Raviraj, who works as a contractor, used to benefit from her position by securing contracts. The court noted that the motive behind the crime was political and business rivalry arising from monetary losses suffered by the accused, Jaydeep, due to civil contracts allotted by local authorities. The attack was orchestrated to create a reign of terror in the vicinity to gain pecuniary benefits, the court said. The police invoked the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, and Jaydeep was arrested. However, within a fortnight of Jaydeep's arrest, the Investigating Officer filed a report exonerating him from the crime, stating that there was no evidence at all to indict him. Subsequently, the court released Jaydeep on interim bail. Rohini then challenged this move of the Investigating Officer in court. The trial court allowed her protest petition and rejected the Investigating Officer's report, directing him to conduct a detailed investigation based on the statements of the injured and other witnesses and submit a detailed report at the time of filing the charge-sheet. The trial court also directed Jaydeep Taware to surrender. Within 11 days of his arrest, the Investigating Officer again filed an application before the trial court stating that there was no evidence against Jaydeep. However, this application was rejected by the trial court, which directed further investigation. It was this order that Jaydeep Taware challenged before the High Court, where the matter was heard by a bench headed by Justice Gadkari. The High Court's single bench had earlier dismissed Jaydeep’s plea, noting that there is sufficient material against him. Later, the Supreme Court also rejected his plea."

The accused’s counsel submitted that the POCSO case was filed in a fit of rage after an altercation between the accused and the cousin’s father, who also told the court that the case was filed due to a “misunderstanding.” As per the case details, the accused man had been living with his cousin’s family in Mumbai, doing odd jobs for them since his father died in 2017. While he was unemployed, he had requested his relatives in Mumbai to give him some money to rebuild the house in the village. For this, he offered to stay with them and do odd jobs like taking care of their intellectually challenged kids and driving for them, according to the details submitted by advocate Siddhesh Borkar. The family had agreed, and the man had been staying with his relatives for the past few months. The accused, however, alleged that the cousin’s father would beat him up whenever he asked for money. During an altercation between the two in 2023, the accused pushed the cousin's father, leading to a fracture in his hand. Following the injury, the father registered a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act against him. During the bail hearing in the High Court, the cousin’s father also submitted before the bench that the case was registered due to a misunderstanding and, upon reflection, said he has no objection to bail being granted to the accused. Noting that the accused had been behind bars for eight months and the chargesheet had already been filed in the case, the bench of Justice Manish Pitale granted bail. The High Court directed the accused to report at the police station and asked him not to visit the cousin’s house."

Why cannot it be done for everyone else? Citizens are taxpayersâæ they need to have a clear footpath and safe place to walk,” the bench said. Advocate SU Kamdar, appearing for the BMC, said that there are lakhs of hawkers in every ward of the city, and despite civic officials taking action in two shifts and removing the hawkers, they keep coming back. Kamdar further added that the civic authority picks up the material of the hawkers illegally occupying footpaths and roads. \"Earlier we used to fine them when they used to come to collect the material, but now they don't come to collect the material as well,\" submitted Kamdar. The bench pointed out that this was a serious problem where people who raise the issue of illegal hawkers are getting beaten up. Kamdar pointed out that even BMC officials get beaten up while taking action. It is then that the bench came down heavily on the BMC and said, \"At least the footpaths need to be cleared on a daily basis. Why are we protecting the encroachers? You are not taking action.\" While reminding the authority that it was in 2012 that it had told the Supreme Court that it would deal with the issue, the bench said, \"In 12 years it cannot be that you are still saying the same thing. The state has to do something drastic. It cannot be that the authorities are perpetually just wondering what to do and working on it. The state has to do something drastic. There seems to be a lack of will because where there is a will, there is always a way. There is complete lawlessness. The state cannot just say that they keep coming back.\" \"Let there be a combing operation every day. You will have to identify the illegal hawkers who keep coming back. There has to be a solution. We are trying to find a solution, but unless we get all the data, how will we find a solution?\" the bench added. The court posted the matter for further hearing on July 22."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The viral video is about 2 years old from Panama. It has nothing to do with the Iran President’s helicopter crash. Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, and several other officials were found dead in a helicopter crash on May 19 in Iran’s East Azerbaijan province. Now a video of a helicopter crash is going viral on social media. Those sharing this video are saying that it is of Iran's President's helicopter crash. Sharing this video , an X user wrote, “Helicopter crash: Accident or conspiracy... A live video of the CCTV camera surfaced. A viral video on social media purports to be of the helicopter of Iran President Ibrahim Raisi.. in which it is claimed that the pilot could not control the helicopter and 9 people lost their lives in the accident.” Its archive can be seen here . India Today Fact Check found that this video is from Panama and has been online since 2022. Upon reverse-searching the viral clip's keyframes, we found the same video uploaded on YouTube on August 22, 2022. As per the video's title, this helicopter crash incident is from the South American country Panama. This makes it clear that the video is not recent. We searched using keywords and found a video report of 9 News Australia that contains the viral video. As per the video report, this incident happened in Panama's jungles in August 2022. There were 6 people on board the helicopter at the time of the crash, including a Panama politician, Dmitri Flores. They were all rescued alive but suffered injuries. We also found several media reports published in August 2022 on this incident. As per reports, after the helicopter crash in the jungle, Dmitri Flores posted a video on social media in which he was seen asking for help from the authorities. Thus, it’s more than clear that a 2-year-old video from Panama is being falsely shared as Ibrahim Rasi's helicopter crash."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The child in the video is Muslim and his name is Ayaz Pathan. He was kidnapped and tortured by dacoits before being rescued by the police in Pakistan. A video of a crying child hanging by a chain tied around their neck has been widely shared with the claim that it showed the Pakistani army torturing Hindus. An Instagram user shared the video with the caption, “Pakistani army is torturing Pakistani Hindu kids by tying them to iron chains and hanging them in the sun while the child cry in pain. People who shout about Islamophobia will never call put rampant Hinduphobia in Islam and Muslim communities. I have tears watching him cry like this.” Its archive can be seen here . India Today Fact Check found that neither is the child seen in this video Hindu nor was he tortured by the Pakistan army. The clip shows a Muslim child named Ayaz Pathan, who was kidnapped and tortured by dacoits. The police have since rescued him. Using a keyword search, we found a report in ARY News that featured a screenshot from the viral video. It said that the child in the video was Ayaz Pathan, who was kidnapped by dacoits Farid Mirani and Yakub Mirani. Twenty-six days after his abduction, the police reportedly rescued him. Multiple news outlets reported this incident and all of them said the name of the child was Ayaz Pathan. After Ayaz’s abduction, many Pathans in Pakistan protested, alleging that the police were not making enough efforts to find him. A video report related to one such protest can be seen below. Ayaz’s father Noorullah Khan told the Independent Urdu that when this happened, he was praying inside his home and his son was playing outside. All of a sudden, two armed men came and took his son away. In the evening, the kidnappers called him, threatening him that if he wanted his son alive, he had to pay a Rs 50 lakh ransom. Per the report , the police registered an FIR on April 14. The report also said that Noorullah Khan originally hails from Quetta, but during the winter season, he moves to Kandhkot with his family for six months. He has three sons and one daughter. Some news reports also published images of Ayaz after the police rescued him. We sent the viral video to Bashir Ahmed Brohi, the SSP of Pakistan’s Kashmore district. He told India Today Fact Check: “The child who was abducted in this incident is Muslim. He was recovered by the police.” Islamabad-based journalist Sajid Mir also corroborated this. Thus, it’s clear that the viral claim is false."

The seventh and last phase of voting in the ongoing Lok Sabha Election is to take place on June 1. In this phase, a total of 57 constituencies including all 13 seats of Punjab will go to polls. As Punjab prepares to vote, two infographics purporting to show exit polls conducted by India Today are being widely shared on social media. These alleged exit polls project a lead for the Bharatiya Janata Party in the Amritsar and Hoshiarpur Lok Sabha seats. The viral infographic projects 31 per cent votes to the BJP, 29 per cent to the Aam Aadmi Party, 21 per cent to the Congress, and 12 per cent to the Shiromani Akali Dal in Hoshiarpur. Whereas in Amritsar, the vote shares projected to these parties were 33 per cent, 25 per cent, 28 per cent, and 10 per cent respectively. Both infographics featured India Today’s logo. While sharing the alleged Amritsar exit poll projections , a Facebook user wrote, “Great news BJP winner Amritsar exit poll, Check voting percentage.” Both infographics are fake. India Today has not released its exit poll yet. Actual exit poll figures will be broadcast only after 6.30 pm on June 1. It’s noteworthy that the Election Commission of India has restricted the broadcast of any exit poll data between 7 am on April 19 and 6.30 pm on June 1.

India Today’s exit polls also do not predict vote share for particular Lok Sabha seats. These projections are always presented according to states and as a whole across the nation. In February 2024, India Today’s Mood Of The Nation survey predicted five seats each for the Congress and the AAP in Punjab. Whereas, it predicted two seats for the BJP and one seat for the SAD in the state. In Amritsar , Congress’ sitting MP Gurjeet Singh Aujla is in a fight with BJP’s Taranjit Singh Sandhu and AAP’s Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal. In Hoshiarpur , BJP’s sitting MP Anita Som Parkash is eyeing a hat-trick as she competes with Congress’ Yamini Gomar and AAP’s Dr Raj Kumar Chabbewal. Thus, it’s more than clear that the viral infographics are fake."

In the full video, he said that he doesn’t believe in the exit poll projections and that the INDIA bloc will form the government. Did Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar say that the INDIA bloc will not form the government after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections? Just a day before the Lok Sabha election results, a video featuring Shivakumar was widely shared with this claim. In the seven-second-long clip, Shivakumar can be heard saying, “I don’t believe we will have, INDIA will form the government.” An X user sharing the viral clip wrote, “And they accept Defeat, DK Shivakumar says INDI is not forming the Government.” Its archive can be seen here . The viral clip was also shared on Facebook with a similar claim. India Today Fact Check found that the viral video is clipped. DK Shivakumar had said that he did not believe in the exit poll projections and that the INDIA bloc would form the government. A reverse search of keyframes from the viral clip led us to a post on X by news agency ANI. On June 3, ANI shared a 14-second-long clip of DK Shivakumar’s byte. In this clip, a reporter asked about the Congress’ prediction of the election results, to which Shivakumar replied, “All seven seats we will.” However, it was unclear which state the reporter and Shivakumar were referring to. After this, the reporter asked, “What is the reaction at this exit poll?” To this, Shivakumar said, “I don’t believe. we will have, INDIA will form the government.” #WATCH | Karnataka Dy CM DK Shivakumar says, \"...INDIA (alliance) will form the govt\" pic.twitter.com/uSV36zSYdO — ANI (@ANI) June 3, 2024 After the seventh and last phase on June 1, various news channels presented their exit poll data that predicted a clear majority for the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance. However, the Congress party and other members of the INDIA bloc have claimed that the exit polls will be proven wrong on June 4, the counting day. It is thus clear that DK Shivakumar’s clipped video is being shared with misleading context."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story This is a fake article on a fake BBC website. Nowhere did Samson promote a trading app during the interview. A sensational article being widely shared on social media claims that during the live broadcast of the talk show \"I AM with Dhanya Varma\", the namesake host called cricketer Sanju Samson a liar in front of thousands of viewers. The article published on a website that resembles the BBC, with former BBC journalist Jane Wakefield’s byline, also calimed that Samson endorsed the trading platform “Immediate 9.1 Alrex” on the talk show, adding that after the cricketer signed up the host to this platform and deposited Rs 26,000, which grew to Rs 31,094 in only 30 minutes. A Facebook user shared this report with the caption, “A hard day for India: We say goodbye to Sanju Samson”. India Today Fact Check found that this article is fake. Sanju Samson didn’t promote any such trading platform on Dhanya Varma’s talk show. Jane Wakefield too confirmed that she had not written this article. The first thing we noticed was that the URL of the viral website pretending to be the BBC was not bbc.com but undernwmeo.com/X9Jpjj . Also searching for the headline “I AM management refuses to comment on the scandal surrounding its show I AM with Dhanya Varma” did not yield any BBC reports. None of the categories on the fake websites — “Home”, “War in Ukraine”, “Climate”, “Video”, “World” — were clickable. They appeared to be setdressing to make the website resemble the BBC. All the hyperlinks in the site lead to a new web page where you are asked to enter details like name, email address, and phone number. This made it clear this was a phishing scam. We entered dummy information here and received the pop-up message: “Make sure to wait for an operator to call you, they will call you in less than 10 minutes”. Following this message, our browser flashed a warning that certain attackers might be trying to steal information, like passwords or credit card details. (Paste: GIF 2 here) The images of Sanju Samson and Dhanya Varma used in the viral reports have been taken from the videos of a talk show “I am with Dhanya Varma”. Sanju’s three-part interview was uploaded on the official YouTube channel of this show in November 2023. They spoke in English and Malayam. At no point in the interview did the cricketer or the interviewer mention any trading platform. Next, we contacted Dhanya Varma. She told India Today Fact Check that the article was completely baseless. She also added that no such conversation happened with Sanju, before, during, or after the recording of the show. We also reached out to the former BBC journalist Jane Wakefield and asked her about the viral article with her byline. She told us that she did not write this article and denied ever interviewing Sanju Samson. Notably, similar fake articles with Jane’s byline have made the rounds on social media before as well. India Today debunked one such article that you can read here ."

Please go back to portrait mode for the best experience They brought them to the school ground, lined them up, tied their hands and started raining bullets on them indiscriminately. They didn't stop at that. The barbarians poured kerosene on the dying men and set them on fire. If anyone moved even slightly, they shot him again and stabbed him with the bayonet. It was May 26, 1971 when the Pakistan Army gunned down as many as 94 Hindus at Burunga High School in the nondescript and quiet Burunga village in Burunga Union of Balaganj upazilla of Sylhet district in Bangladesh. It all started when fears became pronounced that Pakistani forces could target the place any time, triggering panic all across the village. This was in the third week of May 1971, as Bangladesh’s war of Independence was raging. Terrified Burunga villagers met Burunga Union Chairman Injad Ali. On May 25 afternoon, Injad Ali and Cheif of the Union Peace Committee Soyef Uddin Master made an announcement in Burunga and nearby villages that a Peace Committee would be formed in Burunga High School the next day (May 26). They said Peace Committee identity cards would be distributed to the villagers. Everyone was given the assurance that the Pakistani forces would not harass or torture those who have the identity card of the Peace Committee and the villagers would be able to move freely. Believing the assurances of Razakar and members of the Peace Committee, the villagers -- both Hindus and Muslims -- attended the committee meeting at Burunga High School on May 26 morning. More than 1,000 people gathered at the school around 8 am. The Peace Committee started making a list of the villagers. Around 9 am, a large group of Pakistani forces arrived at the school ground, accompanied by Abdul Ahad Chowdhury, the commander of Razakar of Karansi village, and Abdul Khalek, a village doctor. The Pakistan Armymen took the list from the members of the local Peace Committee. A group of Pakistani forces checked every house in the village and forced the remaining men, who did not come to the Peace Committee meeting, to come to the ground in front of the school. It was 9am. Thousands of people were present at the school, with fear still writ on their faces. In the meantime, the local Razakars, Pakistan Army and members of the Peace Committee separated the Hindus and Muslims by checking the list. Hindus were taken to the office room of the school, while Muslims to a classroom. Both the Hindu and Muslim groups were taught the Kalima and asked to sing Pakistan's national anthem. Around 9.30am, an invading army, with Abdul Ahad Chowdhury, ordered everyone to deposit all the money they had as well as gold jewellery. After extorting money and gold from everyone, most of the Muslims were released. The Pakistan armymen asked 10-12 of the Muslims to bring nylon rope from the local market. After they brought the ropes, the Hindus were asked to knot them together tightly. Some Hindus in the room started screaming. Pritiranjan Chowdhury, a teacher of the school, who survived the massacre, said, \"Even though I was supposed to go to the school around 8 am on May 26, I got a little late. When I reached there, I saw all the Hindus were locked in an office room. Seeing me, they caught me and took me to the office room. A window in the room was a little broken. I thought that if I had to survive, I would have to escape from the clutches of these men. So, I somehow opened the window and jumped out of it. Ranu Malakar and some others also managed to escape after me.\" Those who could not were lined up in the school ground after their hands were tied by the invading soldiers. Then they started firing. Shri Nivas Chakraborty, another survivor who was shot twice in the Burunga massacre, said, \"Bullets from machinegun were fired at the helpless people with their hands tied at the back. There was blood everywhere. But it did not end there. To ensure everyone was dead, they set them on fire. As soon as a gunshot hit my left hand, I feigned that I was dead and lay still on the ground.\" \"When the armymen left after the firing, some wounded men stood up. Seeing this, the Pakistani forces came back and started firing again. I got shot in the back as well. Luckily, the bullet grazed my skin. I survived. After some time, I heard the voices of local people. Some of them came running. At that time, I noticed that some of the wounded were crying for water. Seeing water in a bucket in the school yard, my elderly father Nikunj Bihari Chakraborty, who was himself injured, and a few others mustered courage and helped the wounded drink water. I lost my father and brother Nittaranjan Chakraborty in the massacre,” he added. After unleashing violence, the Pakistani forces and the Razakars asked Sylhet court lawyer Ram Ranjan Bhattacharya to leave. As soon as the sick Ram Ranjan stood up from his chair, the marauders shot him dead. Later, the Razakars, led by Ahad Chowdhury and village doctor Abdul Khalek, ransacked and looted the entire village, while setting fire to all the houses there… Reporter: Sahidul Hasan Khokon Edited by: Tirtho Banerjee Interactive Producer: Raka Mukherjee Interactive Developer: Vishal Rathour Photo Researcher: Raman Pruthi Cover Illustration: Vani Gupta"

Please go back to portrait mode for the best experience It was 4 PM and the sun was still beating down as Ershad Ali frantically searched for his father Chikon Ali among the hundreds of bodies piled up in Patkhola water body near the present-day Chuknagar College. Suddenly, his eyes fell on a small child -- a girl -- trying to feed from her dead mother's breasts, who lay there lifeless after the firing. The child’s clothes were soaked in blood. Ershad Ali took up the girl in his arms and brought her home. He named her 'Sundari' as he had seen vermilion on her mother's hair parting and also shaankha (white bangle made from conch shell) on her hands. A local Hindu family raised her. Another survivor of the shooting, Surendranath Bairagi, saw people preparing their food. All of a sudden, sound of gunshots rang through the small town. People ran helter-skelter, scurrying for cover. Bairagi scampered towards the river, where many bodies lay scattered. When he emerged safe after the shooting, Bairagi found all his brothers dead. In just a few hours on May 20, 1971, around 10,000 refugees desperately trying to cross over to India were mowed down by Pakistan Army's merciless automatic firing at Bangladesh's Chuknagar in Khulna bordering West Bengal. Pakistan's genocidal campaign during Bangladesh's Liberation War has few parallels in post-colonial history. Since the outset of the genocide targeting Bengalis -- Hindus and freedom-loving Muslims alike -- the Pakistan Army resorted to mass massacre to create a reign of terror that would scare Bengalis to submission. The Chuknagar massacre was one of the many such incidents of mass killing as part of General Tikka Khan's 'Operation Searchlight'. On March 25, 1971, thousands of panic-stricken Bengalis rushed towards the Indian border via Khulna from places like Barisal, Bagerhat, and Faridpur. After a tediously long journey, worsened by hunger and fear, they converged on Chuknagar and adjacent areas by crossing the Bhadra River to take respite for a few days. Ghulam Hossain, then chairman of Atlia Union, reported this sudden influx to a Pakistani military platoon in Satkhira. Troops rushed to Chuknagar at frenzied speed, divided into three units. One headed for Malopara-Raipara, the second for the Chuknagar bazaar, and another for the Bhadra river bank. What followed was the largest and most brutal pogrom. The indiscriminate firing from three sides caught the hordes of refugees unawares and defenceless. Men, women and children were gunned down and their efforts to hide in boats, behind trees or in the fields went in vain. From the marshy areas in Chuknagar to temples, playgrounds, school premises and rivers, lifeless bodies lay strewn everywhere. Bhadra River turned red with the blood of thousands. After a local Hindu family took over her responsibility, Sundari grew up in a liberated Bangladesh. In 1984, she got married to Batul Sarkar of the same area. She lost her husband in 1990 and now stays with her sons. Sundari lives in a tin-shed house, which was allotted to her under a government housing project, on the banks of Kanthaltala River in Dumuria upazila. She is also working as an office assistant at Dumuria Upazila Shilpakala Academy. Sundari said that before this, she had received 11 satak (around 4,500 square feet) khas land (government land). But as there was a water body, she could not fill it with soil due to financial constraints. She said, \"Every May 20, I go to Chuknagar slaughterhouse in whose vicinity there’s a memorial that was built by the government to pay homage to those who died in the firing. It’s a tomb (like many others) that keeps reminding Bengalis the high cost they paid for freedom.” Sundari added, “While visiting the slaughterhouse, I am always overwhelmed with emotions. I want to know my identity; I want to know the names of my parents.\" One of the witnesses of the massacre, Fazlur Rahman Morol, the caretaker of the Chuknagar slaughterhouse, said, \"After the massacre, many bodies floated on the river. That's why it was not possible to ascertain the actual number of martyrs.” Especially, the identities of relatives of those who came from Barisal, Faridpur, Bagerhat Sadar, Rampal of Bagerhat, Morelganj, Kachua, Sharankhola areas couldn't be established. ABM Shafiqul Islam, president of Chuknagar Genocide 1971 Memory Preservation Council, said that on that day, the massacre took place in an area spread over four miles of Chuknagar. \"After the massacre, the local people immersed some bodies in the Gangrail and Bhadra rivers. They did not consume fish from those water bodies for two months. Some bodies were buried in the ground to avoid stench. Human bones were found during the establishment of Chuknagar College,\" Islam revealed. Sheikh Baharul Alam, a member of the trustee board of Khulna's 'Liberation War Archive Museum', pointed out that the Razakar Army was formed under the leadership of Jamaat's AKM Yusuf in this region 15 days before the beginning of the war. And this allied force of Pakistan Army assaulted around 10,000 locals. Baharul said, \"In the most brutal massacre of 1971 in Chuknagar, the exact number of martyrs is still unknown, but 10,000 to 12,000 innocent, unarmed Bengalis were killed.\" Local journalists revealed that in recorded human history, there's no other incident where such a large number of people were killed in such a short time. Shahriar Kabir, an eminent genocide researcher, underlined that in 51 years since Bangladesh's Independence, around 3,500 mass graves have been identified. “Such a huge number of graves clearly speak of human casualties at the hands of Pakistan Army. Serious effort from all quarters is required to conduct further investigation in search of such unidentified graves,” said Professor Mamun, who is also a teacher at Dhaka University. During successive regimes led by Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and their iron brother Jamaat-e-Islami, a party of war criminals, efforts to uphold liberation war values have been thwarted and war criminals glorified. Since the assassination of country’s founding father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country has been ruled for 30 years under military dictators and BNP-Jamaat alliance. In all those years, efforts had been made to erase testaments to the world’s worst genocide campaign."

    "article_content": "We don't support landscape mode yet. Please go back to portrait mode for the best experience ‘When I remember the massacre, I still shudder with fear. It was like a procession of corpses that day. Bodies all around, bodies on top of bodies, bodies lying in the canal for 2-3 days. Those who were still in the garden were caught and killed.' This is how eyewitness Bhanu Hazra described the scene that unfolded after the massacre by Pakistani forces in the rented tea garden of Srimangal Upazila of Moulvibazar on May 1, 1971. Bhanu Hazra said he was about 20 years old during the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. His father, Mongu Hazra, was martyred by Pakistani forces just 2-3 days before the Bharaura massacre. Mongu Hazra guided the Indian Army personnel to Sherpur in Moulvibazar. There, Mongu Hazra was martyred by Pakistani soldiers during the firing from both sides. He was buried next to the house that day. Bhanu also said, 'We were hearing gunshots from the garden. Only 7-8 people could survive. Hearing the gunshots, everyone left the garden. It happened around 10-11 am.' After the Pakistani troops left, Bhanu Hazra went to the scene and saw a pile of bodies in the canal. On that day, the soil of the Shakhamura chara (canal) adjacent to the branch of the tea garden got red with the blood of 47 tea workers. According to some, this number is 53. Bhanu Hazra then moved to India with her mother and brothers. During the liberation war there, mother Sanchari Hazra and brother Mana Hazra were martyred by the cannon fire of Pakistani forces in Kamalpur. Another witness, son-in-law Lalchan Hazra (75), sister of the injured Kedarlal Hazra of the south line of the tea garden, said, 'I was in the garden that day. I was looking at them (Pakistani troops). Fire was erupting at the far labour line. Meanwhile, I saw two people firing. I saw Kalachan, Nakla Hazra and three people firing near the river. I hid under a banyan tree in Charabari and watched them. I saw people gathering.' He also said, 'After that, I heard the sound of the firing. Many of my relatives died that day. I left the garden after this incident.' Seven people, including Ramesh Hazra, Golapchan Hazra, Karma Hazra, Depua Hazra, and Kedarlal Hazra, survived the heap of dead bodies that day. Some of them were shot, some were not. He fell on the ground before the shot. But none of them is alive today. A blue monument stands on the side of the Srimangal-Bharaura road in 'Bhadhya Bhoomi' of Bharaura tea garden. It is surrounded by walls about 3 feet high. But there is no immediate sense that it is a slaughterhouse. Painting and cleaning work can be seen there. Kalighat union chairman Pranesh Goala is supervising the spot. UP Chairman Pranesh Goala said, 'In 1996, the construction of the pillar started at the initiative of Kalighat Union Parishad. Every year I paint and clean on my own responsibility.' Quoting the freedom fighters, he said, 'From April 30, 1971, the Pakistani invading forces carried out massacres in Srimangal until December 5. Many men and women, including freedom fighters, were killed by them. He said that after Bangabandhu's historic speech on March 7, 1971, the non-cooperation movement intensified in Srimangal. There was a stalemate in Srimangal's tea industry, including offices and courts. Pakistani forces shot and killed 47 tea workers in a slaughterhouse in the Bharaura tea garden area. The memorial of the martyred freedom fighters on the college road of Bharaura Tea garden is standing proudly, bearing its testimony even today.

    "article_content": "We don't support landscape mode yet. Please go back to portrait mode for the best experience Nijhu Kumar Agarwal stands like the last of the Mohicans to tell the stories of his people to mankind. Fifty years back, he along with the men and women of this community were deceived by the Pakistan Army into believing that they would be sent back to their motherland India through a train and spared a genocide unleashed on Bengalis. The group of Marwari people with some Bengalis, numbered around 450, caught a glimmer of hope thinking that their ordeal under the government of Pakistan on their eastern wing (then East Pakistan and now Bangladesh) was coming to an end. As announced on loudspeakers that they had to board the last train back home to India, they got on it past midnight from Saidpur in Nilphamari, where they had settled for business over the years. The train, believed to be heading for Jalpaiguri in West Bengal through the Chilahati border, rolled on slowly and came to a halt near railway culvert No. 338 in the Golahat area, only two kilometers away from where they had started. All the compartments were shut from the outside. Peeping through a hole, they could see Muslim Biharis, equipped with weapons, and Pakistan armymen, who would soon butcher them to death. All hell broke loose as women, who had been put in a separate compartment, were whisked outside the train and the captors swooped on them like a pack of wolves. The fear ran so deep that none could utter a single word. Men, who pleaded to be shot immediately instead of being hacked, were stabbed indiscriminately. Their request was reciprocated with hostile words from the occupation army that “Pakistan’s bullets were not so cheap to be wasted” on them. There was dense darkness and the bodies lay strewn along the railway track. Only eight to 10 boys managed to run to safety as they were able to dodge the bullets. Today, Nijhu Kumar Agarwal, one of the survivors of his community, is a picture of despair. He points to the spot where his people were massacred. Before that night of June 6 in 1971, hundreds of men from the Marwari community had been picked up by the Pakistan Army to construct an airport. They were forced to toil day in and day out. The genocide, orchestrated and masterminded by Pakistan, began on the night of March 25, 1971. The horror grew and the deception strategy, employed by the Pakistan Army to kill them, worked as planned. This incident is one of the countless ones where the racial hatred against Hindus and Bengalis was unleashed. Three million people were killed and 200,000 to 300,000 women were violated in the most diabolic ethnic cleansing since the days of the Holocaust. The Pakistan Army, however, is still in a state of denial, rejecting all the claims about the genocide, now recognised by the US Lemkin Institute. The outgoing Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa even had the audacity to say that it was a political failure that seceded Bangladesh from Pakistan and not a military failure. But, the tearful eyes of the survivors speak volumes about the pogrom, with muted sighs."

Please go back to portrait mode for the best experience Queen Elizabeth visited India in 1961, 1983 and 1997, but the first visit, which came near 15 years after India’s independence, was the most spectacular Thirteen years after Mahatma Gandhi's death, Queen Elizabeth stood outside the spot of his cremation and took off her sandals. Her husband and Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, who was behind her, did the same. They replaced the footwear they were wearing with red velvet slippers before entering the memorial area. This was the first royal visit of Queen Elizabeth II to India. The then Indian President Rajendra Prasad, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Vice-President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan had earlier received the royal couple at the Delhi airport. Inside, the Queen would pay respect to the astute man who had fought her nation with non-violence. The Queen was the first British monarch to visit India in fifty years. Her grandfather King George V and Queen Mary had visited in 1911, decades before India got Independence. Elizabeth II had ascended the throne on February 6, 1952, after the death of her father King George VI. The stay in the subcontinent, during which they'd also make visits to neighbouring Pakistan and Nepal, was a long one and would last more than a month. Everywhere the Queen went, thousands of people thronged the streets to get a glimpse. In Delhi’s Rajpath, the Queen attended as guest-of-honour the Republic Day parade, which showcased India's fledgling military might. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru also hosted an event at Ramlila Maidan to welcome the Queen, where she gave a speech in which she thanked India for the warm welcome. During the event, the Delhi Corporation gifted the queen a two-feet long model of the Qutub Minar made of elephant tusk. The Duke received a silver candelabra. The Queen inaugurated the institute buildings of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences on January 27, where she also planted a sapling in the premises. Before the Republic Day parade, the Queen and the Duke had visited Jaipur, where, as anticipated, they had got a royal welcome. The Queen even rode on an elephant with the then Maharaja of Jaipur Sawai Man Singh II in the courtyard of the Maharaja’s palace. Soon after the Republic Day, the Queen left for Agra, where she used an open car to drive to Taj Mahal while waving to the thousands who had gathered on pavements to welcome her. The royals also visited Udaipur where the host was welcomed by the Maharana Bhagwat Singh Mewar, who introduced her to more than 50 nobles who had joined him in welcoming the royal couple. The Queen would then head to Karachi in Pakistan. President Ayub Khan in the uniform of Field Marshal drove with the Queen in an open car. The royals visited the Khyber Pass on Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan. After spending a fortnight in Pakistan, the Queen returned to India and visited the Durgapur Steel Plant, which was set up just a few years earlier with the help of the UK. The Queen met the workers in the steel plant before heading to Calcutta. The city provided the biggest welcome of the tour with people crowding the route from the airport to the governor's residence the Raj Bhavan, which was the palace of the Viceroy before India's capital was moved to Delhi in December, 1911. During her stay in the city, the royal couple visited the Victoria Memorial built by Lord Curzon when he was the Viceroy from 1899 to 1905. Both the Queen and her husband were the great-great grandchildren of Queen Victoria, so for the both the site had a strong family interest. Horse racing organisation founded in 1847, The Royal Calcutta Turf Club, organised a race to felicitate the Queen. The prize money for the race was Rs 30,000. The Queen presented the cup to the owner of the winning horse, a wife of a local businessman. After Calcutta, the royal guests reached Bangalore in southern India, where the Maharaja of Mysore and the Mayor of Bangalore welcomed the Queen and the Duke. The Bible Society of India, with its headquarters in Bangalore, was celebrating its 100th anniversary and felicitated the Queen with a Bible translated in Hindi. The Queen planted a sampling at the botanical garden Lal Bagh to commemorate her visit. Bangalore had timed the horticultural show for the Queen's trip. After Bangalore, the royal couple in the last leg of the tour went to Bombay and then to Banaras, where the Queen took a boat ride on the Ganges along the ghats flocked with hundreds of people who had come to watch her. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip made three visits to India – in 1961, 1983 and 1997. In the 1983 visit, the Queen met the then Prime Minister India Gandhi and also presented Mother Teresa with an honorary Order of Merit. In 1997, the Queen’s visit was timed to mark India’s celebration of 50 years of Independence. Creative Director: Rahul Gupta"

    "article_content": "We don't support landscape mode yet. Please go back to portrait mode for the best experience 'Ayodhya ki taiyaari hai, Kashi Mathura baaki hai.' The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) raised the issues of Gyanvapi mosque and Mathura’s Krishna Janmabhoomi-Shahi Idgah Masjid as part of the ‘Ram Mandir Andolan’ in the 1980s. The claim is that the three mosques were built after demolishing Hindu temples. The current ruling party in Uttar Pradesh, BJP, even had a slogan to reclaim them after the court verdict in Babri Masjid and Ram-Janmabhoomi case: 'Ayodhya ki taiyaari hai, Kashi Mathura baaki hai,’ (The preparation is on for Ayodhya, Kashi and Mathura are remaining.) Gyanvapi, pronounced 'gyaan-vaapi', is Sanskrit for 'well of knowledge'. The name given to a mosque in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh has been dragged into the limelight in recent times for a dispute over its religious status. The point of contention is not the mosque itself but what came before the mosque. The mosque, which stands next to the famous Kashi Vishwanath temple situated on the western banks of River Ganga, is allegedly built on the site of a Vishweshwara temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple was built, destroyed and re-built several times between 1194 and 1777. In his book 'Banaras Region: A Spiritual and Cultural Guide', Rana PB Singh, the former professor of cultural geography and heritage studies at Banaras Hindu University (BHU), writes that it is accepted that the first destruction took place in 1194 on the order of Qutb ud-Din Aibak, including the demolition of the temple of Vishweshwara. Some scholars put the most recent one being built in the 16th century under Akbar's reign by two people: Todar Mal, Akbar's finance minister, and Narayana Bhatta, the head of Kashi's predominant Brahmin family. One report mentions that the Vishweshwara temple was built under the name of Moksha Lakshmi Vilasa temple with detailed architectural plans dating back to 1585. This temple was demolished by the order of Aurangzeb in 1669 and converted into a mosque. Historian Audrey Truschke, assistant professor of South Asian history at Rutgers University, wrote in her book 'Aurangzeb: The Man and the Myth': “My understanding is that the Gyanvapi Masjid was indeed built during Aurangzeb’s reign. The masjid incorporates the old Vishwanath temple structure — destroyed on Aurangzeb’s orders — as its qibla (direction towards the Kaaba in Mecca) wall. While the mosque dates back to Aurangzeb’s period, we do not know who built it.\" About a century later, Ahilyabai Holkar, the queen of Indore, built the new (and present) Kashi Vishwanath temple near the Gyanvapi Mosque. The modern-day temple and mosque are next to each other but have different entry and exit points. // <![CDATA[ (function (d) { var js, id = \"genially-embed-js\", ref = d.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) { return; } js = d.createElement(\"script\"); js.id = id; js.async = true; js.src = \"https://view.genial.ly/static/embed/embed.js\"; ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref); }(document)); // ]]> The demand around the Gyanvapi mosque-Shringar Gauri complex and Mathura’s Krishanjanma Bhoomi-Shahi Idgah Masjid was raised in the 1980's during the Ram Mandir Andolan. The recent dispute about the existence of the temple at the Gyanvapi mosque, however, amplified on May 16, when the ASI survey was completed. News spread that a purported ‘Shivling’ had been found inside the masjid compound, and chants of ‘Baba mil gaye’ came to fill the streets outside Gyanvapi mosque. Advocate Sudheer Tripathi, who represents the petitioners who requested permission to pray in other parts of the complex in August last year, had claimed that if a Shivling was found in 2022, it meant the Shivling was there back in 1947 as well. The wazookhana, a structure for ablutions in which the purported Shivling has now been found, was accepted as a property of the mosque in 1937. Advocate Abhay Yadav, who represents Anjuman Intezamiya Masajid (AIM) in the Varanasi court, was present during the finding of the purported Shivling. He has claimed that the structure found was a 'a fountain, not a Shivling'. The Shivling-like structure found inside the Gyanvapi mosque has a striking similarity with the one from Gutpa period found near Varanasi, said historian Shri Bhagwan Singh, who has a PhD from Banaras Hindu University and specialises in idol worship and ancient Indian history. The finding of the purported Shivling led to the Supreme Court directing the District Magistrate of Varanasi to ensure protection of the said area inside the Gyanvapi-Shringar Gauri complex. However, the court also directed that \"this must be done without affecting the right of Muslims to offer prayer at the mosque\". According to Hindu mythology, Kansa, the ruler of the Vrishni kingdom, had imprisoned his sister Devaki and brother-in-law Vasudeva in Mathura because he feared a prophecy that their eighth son would kill him. So, Kansa murdered Devaki’s six children before the seventh and eighth children – Balarama and Krishna - were born. Krishna was born in a jail in Mathura but his father Vasudeva took him to Gokul to protect him from Kansa. Krishna was raised as the son of Yashoda and Nanda in Gokul. The birthplace of Lord Krishna in Mathura is known as the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi and the area of the 'janmasthan' is called Katra Keshav Dev. The spot currently has a temple complex. Next to the temple complex is Shahi Idgah Mosque. The Hindus argue that Mughal ruler Aurangzeb destroyed part of a temple in the 16th century to build a mosque. A petition filed in 2020 by the Hindu side stated: “That it is matter of fact and history that Aurangzeb ruled over the country from 31.07.1658 to 3.03.1707 AD and he being staunch follower of Islam had issued orders for demolition of large number of Hindu religious places and temples including the temple standing at the birth place of Lord Shree Krishna at Katra Keshav Dev, Mathura in the year 1669-70 AD. The army of Aurangzeb partly succeeded to demolish Keshav Dev Temple and a construction was forcibly raised showing the might of power and said construction was named as Idgah Mosque.” The petition also claimed the mosque was removed and the temple was restored after the Marathas defeated the Mughals and drove them out in 1770. But in 1803, the British defeated the Marathas. The 13.37 acres of land was auctioned by the East India Company in 1815. The plot was sold to Raja Patni Maal of Benaras. Raja Patni Maal's legal heirs sold the land to Hindu Mahasabha members Madan Mohan Malviya, Goswami Ganesh Dutt and Bhikhen Lalji Aattrey in 1944 for Rs 13,400 even as the Muslims contested claim to parts of the land. The money was paid by Jugal Kishore Birla, who set up the Shree Krishna Janmabhoomi Trust. According to the plaint, the deed for the land was transferred to the trust so that a temple could be built. But the trust could not achieve its objective and became defunct in 1958. Subsequently, the Shree Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sangh was formed, which was later renamed the Shree Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan, to manage the trust land. The Muslim side had continued to seek parts of the land through litigation during this period. And eventually, in 1968, a settlement was reached in which the Sangh conceded the 2.37 acre of land on which the mosque was built. // <![CDATA[ (function (d) { var js, id = \"genially-embed-js\", ref = d.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) { return; } js = d.createElement(\"script\"); js.id = id; js.async = true; js.src = \"https://view.genial.ly/static/embed/embed.js\"; ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref); }(document)); // ]]> Even as the Gyanvapi mosque case continues in the court, a fresh petition has revived the debate on Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi-Shahi Idgah Mosque issue. The Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Trust and other private parties have filed the petition seeking removal of the 16th century mosque, while claiming ownership of the land on which the mosque is built. The mosque is adjacent to the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi, which is considered to be the birthplace of Lord Krishna. This is not the first time such a petition has been filed. In fact, near a dozen such petitions have been filed in the past couple of years but until now, courts had largely stayed away from entertaining such petitions, saying they were in violation of the Places of Worship Act of 1991. The Places of Worship Act maintains the religious status of any place of worship as it was on August 15, 1947. The origin of this case took place in 2020 when an advocate - Ranjana Agnihotri - along with six others filed a claim in the court of a civil judge. Agnihotri had filed the lead petition as the “next friend” of Bhagwan Shri Krishna Viraajman. The petition had claimed that a settlement made in 1968 on the issue had been achieved “through fraud”. The petition discounted the settlement between the temple management authority Shri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan and Shahi Masjid Eidgah, claiming the Sansthan was not the owner of the land. However, the civil judge dismissed the plea, which was then challenged before the district court. At this point, the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Trust and the temple management joined the petition. The Trust also refuted the settlement made in 1968 between Sri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sangh and Shahi Masjid Eidgah. According to the Trust, it along with the deity Lord Krishna are the rightful owners of the land. In the 1968 settlement, the temple management authority Sri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sangh had conceded the 2.37 acre of land on which the mosque is built to the Edigah. At the bottom of the debates about whether a temple existed or not lies another debate - can these religious sites be converted? That is where The Places of Worship Act 1991 comes up. The Narasimha Rao government passed the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act in 1991, at the peak of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. The act mandated that with Babri Masjid in Ayodhya as the only exception, the religious character of all other places of worship would be maintained as it was on the day of India's Independence, August 15, 1947. Section 3 of the Act states that, \"No person shall convert any place of worship of any religious denomination or any section thereof into a place of worship of a different section of the same religious denomination or of a different religious denomination or any section thereof.\" The punishment for not adhering to the act is a fine and imprisonment up to three years.

    "article_content": "We don't support landscape mode yet. Please go back to portrait mode for the best experience The Supertech twin towers located in Emerald Court at Sector 93B of Noida are set to be demolished on August 28 after a lengthy legal battle that spanned over a decade. In 2009, four residents of Emerald Court went against Supertech's plan for two twin towers, which were coming up in violation of building by-laws, and formed a core legal committee that moved court. On August 31, 2021, the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of the twin towers within three months for violating regulations on the distance between buildings. The D-day has now been fixed. The 40-storied twin towers are the tallest buildings in India ever to be demolished using controlled explosions. Edifice Engineering along with Sout African Jet Demolition has been selected jointly by Noida and the Central Building Research Institute, Roorkee to carry out the demolition. The company has experience having demolished an 18-storey building in the past. The two towers are named Apex and Ceyane. Apex is the taller one, with 32 floors and its height is 102 metres. The second tower; Ceyane; is tower number 16 and has 29 floors. Its height is 95 metres. The two towers together have 915 flats, 21 commercial shops, and two basements. Razing down a multi-storied building from the ground up is not an easy job and it requires precision planning, that takes in information to avoid every chance of collateral damage to nearby properties and people. To demolish the Supertech Twin towers nearly 3,500 kilograms of explosives will be used that will be triggered by a charge to bring down the towers in just nine seconds. Demolition experts, working closely with engineers will place the explosives in holes that will be drilled into the columns of the two buildings. The columns will have to be filled with layers of mire mesh and geotextile fabric to contain the concrete debris from imploding out when it falls down. The building is being engineered to fall inwards, floor by floor. The team will trigger the charge first in Ceyane tower, which has 31 stories and is 97 meters in height followed by Apex, standing tall at 100 meters and with 32 floors. The towers are currently being placed with explosives in a process called 'charging'. More than 3,500 kg of explosives will be filled in around 9,400 holes drilled in the columns and shears of the skeletal structures of the twin towers for the demolition. The charging of the buildings was completed on August 22, five days before demolition. The explosions will be carried out with a mix of RDX and other explosives used in mining. The technique to be used in the actual demolition on August 28 is implosion. Implosion is one of the many methods employed by demolition experts to rage a building, structure, or construction. It is employed when you want the structure to collapse inwards and onto itself. While it requires explosives and detonators, it's not simply just setting the charge and punching the detonator triggering a blast. It also relies on gravity for the building to collapse in a pre-determined pattern. For it to happen, engineers will have to tactfully remove the supporting structure of a building at a certain point that brings it down upon itself. To do so, explosives are drilled into key components of the building that support the structure at different levels from bottom to top. The support structures include columns, beams, and slabs that hold the building in its entirety. The explosives are then detonated on the lower level and, in a step-by-step manner, and the charges go off from the bottom to the top. This sequential order of detonation results in the building collapsing on its own footprint or along a predetermined path. The controlled implosion will lead to one floor crashing down to the other. Uktarsh Mehta, partner with Edifice Engineering told India Today, “We have had a series of meetings with the nearby residents and they are satisfied with the safety measures we are taking. We have installed nets, cloth, and perimeter curtains to provide three layers of safety from the dust and debris to the nearby buildings. Any debris will be arrested by either of the three layers. Any stray debris will be caught by the geotextiles being installed between the buildings.” He further said that trenches are being dug at the perimeter to prevent any damage to the nearby building through the shockwave of the explosion. Containers are also being placed between the twin towers and the nearby buildings for extra safety. “The entire operation will take seven to eight minutes and the locals will have to be evacuated during the period. The dust will settle in the next seven to eight minutes. The building will collapse like water. The controlled explosions will take place in such a way that all floors will collapse on the floor below,\" he added. To minimize damage, over 5,000 residents of the nearby Emerald Court and ATS Village societies have been told to vacate the premises by 7.30 am on August 28. They can return after 4 pm only with safety clearance. Entry of people, vehicles, and animals will be restricted in the close proximity area — known as the exclusion zone — of the twin towers in Sector 93A, the plan stated. The Noida-Greater Noida Expressway, which is close to the twin towers, will remain shut for vehicular movement from 2.15 pm to 2.45 pm on August 28. Fire tenders and ambulances required for emergency services shall be parked on the road constructed behind the park in front of the twin towers. On post-demolition debris management, a Noida Authority official said \"35,000 cubic metres of rubble\" is expected to be left in the aftermath of the demolition. \"Of this, 6,000 to 7,000 cubic metres would gather in the basement of twin towers,\" the official added. To control the dust, which will be a major problem post demolition, several fire tenders will be sent to sprinkle water. The disposal of the debris has not yet been decided.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Out of the 240 seats the BJP won, not a single seat had victory margins of less than 1,000 or 500. Its lowest victory margin was more than 1,500. Following the results of the Lok Sabha elections, many on social media shared a set of figures claiming that the Bharatiya Janata Party manipulated the results in 130 of the 240 seats it won. According to these posts, the BJP won 30 seats with a margin of less than 500 votes and more than 100 seats with a margin of less than 1,000 votes. The posts further stated that the actual number of seats the BJP won thus could have been 110 (240-130), insinuating election manipulation. Calling for an investigation into the results of these 130 seats, many added that a professor of Ashoka University named Sabyasachi Das had to resign after he stated that there is a scope for manipulation in such small victory margins. One person wrote on Facebook , “So BJP has won 30 seats with a margin of <500 votes. Won 100+ seats with a margin of <1000 votes. These seats should be analysed by 3 retired SC Justices. If manipulation has been done, then the real figures are 240-130= Just 110 seats for the NDA.” Its archive can be seen here . India Today Fact Check found the BJP did not win even a single seat by a margin of less than 1,000 or 500 votes. Its lowest victory margin was more than 1,500. The Election Commission of India has listed all the 240 winning candidates of BJP along with their victory margins on its website. According to it, Rabindra Narayan Behera won from the Jajpur seat of Odisha by 1,587 votes, which was the lowest victory margin of all the BJP candidates. Moreover, the BJP won only eight seats with a margin of less than 10,000 votes. It is thus, more than clear, that the figures making the rounds on social media are baseless. This brings us to Professor Sabyasachi Das, who has been mentioned in a viral post accusing the BJP of manipulating the results. Das was an assistant professor of economics at Ashoka University in Sonipat, Haryana. In 2023, he released a research paper named “Democratic Backsliding in the World's Largest Democracy”. In this paper, Das reportedly expressed the possibility of the BJP winning closely-contested constituencies in the 2019 general elections by manipulating the results . After a lot of backlash, Ashoka University distanced itself from this paper and Das subsequently resigned from the university."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The viral claims are false. A draft of the UP Population Control Bill was released in 2021 but it has not been presented in the Legislative Assembly yet. Has Uttar Pradesh’s Yogi Adityanath government implemented the Population Control Bill in the state? Many on social media are making this claim. An X user while sharing a Republic TV clip wrote , “HUGE: Yogi ji removed all Govt Subsidies and Benefits for any family that has over Two children. They also cannot participate in local elections. Population Control Bill unleashed. No more appeasement, just action.” Its archive can be seen here. The same claim was also made on the social media platform Threads. India Today Fact Check found that the viral claims are false. A draft of the UP Population Control Bill was released in 2021 but it has not been presented in Legislative Assembly as of yet. We could not find any recent news report from credible sources regarding the Population Control Bill’s implementation in UP. However, we found many reports from 2021 according to which, a draft of the UP Population Control Bill was created by the State Law Commission and was uploaded on its website on July 10, 2021. The public was also encouraged to send in their suggestions by July 19, 2021. The draft bill had provisions to debar people who have more than two children from government schemes and perks. However, the bill was not presented in the UP Legislative Assembly. According to ABP News , when UP CM Yogi Adityanath was asked about the bill in September 2021, he said, “Everything has a time. You people were earlier saying ‘ Mandir wahin baneyenge, tareekh nahin batayenge’ but the temple’s construction has started. Article 370 was also removed.” India Today Fact Check also spoke to BJP UP spokesperson Manish Shukla regarding the update on the bill. Shukla also corroborated that the bill has not yet been presented in the Assembly. He mentioned that the draft was released in 2021 and suggestions were sought from the public, but it was never taken up in the Assembly. It’s also noteworthy that the Republic TV news report being shared with the viral claims is from July 11, 2021. A look at the complete video report on Republic TV’s YouTube channel makes it clear that the anchor is talking about the draft and not the implementation of the bill. Thus, it is clear that the UP Population control bill has not been implemented, contrary to what is being claimed in the viral posts. It is also noteworthy that the UP Legislative Assembly is not in session at the moment and hence no bill can be presented right now."

A video that has been widely shared on social media shows a cargo ship on fire in the middle of the sea, with black smoke billowing from it. Those sharing the video claimed it showed another US ship attacked by the Yemeni extremist group Houthis. #Yemen #Houthis hit another american ship! pic.twitter.com/WKGCacurKb — War Report (@cveks) June 9, 2024 One such post on Facebook was captioned: \"Yemen Houthis hit another american ship!\" India Today Fact Check found that the video is from May 2021 and shows a cargo vessel carrying a consignment of chemicals near Sri Lanka that caught fire. A reverse search of keyframes from the viral video led to the same clip, featured in a Chinese news report published on May 27, 2021, making it clear that the video is not related to any recent attack. According to this report, the video shows the Express Pearl, a container vessel that caught fire near the port of Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Reportedly, the fire engulfed almost the entire container ship. Crew members, however, were safely evacuated. Subsequent searches with relevant keywords led us to a Russian news report from May 25, 2021, that noted that a fire was detected on a cargo ship carrying a consignment of chemicals on the same day, after which an explosion occurred, leading to the massive blaze. It is noteworthy that the Indian Navy sent its three ships — Samudra Prahari, Vaibhav, and Vajrato — to combat the fire. The official press release regarding this deployment can be seen here. Different visuals of the fire were covered in several news reports and Instagram accounts from May 25, 2021. According to a Hindustan Times report dated May 30, 2021, authorities successfully brought the fire under control. The ship, however, sank a couple of days later during an attempt to tow the vessel to deeper waters. The fiasco with the MV X-Press Pearl, the Singapore-registered container ship, resulted not only in a monetary loss of millions but also caused long-term environmental damage to the Indian Ocean around the Sri Lankan coast. On November 2023, visuals from this accident were misattributed as a Houthi attack on an Israeli ship. India Today fact-checked it at the time."

(Content Warning: Video contains graphic violence) A gruesome video making the rounds on social media purports to show two men fighting each other with machetes to secure their drug territory somewhere in India. The video shows one of the men losing his hand during the fight. It has been shared with captions like: “Nigerians in India”. India Today Fact Check found that this incident is from the Dominican Republic. It has nothing to do with India. We noticed many people reacting to this video pointed out that this happened in the Dominican Republic. A subsequent keyword search led us to a May 16 report in the New York Post that said this footage showed a “wild machete fight in the Dominican Republic”, adding that per local reports, the men were friends who were fighting over a woman. Since Spanish is the most widely spoken language in the Dominican Republic, we searched about this incident in this language. We found that Ramon Tolentino, a journalist based in the Dominican Republic shared this video on X on May 15, 2024, stating that this incident happened in the municipality of Consuelo, which is located in the province of San Pedro de Macor­s. According to Diario Libre, Dominican Republic’s leading daily tabloid newspaper, this incident happened on May 14 and the person whose hand was chopped off was 31-year-old Kelvin Melquiades Trinidad. The other man was identified as Nelvin Felix. According to the Spanish news website Diario De Morelos , the clash was triggered by an alleged love triangle, and the two men seen fighting in the viral video were former friends. Surprisingly, in a May 15 report published in La Tribuna, there is a video, in which Kelvin can be seen smiling and dancing, with a bandage wrapped over his stump wrist. A post shared by EL RETOSO (@elretoso) Thus, it’s more than clear that this video has nothing to do with India."

The festival, also known as Bakrid, involves the customary sacrifice of an animal, usually a goat. Amid the celebrations, a video allegedly showing the public slaughtering of animals in a housing society went viral on social media. Several users sharing the video claimed the incident was from West Bengal. A Facebook user shared the viral video of the residential complex flooded with blood and wrote, “Warning: If you can see it, then see it, otherwise delete it without opening it. Scene of celebrating Bakrid in Bengal. More than 200 cows were slaughtered in front of this residential complex.” Its archive can be seen here. India Today Fact Check found that the viral video is not from West Bengal. It is an old video from Dhaka, Bangladesh. We closely examined the video and noticed the watermark “Ashwini Sahay”. Using this information and a keyword search, we found the viral video on the X account with the same username , shared on July 1, 2023.

Following this, we searched for residential societies in Mirpur and found a picture of multi-storey buildings in a report in the Bangladeshi news portal Protham Alo. The buildings in the report closely resembled those seen in the viral video. The report identified the buildings as part of the Shopnonagar Residential Project in Mirpur 9, Dhaka. On further searches on Google Maps for the Shopnonagar Residential Project we found buildings matching those in the viral video. Additionally, we noticed a signage on a white building in the viral video. The signage identified the places as a “Masjid” and a “Community Bhawan” in Bangla. Thereafter, we searched for these terms within the Shopnonagar Residential Project on Google Maps and located the building seen in the video. Comparing the viral video with photos tagged to this location confirmed that both show the same place. Although we could not confirm the exact date and context of the video, it is more than clear that it is not from West Bengal."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story This is a scene from an Iranian TV series ‘Zahra's Blue Eyes’. The scene shows Zahra and her grandfather escaping Israeli forces. A video allegedly showing an old Muslim man sexually assaulting a minor girl has been widely shared online. An X user shared the video and wrote, “Muhammad Moin Al-Din, 86 years old. He sexually assaults a 7-year-old girl in an agricultural field. This is an Islamic culture, and also Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam, married Aisha when she was 6 years old. What do you think of people who believe in this culture? They live in the West today in their numbers in the millions.” Its archive can be seen here . India Today found that the video does not show any real incident. It’s from an Iranian TV series called “Zahra's Blue Eyes”. Our Probe We noticed that people responding to one of the viral posts pointed out that this clip was from a 2004 movie called \"Zahra’s Eyes\". A keyword search revealed that \"Zahra’s Blue Eyes\" is an Iranian TV series that began in 2004. The series was originally filmed in Persian but was subsequently dubbed into Arabic. A compiled version of the various episodes of this series was uploaded to a YouTube channel named “Network Movie” on January 26, 2024. The viral clip can be seen in this video at around the 2-hour-32-minute mark. According to the YouTube post, the show is about an Israeli commander who has a blind child and tries to take the eyes of a Palestinian child so that his child can see. He sends a medical delegation to a school in a refugee camp in Palestine for an eye examination. During the examination, doctors admire the eyes of a girl named Zahra. Following this, the Israeli commander tries to trick Zahra and her family and take her eyes. The Middle East Media Research Institute, a US-based organisation, also shared episodes of this show on its website. The same old man and the young girl from the viral video can be seen towards the beginning of episode 6 of the show. Going through the episodes , it becomes clear that the viral video shows a sequence where Zahra and her grandfather trying to escape from Israeli forces. Thus, it’s clear that visuals from a 10-year-old Iranian TV series are being falsely shared as a Muslim man sexually assaulting a minor."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The viral video is from 2021, not the recent G7 Summit. The Pope met several state leaders along with Modi on the sidelines of the meet. The X account of the Kerala Congress recently courted controversy with its post mocking Prime Minister Narendra Modi meeting Pope Francis at the G7 Summit in Italy. The party soon deleted the post and apologised to Christians. Amid this, a video of the Pope meeting PM Modi has gone viral on social media with the claim that out of all the state leaders, only PM Modi was invited by the Pope to meet him during the G7 Summit in Italy. A Facebook user sharing the video wrote , “The media doesn't show this outreach. Only Modi Ji was invited by Pope out of all state heads attending the G7 meet in Italy. This is the power of India today. No credit is given to Modi Ji by Indian Seculars.” Its archive can be seen here. India Today Fact Check found that the viral video is from 2021 — not the recent G7 Summit. The Pope met several state leaders along with PM Modi on the sidelines of the global leaders meet. Reverse-searching keyframes from the viral video led us to several video reports on YouTube from October 2021. A video report by Voice of America matched the visuals of the viral video. The caption noted that PM Modi met Pope Francis at the Vatican on October 30, 2021, and invited him to visit India. At that time, PM Modi was in Rome for the G20 Summit. Similar news reports of PM Modi meeting the Pope in 2021 in Vatican City can be seen here and here. It’s noteworthy, however, that Modi did meet the Pope at the recently held G7 summit in Italy. Several news reports covered the brief meeting and shared pictures of Modi embracing the head of the Catholic Church following a handshake. PM Modi also shared photos of the encounter on his social media accounts. Met Pope Francis on the sidelines of the @G7 Summit. I admire his commitment to serve people and make our planet better. Also invited him to visit India. @Pontifex pic.twitter.com/BeIPkdRpUD — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 14, 2024 Before and after his address at the summit, the Pope had a series of private bilateral meetings with several state leaders, including US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. However, he did not meet PM Modi privately. The Pope was taken around the table in a wheelchair to greet the world leaders gathered at the summit. Pictures of the Pope meeting other heads of state can be seen here and here. Thus, it’s clear an old video of PM Modi’s meeting with the Pope is being shared to falsely claim that he was the only state leader to meet the head of the Catholic Church during the recent G7 Summit."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story This video is from a street takeover in Connecticut in May 2023. It has nothing to do with Juneteenth celebrations. A video of a group of men vandalising a woman’s car is going viral on social media . In the clip, people can be seen kicking the car and jumping on its roof in the middle of a street. Even after the car’s occupant confronted the men, they continued to vandalise the car, until she finally drove away. Those sharing the video claimed that this incident unfolded recently in the United States during the Juneteenth celebration. On June 19, 1865, enslaved African Americans in Texas were freed . This is why Juneteenth is celebrated every year on June 19. It’s a federal holiday, which marks the annual commemoration of the end of slavery in the United States. Sharing the video on Facebook , one person wrote, “Good Lord. What do you mean coward culture? This mostly peaceful Juneteenth celebration was doing just fine until this ‘uppity’ white woman showed up and ruined it for everyone! Good thing we have a strong leader and President like Joe Biden that can control this plague of white supremacists we’re facing and steady enough to restore unity and peace in our communities.” Its archive can be seen here . India Today Fact Check found that this video is from a street takeover in Connecticut in May 2023. It has nothing to do with Juneteenth celebrations. A reverse search of keyframes from the viral clip led us to a news report about this incident, dated May 31, 2023. According to it, Stephanie and Dennis Sargisian of Tolland, Connecticut, were heading home from dinner in their car when they passed through a street takeover on May 21, 2023. The crowd surrounded their vehicle and started vandalising it. The report carried another video of the incident, shot from a different angle, which can be seen below. As per reports , a large group of people blocked Route 195 in Tolland on May 21, 2023, for doing street stunts. The woman, who was travelling on that route along with her partner confronted the group. As soon as she pulled over, the crowd began vandalising her vehicle. Following the incident, the couple called the police, who then arrested Jefferson Duron , the alleged leader of the takeover by the car enthusiasts. We also found a \"Go Fund Me\" page made by Staphanie’s daughter Megan Sargisian to help repair the car. It is noteworthy that an incident of shooting was reported in Oakland after a fight broke out during an illegal sideshow of vehicles on the night of June 19. However, it is more than clear that the viral video has nothing to do with the recent Juneteenth celebrations in the US."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The incident is not real; the viral video was created using VFX and editing techniques. A video of a man allegedly performing a stunt in the middle of the road is going viral on social media. The video shows a man walking from the pavement to the centre of the road, lying on his stomach, and a bus moving over him. Those sharing the video claim that the incident took place in Hyderabad, where a man performed a dangerous stunt to make a reel. A user sharing the viral video wrote , “In a bid to make #reel, a youngster risked his life by doing a dangerous stunt by suddenly lying on the road in front of a running bus in #Hyderabad. The stunt video is now going viral on #SocialMedia, triggering outrage among netizens.” An archived version of the post can be seen here. India Today Fact Check team found that the video was created using VFX and does not show a real incident. Reverse-searching the keyframes of the viral video led us to an Instagram account, creative_saii , where the video was first posted on June 16, 2024, with the caption asking if it is edited or real. The video has 20k shares and about 1,400 comments. The account belongs to a video editor who posts educational tutorials on video editing techniques. Through the video, we found another account, creative_better_things , which was tagged in the viral video. This account’s bio contained a link to a Google Drive folder hosting several videos about editing and marketing tutorials. In the drive, we found a similar video of a man walking on a road in traffic and suddenly coming under a moving car. All of this gave us reason to believe that the viral video could be edited. The archived link of the video can be accessed here. On close examination, we noticed several unusual aberrations in the video. First, there was a difference in the shadows. All the objects in the video, like the bus, auto, and scooter, had visible shadows, but the man did not cast a shadow on the road. Second, the road markings blurred, vanished, changed position, and reappeared when the man crossed them, revealing gaps in editing. Third, when the bus passes over the man, his head and the bottom of the front end of the bus appear to overlap in a single frame. For further confirmation, we contacted Chetan, co-founder of Blackbird Academy , the PR agency and studio that made the video. He confirmed that the video was created using VFX and editing software and was not of a real incident. He stated that the objective behind the video was to teach young editors how to make realistic videos with simple tricks and skills. The official handle of the Managing Director of Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TGSRTC) also issued a clarification that the incident shown in the video is not real. à°¸àñà°·à°²àñâ à°®àñà°áà°¿à°ïà°¾à°²àñ à°µàñà°°à°²àñâ à° à°µàñà°äàñà°èàñà°è à° à°µàñà°áà°¿à°ïàñ à°ëàñà°àñâ. à°à°æà°¿ à°ªàñà°°àñà°äà°¿à°à°¾ à°à°áà°¿à°àñÆà°áàñ à°µàñà°áà°¿à°ïàñ. à°¸àñà°·à°²àñâ à°®àñà°áà°¿à°ïà°¾à°²àñ à°ªà°¾à°ªàñà°²à°°àñâ à°àñà°¸à° à°àñà°à°æà°°àñ à°à°²à°¾ à°µàñà°áà°¿à°ïàñà°²à°èàñ à°à°áà°¿à°àñâ à°àñà°¸à°¿ à°µà°æàñà°²àñà°äàñà°èàñà°èà°¾à°°àñ. à°à°²à°¾à°à°à°¿ à°µàñÆà°à°¿à°²à°¿à°àñà°·àñà°à°²à°äàñ à°Æà°°àñà°àñà°¸àñ à°ªàñà°°à°äà°¿à°·àñà°à°èàñ à°æà°¿à°à°à°¾à°°àñà°àñ à°ªàñà°°à°ïà°äàñà°èà° à°àñà°ïà°áà° à°®à°à°à°¿ à°ªà°æàñà°æà°äà°¿ à°à°¾à°æàñ. à°²àñà°àñâ à°²àñ, à°à°¾à°®àñÆà°à°àñà°² à°àñà°¸à° à°àñà°¸àñ à° à°äà°°à°¹à°¾âæ pic.twitter.com/Eia1GCSxyr — VC Sajjanar - MD TGSRTC (@tgsrtcmdoffice) June 21, 2024 Thus, a video made using VFX, allegedly showing a man lying dangerously under a bus in Hyderabad, is being shared as a real incident."

    "article_content": "1. SELECTING A STORY FOR FACT CHECK We stand on neutral ground while picking up a story to fact-check devoid of any political or circumstantial bias. Sifting through requests from our audiences is the first step towards selecting a claim to begin the fact-checking process. We track mainstream and social media non-stop for possibly dubious information, propaganda, suspiciously viral posts and misinformation, including contentious/controversial quotes attributed to public figures. Such claims can reach us by way of tweets or controversial speeches by politicians, hashtags designed to provoke, viral videos, memes, Facebook pages and messaging apps like WhatsApp. The virality of topics is a stand-out criterion for a fact check. We make extensive use of internet tools like Meta Content Library and Google Trends to keep a tab on what is being shared widely at any point. Conspicuous rumours and debates in the public domain on issues designed to trigger controversy or social conflict could also trigger the fact-checking process. 2. RESEARCH AND INVESTIGATION Once material for a fact check is decided upon, it is discussed during an editorial meeting. The next step is to establish an understanding of the material, and exactly what was said or posted. Extreme caution is exercised to arrive first at whether the claim is even fact-checkable. We do not pick up opinions for fact check or try to debunk claims made in the form of opinion. After establishing what precisely the claim is, we reach out directly to the person or the entity and seek evidence to support the claim. We first seek the claimant's reaction by all possible means. Our focus is then on the credibility and reliability of the source. We rely on government websites, reputed journals, websites of well known organizations, magazines, dailies or company publications for source material of claims and data. Apart from conventional methods of reaching out to possible sources, we also use various internet tools to verify the origin of viral photographs or videos before arriving at a conclusion. Contacting experts on the subject, official authorities or police and recording their views is also an important element that runs alongside in the fact check process. 3. CROSS VERIFICATION FROM THE SPOT TV Today Network has one of the largest national reporting resources in the country. As and when required, we use this wide network of reporters and stringers spread across the country and abroad to cross-check facts on the ground. To ensure authenticity and impartiality, we never assign the responsibility of a cross-verification or corroboration to a reporter who may have filed his/her own report on the same subject or who has been a primary source for an information we are looking into. We provide hyperlinks where possible within our stories pointing to the source of information and evidence used to reach a conclusion so that readers can themselves track authenticity. 4. REPORT WRITING AND REVIEW We try to present verified facts in a simple, precise and transparent manner along with a deep, relevant perspective. We put together reports with an adequate level of detail, but easy to consume and understand, with a clear path tracking how we reached the conclusions we did. A great deal of attention is paid to the tone and tenor of the subject matter in fact check posts in order to underscore neutrality. We refrain from editorial comment and restrict ourselves to the specific fact we have checked. The report then goes through another review by a copy editor before publication. 5. PUBLISHING AND FEEDBACK After publication of a fact checked report, we closely monitor feedback from our audiences through story comments or social media. If an error is brought to our notice, we examine it thoroughly and, if necessary, effect an update or correction in accordance with our well-established correction policy. .about-us-heading{display:none;}"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story With the deadly heatwave in Delhi killing scores of people , crematoriums across the national capital are seeing a surge in the number of bodies. For instance, 142 bodies were cremated in the city's Nigam Bodh Ghat this season, the highest since the Covid-19 pandemic, when a record 253 bodies were cremated at that time. On average, 60 bodies are cremated at the Nigam Bodh Ghat every day. During winters, the number of bodies ranges between 60 and 90. However, with 142 bodies being cremated on June 19, this is the highest such figure in a single day. Officials said 70 to 90 bodies have been reaching the crematorium in a single day for the past few days. For instance, 43 bodies were cremated on June 14, 53 on June 15, 70 on June 16 and 54 on June 17. These numbers then spiked to 97 on June 18 and 142 on June 19. \"This has never happened before that the death count reached 90 during summers, even though it is common during winters. The extreme heat has not only surpassed our figures in the last winter but has also posed challenges in the cremation process,\" Suman Gupta, the in-charge of Nigam Bodh Ghat, said. The crematorium has ample platforms for cremation, but different communities have varying funeral rites, which made the simultaneous cremation of 142 bodies a significant challenge. It boasts 120 platforms and six CNG machines. Till June 19, a total of 1,101 bodies were cremated at the Nigam Bodh Ghat and could surpass the figure of 1,570 achieved in June 2022, within this month. In June 2023, 1,319 bodies were cremated and 1,210 in June 2021 in the crematorium."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics, Olympians and climate change experts are raising warning signs about the threat the ongoing heatwave can have on the health of the athletes at the event. Elaborating on the health risks, the experts released a report called \"Rings of Fire\", to outline challenges faced by athletes regarding extreme heat, air pollution, food and water insecurity and lack of shade amid soaring temperatures. They highlighted the grave impact of climate change in sports , putting athletes under a \"competitive disadvantage, disrupting sleep and forcing them to train earlier and earlier into the morning just to avoid the worst temperatures of the day.\" The Paris Olympics involve about 10,500 athletes from 200 countries or regions. (Photo: Getty Images) Since the Tokyo Olympics was known as the \"hottest in history,\" with temperatures over 34 degrees Celsius and humidity reaching almost 70%, experts are trying to avoid scenarios from last time, where competitors vomited and fainted at finish lines, and wheelchairs were deployed to carry athletes away from sun-scorched arenas, in the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympics. HEALTH RISKS FOR ATHLETES For the event, Mike Tipton, Associate Professor of Environmental Physiology at the University of Portsmouth, explained certain warning signs of the heatwave so that immediate medical attention is given to athletes. Heat cramps These usually occur in those muscles being exercised due to dehydration and alterations in electrolyte concentration , and low energy stores. Erriyon Knighton, of the United States, competes in a Men's 200-meter heat during the World Athletics Championships in Budapest, Hungary. (Photo: AP) Heat exhaustion The most common form of heat illness, the inability to continue exercising in the heat, is usually seen in unacclimatised individuals. The warning signs for heat exhaustion are weakness, pale and cool skin, fatigue, thirst and profuse sweating. Heat stroke This is a medical emergency resulting from failure of the thermoregulatory system as a result of deep body temperature rising to more than 40.5 degrees Celsius. Confusion, hot and dry skin, strong and rapid pulse, are the warning signs. Other symptoms include faintness or dizziness, sensation of sweating, chills or goosebumps, and nausea. RECOMMENDATIONS The experts recommended smart scheduling. \"Sporting authorities must take into account heat extremes when scheduling events, avoiding the hottest parts of the day for exposed sports and rescheduling events when needed,\" they mentioned. Katie Ledecky swims during the Women's 1500 freestyle finals Wednesday, June 19, 2024, at the US Swimming Olympic Trials in Indianapolis. (Photo: AP) Limiting heat exposure and having water breaks in training and competition are positive developments. But, as extreme heat events become more common, organisers need to invest more in protecting competitors, fans, support staff, workers, and volunteers. The experts urged athletes to speak out about heat risks or the environment since many don't open up \"due to fears of being called weak or being accused of hypocrisy for travelling to events.\" \"This needs to change to deliver progress, athletes must be empowered to speak up about their experience with the ongoing and future impacts of climate change,\" they wrote. Here are the five recommendations: The Olympics will be held in Paris between July 26 and August 11 this year."

Thousands are also being treated for heatstroke as temperatures mounted to 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca. Unregistered pilgrims accounted for more than half of those who died. Around 658 pilgrims from Egypt have died, according to an Arab diplomat. Of them, 630 were unregistered pilgrims. As per sources, 90 fatalities were from India . Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia have also reported pilgrim deaths. Several pilgrims are reported to be missing too, with Facebook and other social media networks flooded with pictures of the missing and requests for information. More than 1.8 million people are taking part in this year's Hajj, one of the world's largest religious gatherings, according to the Saudi government. As part of precautionary measures, Hajj officials have asked pilgrims to carry umbrellas and stay hydrated. The Saudi army has deployed more than 1,600 personnel with medical units to tend to heatstroke victims and 30 rapid response teams, CNN reported. Another 5,000 health and first aid volunteers have also been stationed. Last year, only 240 pilgrim deaths were reported, most of them Indonesians. On Monday, the National Meteorological Centre reported a high of 51.8 degrees Celsius at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. Studies have shown that temperatures in the region are rising by 0.4 degrees Celsius each decade."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The intense heatwave across most parts of the country has led to 110 deaths since March even though light to moderate rainfall in Delhi and Kolkata brought much needed respite on Thursday. Relief may soon be around the corner as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted the advancement of the monsoon in the next 3–4 days over east central India and east India. As per Health Ministry data, the highest number of heatwave-related deaths was reported from Uttar Pradesh (36), followed by Bihar (17), and Rajasthan (16). Madhya Pradesh has reportedly recorded the highest number of heatstroke cases at 10,636, but only five fatalities. The number of patients suffering from heatstroke has been increasing on an average in different hospitals and small clinics as northern and eastern India continue to reel under a relentless heatwave. A woman suffering from a heat-related illness being brought to LNJP Hospital (PTI) With maximum temperatures hovering around 46 degrees Celcius, the Health Ministry has advised hospitals to set up special units to cater to such patients. As per PTI, over 40,000 people across the country have been admitted to hospitals with suspected heatstroke between March 1 and June 18 this year. The national capital recorded 17 deaths due to suspected heat-related illnesses in the last 24 hours, even as isolated rain across Delhi since Wednesday night brought down temperatures. The respite, though short-lived, came after Delhi recorded its warmest summer night in the last 55 years on Tuesday. IMD scientist Soma Sen said Delhi will see an isolated heatwave on June 23-24, but temperatures won't see a massive rise. \"There are pre-monsoon showers. Its impact will weaken from today. But easterlies will advance here due to which the temperatures won't go up a lot. Still, there is likely to be an isolated heatwave on June 23-24 in Delhi,\" ANI quoted Sen as saying. The brutal heatwave conditions in Delhi have coincided with a rise in the number of cremations at Nigambodh Ghat. However, it is not confirmed if the deaths are related to heatstrokes. The Nigambodh Ghat Sanchalan Samiti told PTI that 142 corpses were brought to the crematorium on Wednesday, a massive rise from the daily average of 50–60 bodies. On Tuesday, 97 bodies were cremated. Heavy rain lashed Maharashtra's Thane and neighbouring Palghar districts on Thursday as the south-west monsoon gathered pace. While several parts of Mumbai received showers on Wednesday and Thursday morning, Thane and Palghar bore the brunt. In Palghar, an overflowing river flooded a portion of a road , bringing traffic to a standstill. Local train services on the Western Railway were disrupted as tracks between Boisar and Umroli stations were flooded due to heavy rainfall. The IMD has predicted more showers for the next six days. In Thane, trees were uprooted as heavy rainfall crippled normal life. In Savarkar Nagar, a tree fell under the impact of strong winds, damaging two vehicles. A fire department personnel was injured after a tree branch fell on him during a rescue operation. Cooling water mist being released to provide relief from the scorching heat in Varanasi (PTI) East central India and east India are expected to get relief in the next 3–4 days with the advancement of the monsoon. Chhattisgarh, parts of East Madhya Pradesh, parts of East Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Bengal are expected to receive rainfall soon, said IMD scientist Soma Sen. \"The monsoon has further advanced... Due to this, humidity has increased in all these states. The heatwave situation has now passed. A little heatwave has been recorded today too in the western Himalayan region, northeast India, but it has largely passed,\" ANI quoted Sen as saying. The IMD scientist further said that the western disturbance over northwest India would gradually move away from Friday. Moreover, heatwave conditions are likely to subside in Punjab and Haryana. \"So, temperatures are likely to rise from the day after tomorrow. We don't expect it to be a heatwave situation with a rise of 2-3 degrees Celsius but west UP will continue to face heatwave situation for 5 days... We are not issuing any heatwave warning for Punjab and Haryana,\" Sen said."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story As Delhi battled a brutal heatwave for over a month, a woman’s post on ‘besan ke laddu’ has gone viral and if you are wondering what the connection is, read on. So Bhumika, a homeopathic doctor by profession, received a box of ‘besan ke laddoos’ from her mother. But thanks to the rising temperatures in Delhi, the ‘laddoos’ soon turned into ‘halwa’ as the sweets melted in the scorching heat. In a post on X, Bhumika shared a picture of the box of sweets, which originally contained ‘besan ke laddoos’ but the Delhi heat turned it into ‘halwa’. “Dear, besan ke laddoo. Welcome to Delhi ki garmi,” reads the caption of the now-viral post shared by Bhumika. Take a look at the post here: In another post, Bhumika shared an update: “Besan ke laddoo tasted way better in melted form.” The comments on the post are hilarious. Sample these: Meanwhile, light rainfall lashed several parts of Delhi and its neighbouring areas on June 20, bringing huge relief to the national capital . Temperatures in Delhi have remained above 40 degrees Celsius since May 12. Over this period of time, the city saw 16 days when the mercury reached or surpassed 45 degrees Celsius."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Major heatwaves have gripped several parts of northern India for the past few weeks, especially in the capital city of New Delhi. With more heat-related illnesses rising, most people are consuming medications, that might be causing dehydration, which might make it difficult for the body to cope with high temperatures. Taking certain drugs like blood pressure, medications relating to mental health and even allergies, might make it difficult for the body to get hydrated. Dr Anurag Aggarwal, Consultant, Internal Medicine, Fortis Escorts Hospital, Faridabad, shared various medications that lead to dehydration in the body. Therefore, the expert urged people to hydrate themselves better if they're consuming these medicines. Diuretics Diuretics are often prescribed for the heart and kidneys that help the body to reduce fluid through urination. Since it increases urine production by the kidneys, the body loses more water and essential electrolytes, leading to dehydration, if it is not compensated. Laxatives Laxatives accelerate bowel movements, increasing the frequency of stools. This can cause significant water loss, alongside loss of electrolytes, leading to dehydration. Various blood pressure medications increase urine production and also cause an imbalance in electrolytes. (Photo: Getty) Antihistamines Many anti-allergic medicines tend to reduce mucous production and can cause dry mouth. This reduced fluid consumption because of dry mouth could contribute to a lower overall body fluid balance. Antidepressants Antidepressants are prescribed in the case of various mental health illnesses. However, these medications could cause dry mouth. This leads to decreased fluid intake as individuals may not feel the need to drink water, lowering body hydration levels. Blood pressure medications Various blood pressure medications increase urine production and also cause an imbalance in electrolytes. If adequate fluid is not compensated besides just drinking water, this will make it difficult for the body to regulate its temperature.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Delhi and its adjoining areas are likely to receive rain, thunderstorms, and dust storms on Friday, the weather department has said. According to the India Meteorological Department, a partly cloudy sky was predicted over the national capital for the day. The maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to settle around 40 and 29 degrees Celsius, respectively, today, it said. On Thursday, the weather department said light rain and thunderstorms abated the heatwaves in the national capital. The maximum temperature was settled at 40 degrees Celsius, one notch above the season's average, while the minimum temperature was recorded at 29.6 degrees Celsius, two notches above the season's average, the IMD said. Swathes of northern India, including Delhi, have been in the grip of a punishingly long heatwave, increasing heat stroke casualties and prompting the Centre to issue advisories to hospitals to set up special units to cater to such patients. During the past three days, the bodies of 50 people belonging to underprivileged backgrounds were recovered around Delhi, police said on Wednesday. The western disturbance on Thursday affected parts of northern India, which had been reeling under an intense heatwave since June 7. The India Meteorological Department said no heatwave is predicted over most parts of the country in the next four to five days. The monsoon is predicted to cover central India and most parts of northwest India between June 27 and July 3. The primary rain-bearing system did not make any progress between June 13 and 19, extending the wait for rain in northern India amid the sweltering heat, it said. \"Heatwave conditions have abated from Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, North Rajasthan, North Madhya Pradesh, and many parts of Uttar Pradesh today (June 20),\" the weather office said. \"Under the influence of a western disturbance and lower-level easterlies from the Bay of Bengal, scattered to fairly widespread light/moderate rainfall has been observed over Jammu, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, north Haryana, Chandigarh, and north Uttar Pradesh during the 24 hours ending at 08.30 am. Isolated very heavy rainfall has also been observed over Uttarakhand, and isolated hailstorms over Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Punjab,\" it said. The punishingly long heatwave led to a surge in heat stroke casualties in north India, including Delhi, prompting the Centre to issue an advisory to hospitals on Wednesday to set up special units to cater to such patients. The crippling heat overwhelmed the water supply system and power grids, with Delhi and Haryana wrangling over the water crisis in the national capital."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Frequent power cuts in Uttar Pradesh in recent days have left locals scrambling for peace. Amid sweltering heat, residents in many sectors and localities of Lucknow are struggling with unscheduled power cuts, voltage fluctuations and frequent tripping of power. Residents in even urban areas and posh apartments have been grappling with power cuts for nearly three hours every day, for the last few weeks. Speaking exclusively to India Today TV, residents in Lucknow's Shipra Apartment said they were living without power despite having inverters at their homes. The residential society is located in Lucknow's Gomti Nagar, one of the most posh areas of the city. Some residents told India Today TV they spend most of the nights without power. Once, when they attempted to complain about the same, the Lucknow Electricity Supply Administration (LESA) took approximately two hours to find the fault with the electrical lines. Upon being asked about overloading, the residents said there was no overloading or tripping, but rather claimed it could be a case of power theft. \"The residents of our society are paying their bills in time,\" one of them said. Sarla Mishra and Aarti Asthana, two housewives living in the society, said they find it extremely challenging working in the kitchen during such summers, especially when there is no power. Others said outages are frequent and that they often get no response when complaining about the same. SP Nigam, a diabetic patient at the society, said he also suffers from anxiety and hypertension. His doctor has advised him for proper rest, but due to an excessive power cut, he is having sleepless nights. \"We paid lakhs to stay in such posh locations, paying bills in time,\" a seemingly disappointed Nigam said, as he questioned the government. Despite such punishable heatwave, residents in the city's Ashiyana area were seen sitting outside their homes. When asked, they claimed abrupt power cuts at their society forced them to sit outside. A resident, Sanjay Srivastava, along with several others, claimed the power supply was snapped abruptly on the night of June 19, and when they dialled the electricity helpline number, they received no response. They later decided to move to the nearby power centre only to find out the LESA workers were sleeping in the office. \"When I asked the workers about why they did not receive the various calls made to them, they said, 'We get 5,000 calls a day, can't pick all calls',\" a resident, Akshat, said. Other than housewives, elderly patients, and working professionals, students in such areas also complained of frequent power cuts and said they were unable to study. A student told India Today TV he is preparing for entrance exams and prefers studying during the night hours. However, his studies are badly disrupted due to the power cuts. \"Sometimes, we are even unable to charge our inverters, and are hence forced to move to our relatives' house in other localities till the supply at our place is restored,\" a student said. Meanwhile, several reports from Uttar Pradesh suggested enraged residents surrounded nearby powerhouses and demanded a power backup facility until the problem is resolved. They said though there were no scheduled power cuts, the outages cause serious inconveniences. The peak power demand in the state has also increased, owing to the excessive use of air conditioners and coolers."

Several pilgrims are reported to be missing too, with Facebook and other social media networks flooded with pictures of the missing and requests for information. The hajj pilgrimage is one of the five pillars of Islam, and all Muslims with means have to fulfil this religious obligation at least once in their lifetime. This year's pilgrimage witnessed a scorching heatwave with temperatures crossing 50 degrees Celsius, which is the highest in recent decades. A Saudi study revealed that temperatures in the pilgrimage area have risen by 0.4 degrees Celsius per decade. In 2023, more than 200 pilgrims died during Hajj, and over 2,000 individuals suffered from heat-related stress as temperatures soared to 48 degrees Celsius."

There are chances of good rain in and around the capital, Lucknow, on June 23-24. “Advanced monsoon conditions will arise in Central India and East India. The heatwave conditions will continue for five days in one or two areas of Western Uttar Pradesh, and the rest will get relief,” the weather officials said. Rain is expected in 24 districts of the state on Saturday. There is a warning of thunderstorms, lightning, and rain in Eastern UP for the next five days and an alert of heavy rain on June 25, the officials added.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story At least six people have died from heat-related causes this year so far in sizzling metro Phoenix, where the temperatures this week hit 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 Celsius), the Maricopa County Department of Public Health reported this week. Another 87 deaths are under investigation for possible heat-related causes through last Saturday, public health officials said in the most recent weekly update to its online heat surveillance information. Phoenix hit 115 degrees F (46 C) on Thursday and Friday, making them the hottest days of 2024 up to now.. The metro area continued to swelter through an excessive heat warning under a dome of high pressure, with some moisture and a slight cooling possible over the weekend. A heat wave baked most of the United States on Friday, with numerous areas expected to see record-breaking temperatures. “We might see a little rain over the next few days because there is a 30% chance for Phoenix,” said meteorologist Ryan Worley of the National Weather Service. ”There could be a slight cool down to around 110 degrees, but temperatures should go back up next week.” Situated in the Sonoran desert, Maricopa County saw a stunning 645 heat-related deaths last year, about 50% more than the 425 confirmed for 2022. Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs declared a state of emergency in 2023 after metro Phoenix experienced a 31-day streak of temperatures reaching at least 110 degrees F (43.3 degrees C). Maricopa County, the hottest big metro area in the U.S., is among few jurisdictions that provide regularly updated data on heat-related deaths that can be easily accessed by the public. The Office of the Medical Examiner in Pima County, home to Arizona’s second most populous city of Tucson, this year added a dashboard to track heat deaths there. So far this year, there have been at least five heat-related deaths in Pima County, plus three more in the rural counties that contract with Pima for forensic services. Last year in Pima County there were 176 heat-related deaths and another 51 such deaths in the five additional rural counties that the medical examiner handles."

On Saturday, the national capital's maximum temperature was recorded a notch above normal at 39.4 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature had settled 0.6 notches above the season's average at 28.6 degrees Celsius. On Friday, rain drenched several parts of Delhi, bringing relief from the intense heatwave that had been sweeping the city. In the 24 hours ended at 8:30 am on Saturday, the national capital recorded 4 mm of rainfall. The humidity fluctuated between 50 per cent and 62 per cent. The weather office has predicted generally cloudy skies with light rain or drizzle on Sunday. The maximum and minimum temperatures will likely settle around 40 degrees and 30 degrees Celsius, respectively. The IMD said the monsoon is likely to arrive in the national capital on June 30. Meanwhile, in Kerala, the IMD issued a red alert for Malappuram and an orange alert for Kottayam, Ernakulam, Idukki, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur and Kasaragod districts on June 22 (Saturday). For Sunday, the Met Department sounded a red alert in Kozhikode, Wayanad and Kannur and an orange alert in Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram and Kasargod. A red alert indicates heavy to extremely heavy rain of over 20 cm in 24 hours. An orange alert means very heavy rain of 11 cm to 20 cm, and a yellow alert means heavy rain between 6 cm and 11 cm. The Southwest Monsoon, on the other hand, passed through Navsari (Gujarat), Jalgaon (Maharashtra), Mandla (Madhya Pradesh), Pendra Road (Chhattisgarh), Jharsuguda (Odisha), Balasore (Odisha), Haldia (West Bengal), Pakur (Jharkhand), Sahibganj (Jharkhand) and Raxaul (Bihar), the IMD said. Conditions were favourable for further advance of the monsoon into some more parts of Gujarat, remaining parts of Maharashtra, some more parts of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Gangetic West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar and some parts of East Uttar Pradesh during the next three to four days. The Gautam Buddh Nagar health department received 18 more bodies for postmortem on June 21 amid heatwave conditions, taking the number of autopsies carried out in four days to 93, officials said on Saturday. The department has also started DNA sampling of unidentified bodies, they said. \"On June 21, we received 18 more bodies for postmortem. Out of these, six bodies are unidentified,\" Chief Medical Officer Dr Suneel Kumar Sharma said. \"Now, we have started one more thing. We are taking DNA samples of unidentified bodies and will hand them over to police whenever required. With this, these bodies can be disposed of timely and the pile up at the mortuary can be reduced,\" he added. On Friday, Sharma said the health department received at least 75 bodies for autopsy from June 18 to 20 but could not be directly linked to those to heatwave deaths. Heatwave conditions were very likely in isolated pockets of West Uttar Pradesh from June 23 to 25, and in Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi on June 24 and 25 and abate thereafter, according to the IMD. Isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall was very likely in Konkan and Goa, ghat regions of Madhya Maharashtra, Kerala, Mahe, Coastal and South Interior Karnataka, Tamil Nadu from June 23 to 26, Lakshadweep on June 23, Gujarat on June 23 and 24, and Saurashtra and Kutch on June 23 and 24, the IMD said.

Six days after a massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked Turkey and Syria, the number of dead is staggering. The teams of the Turkish Army are using heavy machinery and equipment to dig out survivors trapped under the rubble. Indian sniffer dogs, dubbed \"nameless heroes\", have been working around the clock over the rubble of collapsed buildings searching for trapped survivors in Turkey's Gaziantep, reported India Today TV’s Senior Executive Editor Gaurav Sawant from ground zero. Julie, Romio, Honey and Rambo are part of a four-member Indian dog squad engaged in rescue operations in earthquake-hit Turkey. The Labradors, trained in sniffing and rescue work, left for Turkey on Tuesday with two separate teams of the National Disaster Response Force. Sniffer dog Rambo was also leading from site to site in Gaziantep searching for possible survivors despite the winter cold. They have sent a signal of life from the debris of a multi-storeyed building in Gaziantep, where millions have been left homeless. \"These dogs are very trained to trace live victims. Rambo barked in the morning and just now it also barked. They are our actual strength. We start searching for the victims on their signal when these sniffer dogs start barking\", the Second-in command of the Indian contingent, Aditya Pratap Singh told India Today. Asked about whether rescue efforts are going in one or two directions, Singh explained, \"In the morning, we were working in two locations. Now, we are working at two worksites. We are conducting a joint operation with the Turkish Army. One Golden Retriever from the Turkish Army has also barked, giving a hint of a survivor Rambo has given the signal of the life of a victim and now we will start a technical search.\" These dogs are considered ideal for rescue work as they can smell humans trapped underneath concrete and metal.

The death toll in Turkey and Syria from the quake has surpassed 28,000 , and hope of finding many more survivors is fading despite some miraculous rescues.

A police official on the ground said Marash, a Turkish city of about 5 lakh people, might need to bury 10,000 earthquake victims. Marash is officially known as Kahramanmaras. With cemeteries in Marash city running out of space, a new area had been allotted for burials. But with the earmarked location filling up fast, the area for the mass-burial site is being expanded. There is an endless stream of vehicles bringing in the bodies of earthquake victims and a heap of coffins await the dead. After rituals, the bodies are being buried in the mass-grave site. The death toll from the earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6 rose above 34,000. It looked all set to grow further as chances of finding survivors grew increasingly remote. Some of the graves only have numbers whereas others have names. Relatives of the deceased also struggled to find the names and numbers at the graves that have wooden stubs, instead of tombstones. The work to clear the rubble from destroyed buildings is on. Search-and-rescue workers are also stumbling upon bodies as they work to clear the debris. There is anger among the locals in Marash city. People feel lives could have been saved had the authorities acted promptly. People are also blaming builders for constructing buildings that couldn't withstand the earthquake.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In the biggest minority scholarship scam in India, about 53 per cent of institutions active under the minority scholarship programme have been found to be 'fake'. An internal enquiry conducted by the Ministry of Minority Affairs revealed deep-rooted corruption in as many as 830 such institutions, leading to a scam of Rs 144.83 crore in the past 5 years. Union Minister Smriti Irani has escalated the matter to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for further investigation. India Today has learnt that the Ministry of Minority Affairs had officially lodged its complaint in the matter on July 10. The investigation involved enquiries in 100 districts across 34 states. Out of the 1572 institutions scrutinised, 830 were found to be involved in fraudulent activities. The statistics come from 21 out of the 34 states, while investigations into the institutions in remaining states are still underway. For now, the authorities have ordered the freezing of accounts linked to these 830 institutions. The Ministry's scholarship program extends to around 1,80,000 institutions, covering students from class 1 to higher education. The initiative was launched in the academic year 2007-2008. With fake beneficiaries for the program, scholarships meant for minority students were claimed by these institutions every year. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will probe the nodal officers of these institutions who gave approval reports, the district nodal officers who verified the fake cases, and how multiple states allowed this scam to persist over the years. Sources told India Today that the ministry has also raised questions about how banks allowed the opening of fake accounts for beneficiaries, with fake Aadhar cards and KYC documents. Sources said that despite being non-existent or non-operational, many of the scrutinised institutions managed to get registered on both the National Scholarship Portal and the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE)."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a notorious criminal who had an Interpol Red Corner Notice against him since March 2016, has become the trigger for a feud between two nations . Accused of orchestrating armed terror training camps in Canada and training potential terrorists in operating prohibited bore assault rifles, Nijjar was shot dead by unidentified persons in Surrey in June. In his death, Nijjar found a surprising ally in Canada's Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. India has made repeated attempts to get Canada to take the Khalistani threat seriously. India has made repeated efforts to share intelligence and dossiers on Khalistani terrorists and their activities in Canada. But in the name of freedom of expression, no action was taken against these extremists, which in turn emboldened the Khalistani elements. Not just Canada, India has made other Western democracies, including the US, the UK, and Australia, aware of the growing activities of the Khalistanis on their soil. However, Canada is where the Khalistanis have found small pockets of backing. Are we to accept individuals like Gurpatwant Singh Pannun spewing venom against Hindus in Canada and urging them to leave the country? Is it acceptable for a tableau to depict the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and glorify her killers? Is it acceptable for photographs and details of Indian diplomats to be displayed publicly, effectively painting targets on their backs? Is it acceptable for Western democracies to shield terrorists and criminals despite the issuance of an Interpol notice against the accused? Canada’s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau appears to be trying to frame the situation as a ‘Canadian citizen’ being killed on Canadian soil, attempting to implicate Indian agents without sharing an iota of evidence. He is trying to rely on the concept of intelligence sharing among Five Eyes partner countries- Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. But it's crucial to remember that intelligence inputs are not irrefutable evidence. History has shown how intelligence inputs can lead to disastrous outcomes, as evidenced by the false claims of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that led to a destabilizing conflict and countless casualties. Let us look at the facts available in the terrorist Nijjar's killing case as of now: Yet, Justin Trudeau chose to lay blame on Indian agents based on vague intelligence inputs, even attempting to get the United States to put India under pressure. Seriously. The same US that: But this is not about name-calling or showing a mirror to self-styled liberal Western democracies. This issue is far more serious; it's about radical Khalistani terrorists exploiting Trudeau's administration and he, in turn, using partnerships with the US, the UK, and Australia, to target India. In the present case, the concerns are manifold: the Trudeau government's failure or refusal to act against Khalistani terrorists; these terrorists operating on Canadian soil to target India; open threats against Hindus in Canada; the safety of Indian diplomats in Canada; and terrorism and radicalization being passed off as freedom of expression. Unfortunately, Canada has a history of turning a blind eye to the activities of Khalistani terrorists. The 9/11 terror attacks, one of the worst aviation terror strikes, united the world against radical Islamist terrorism. In the aftermath, the United States first bombed Afghanistan, threatened to bomb Pakistan to stone age, and went ahead with a regime change in Iraq post 9/11. But India suffered its worst aviation terror strike in 1985 when Khalistani terrorists, based in Canada, targeted two Air India aircraft. The terror strike was planned in Canada. India gave written intelligence inputs to Canada. Air India Boeing 747 Kanishka flight AI 182 exploded mid-air, killing 329 innocent passengers and air crew on June 23, 1985. The bomb had been placed onboard the aircraft at Toronto's Pearson airport. Days before the bombing, on June 1, 1985, the Indian agencies sent out a telex to their Canadian counterparts, warning them that Air India flights could be targeted by Khalistani terrorists. The Canadian intelligence agencies were tracking Talwinder Singh Parmar, founder of terrorist organisation Babbar Khalsa International. Police followed him to the forested area where a trial blast was carried out before the bomb was planted on board the Air India 182 flight. Yet, the surveillance was called off. The Justice John Major Commission chronicled a series of unpardonable sins in Canada including: But these sins are not confined to a single tragic incident. The Khalistani terrorists attempted to plant another bomb on a flight from Vancouver to Japan's Narita International Airport. The suitcase with the bomb was to be transferred on Air India flight AI 301 from Japan to Bangkok. The Khalistani terrorists’ plan went awry when the bomb went off prematurely, killing Hideharu Koda and Hideo Asano, two Japanese baggage handlers at the Narita International Airport. Despite this, Canada failed to crack down on Khalistani elements. More than 300 people, including 20 pregnant women, were killed in the 1985 Kanishka bombing, yet Canada has allowed the Khalistani terror ecosystem to flourish within its borders. Western democracies, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, have often turned a blind eye to Khalistani activities, even when temples were targeted, and Indian missions and diplomats were attacked. The question we must ask is: Is this freedom of expression? Is terror freedom of expression? Western democracies must walk the talk and not provide cover fire to terrorists under the guise of freedom of expression. Hillary Clinton once warned Pakistan about \"snakes in the backyard,\" and these words could apply to Western democracies as well. Again. Being forewarned is to be forearmed. Beware!

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Lieutenant Colonel Amnon Shefler, spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), has confirmed that the IDF is prepared for ground operation in Gaza . In an exclusive interview with India Today TV near the Israel-Gaza border, Shefler said that the IDF was \"waiting for orders to enter the Gaza Strip and bring an end to Hamas' ability to carry out any kind of attack in the future\". The IDF has deployed 3,50,000 troops at both the northern and southern borders, ready to act on political directives, he said. He added that the primary objectives of these operations are twofold: to ensure the safe return of hostages currently held by Hamas and to carry out strategic operations within the Gaza Strip. Shefler's statements came amid humanitarian concerns in Gaza, where Israel has been conducting aerial strikes since the October 7 attacks. Speaking about Israel's strikes on Hamas targets, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner said, \"The IDF is currently engaged in three core components - still securing the area surrounding Gaza, making sure that the communities are no longer threatened by terrorists that potentially could still be in Israeli territory.\" \"The second component would be to rebuild and reconstruct the barrier itself as it was destroyed in several places over 20 points of infiltration,\" he further said as quoted by news agency ANI. \"The third component of our efforts is indeed focused on striking the terrorist infrastructure, the Hamas terrorist organisation that has built its hub for terrorism,\" he added. While Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other Middle East nations have called for de-escalation of the Israel-Hamas war . The US has expressed its full support for what it describes as \"Israel's right to defend itself.\" Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israeli security agency Shin Bet recently killed Ayman Nofal, a senior Hamas armed commander. The Hamas armed wing, Izz el-Deen Al-Qassam Brigades, confirmed Nofal’s death."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Spokesperson for Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Colonel Richard Hecht on Thursday said that the country was ready to fight a war on two fronts - with Hamas in Gaza in the south and with Hezbollah in Lebanon in the north. \"Of course, we can (fight). In the north, we have ramped up our defences. However, it wouldn't be smart for Lebanon to risk their future for Hamas,\" the Israeli army official told India Today TV. When asked about the current situation of Israel's operation against Hamas terrorists in Gaza, Colonel Richard Hecht said, \"We are striking Hamas leadership and infrastructure in Gaza and we have asked civilians to move to a safe zone.\" On whether Israel's ground operation in Gaza was delayed, the Israeli army official said, \"There is no delay, we are going to act in due course and in a very destructive way. We are ready to beat Hamas.\" Talking about whether Hamas terrorists were still present in Israel, the army official said that most of them had been killed. However, he added that there could still be some present in Israel as it's a war zone. In the early hours of Thursday, Israeli air strikes targeted two villages in southern Lebanon, Lebanese Al Mayadeen TV reported. The Israeli missiles were fired at Kafr Shuba and near Odaisseh, the channel added. On Wednesday, a hospital in Gaza was bombed , killing 471 people, as per the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. On the same day, Israel said it would allow Egypt to deliver limited quantities of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the decision was approved in light of a request from visiting US President Joe Biden. In a statement, it said it \"will not thwart\" deliveries of food, water and medicine, as long as the supplies do not reach Hamas. The war between Israel and Palestinian terrorist group Hamas began on October 7 when Hamas launched a series of rocket attacks on Israel, killing over 1,400 and infiltrated the country. This led to counterstrikes by Israel which are still ongoing."

In addition to the ongoing air raids, reports of clashes between the Israeli Forces and Hamas have also emerged on Sunday. Explaining the progress of the army's operations, IDF spokesperson Major David Barokh told India Today TV that Phase 1 of the Israeli military operation aims to decimate Hamas strongholds using air and artillery. This will be followed by a second phase to rid Gaza of Hamas. After eliminating Hamas men from Gaza, the Hamas leadership worldwide will be on notice, Major Barokh added. “We are targeting areas where Hamas is active. As we have stated, we are pursuing Hamas wherever they may be, and that is our current mission,\" Barokh said. Click here to get live updates of the Israel-Hamas war On tracing the Hamas leadership in Gaza, the IDF spokesperson said, \"We have intelligence; we know who the Hamas leadership is. We are building intelligence, even about those who have entered and committed these treacherous crimes against civilians”. “Even if it takes many days, months, or years, we are going to get the last one of them,\" Major Barokh affirmed. He further stated that the IDF's current focus is on 'dismantling Hamas's military capabilities so that the events that occurred here will not happen again.' He added, 'Afterwards, we will discuss other issues. Barokh also said that the army is fully prepared for a ground charge and is awaiting the order from Tel Aviv. \"If the government decides, we will go into Gaza; we are prepared to do so. We are ready on this front and on all other fronts,\" he said.\" Commenting on the military action in other parts of the country, including the West Bank, Major Barokh highlighted that Israel is currently in a “multi-front situation”. “Wherever we find Hamas, in Gaza or in Judea and Samaria (West Bank) we are going to take care of them,” he said. He added, “We are prepared here [south], we are prepared in the centre of the country and we are prepared in the north of the country”."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Israel's ambassador to India, Naor Gilon, on Monday said that despite Israel's attacks on Hamas targets in northern Gaza, it was trying to make sure civilians in the enclave receive humanitarian aid, in accordance with international law. While speaking to India Today TV, Gilon said, \"We are trying to answer the humanitarian needs of the people in Gaza, according to international law. We are trying to advise people to leave the main fighting areas in the northern parts to make sure civilians are not harmed. But Hamas is using people in Gaza as human shields.\" He further accused Hamas of stealing aid supplies from international organisations. When asked if Israel would consider a ceasefire in its war against Hamas, the Israeli ambassador said that there was no question of a pause or ceasefire in Gaza - a sentiment echoed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said a ceasefire would mean \"surrendering\" to Hamas. \"I don't think there is a reason to pause or bring a ceasefire now. We decided that after the October 7 attack which killed 1,400 people that the only way is to ensure that Hamas is neutralised so it doesn't have control of Gaza or the ability to attack again,\" Gilon explained. Talking about Israel's military goals in Gaza, he said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for eliminating Hamas' ability to control Gaza. Their second goal is to safely rescue Israelis taken hostage by Hamas on October 7. Reacting to Hamas leader Khaled Mashal's virtual address at a rally in Kerala, the Israeli envoy said that giving Hamas leaders a voice was \"morally problematic\". He further emphasised that although India has not officially listed Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has referred to it as one. When asked about the time-frame of how long Israel would take to achieve its military goals in Gaza, Gilon said there is no fixed time period but that they will continue to fight till they've won."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The massacre of 1,400 people in Israel by Hamas terrorists on October 7, 2023 stunned not just Israel but the entire free world. There was shock and anguish, but there was also outrage. The rape, murder, torture and killings were caught on camera. Body cams of Hamas terrorists, CCTV cameras on the streets in Sderot, Nova music festival site at Re’im, Kibutz Bee’ri, Kafer Azaa and multiple other settlements targeted by Hamas terrorists. An attack at this scale was unprecedented in Israel. And it was on television. But India has long suffered rape, loot, plunder and murder by radical Islamists. Qatl-e-Aam or mass murder of people of this land by radical Islamists has been a part of our history. From the Qatl-e-aam (mass massacre) ordered by Taimur Lang in 1398 to the Qatl-e-aam ordered by Nadir Shah in 1739, India has repeatedly suffered at the hands of foreign invaders. And not just in medieval times. While reporting from the Nova Music Festival at Re’im where Hamas terrorists massacred 300 of 3,000 music lovers and abducted a number of young women and men to Kibutz Bee’ri and Nahal Oz, I was reminded of a reporting assignment to Kashmir many years ago where the Baramulla Division Commander had taken me around to show me the place of loot, rape and plunder by Pakistan raiders and radical Islamists in 1947 in north Kashmir. The British were forced to leave India in 1947. On August 15, India won Independence but that victory came at a huge cost, with a section of Muslims demanding a separate country, Pakistan. India was split into three parts. But months after Independence, the Pakistan Army launched radical Islamists – tribal raiders into Kashmir. The raiders backed by the Pakistan army invaded Jammu and Kashmir on October 22, 1947 barely two months after Independence. Muzaffarabad fell and in 5 days Maharaja Hari Singh’s Army, heavily outnumbered and out gunned retreated to save Srinagar from falling into the Pakistan Army’s hands. The raiders reached Uri and Baramulla on October 24 and for the next three days the area saw rape, loot, plunder and arson. History was repeating itself. Contemporary accounts show the Pakistani raiders did not even spare the Catholic Mission, Church and hospital in Baramulla. On October 27, the raiders reached St Joseph’s hospital. The Catholic nuns and priests had been advised to abandon hospital days earlier and retreat to Srinagar, but they chose to stay behind, hoping the Pakistani raiders would show some humanity and not target a hospital tending to the ill – Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims and Christians. However, their hopes were dashed when hundreds of raiders reached Baramulla and unleashed forces from hell, indiscriminately raping and killing people. Women were abducted, homes looted and the raiders broke ranks and went back to Pakistan with looted gold, items and hundreds of women as spoils of war. Records in Baramulla show Lt. Col. Tom Dykes of the British Indian Army’s Sikh regiment who had stayed behind to bring back his family from Baramulla was shot and killed trying to save the Catholic nuns from the Pakistani raiders. His wife Biddy was shot dead trying as she rushed to her husband’s side. Father Jose Baretto, who tried to save the young nuns from being raped and killed by the Pakistani raiders, was caught and crucified on a tree outside the hospital and then shot by the raiders. The barbaric Pakistani raiders went from room to room in the hospital raping, abducting and killing all those who resisted. Motia Devi Kapoor, a patient at the hospital, too old to move, was stabbed through her heart. She died in bed. Philomena was shot trying to save patients. Sister Teresalina, a young Spanish nurse, was shot and killed trying to save Mother Aldetrude at the hospital. The Mother Superior, too, was targeted and shot at by the raiders but she survived. The rape, loot and plunder around Muzaffarabad, Uri and Baramulla continued for 3 days and several raiders from Pakistan’s North-west Frontier Province, instead of advancing to Srinagar as per Jinnah’s plans, returned to Pakistan with hundreds of abducted women and the loot. Contemporary accounts indicate that of the 14,000 inhabitants of Baramulla, only 1,000 lived to tell the tale. The others had either been killed, abducted or fled to Srinagar for safety. For Kashmir, the worst was in store. In 1988, Pakistan-backed radical Islamist terrorists started ethnic cleansing of minority Hindus in Kashmir. On September 14, 1989, Tika Lal Taploo, a Kashmiri Pandit advocate was killed in public to instill a sense of fear in minorities. In November, Neelkanth Ganjoo, a sessions Judge in Srinagar who had sentenced terrorist Maqbool Bhatt to death, was shot dead. On January 4, 1990, newspapers in Srinagar carried a message to minority Hindus to leave the valley. Armed terrorists enforced Islamic dress code and ordered a change of time to Pakistan Standard Time. In mid-January 1990, mosque loudspeakers were used to chant slogans asking Hindus to either convert to Islam or leave Kashmir and leave their women behind. On February 13, 1990, Lassa Kaul, Station Director of Srinagar Doordarshan was shot dead. On June 25, 1990, Girija tickoo, a Kashmiri Hindu from Bandipora who had left safely for Jammu was called back on the pretext of collecting her salary from the university in Kashmir. She was abducted, gang raped and then cut into pieces at a saw mill when still alive. BK Ganjoo, a young Kashmiri Hindu engineer in Kashmir, hid inside a rice container in their attic when armed terrorists came looking for him. Radical Islamist terrorists not only shot him inside that steel rice container but forced his wife to eat that blood-soaked rice. The Horror of Baramulla and other parts of Kashmir predates the Horror of Hamas in Israel, but the mind-set of the radical Islamist terrorists remains the same.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Times Square in the United States' New York City will live stream the mega consecration of Ram Temple scheduled to be held in Ayodhya on January 22, sources told India Today. Apart from its broadcast in all states of the country, the much-awaited ' Pran-Pratishtha' (consecration) of Ram Lalla will also be telecast at various Indian embassies overseas. On the historic occasion, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address all the Ram bhakts in India and abroad. Meanwhile, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has said that it will broadcast the consecration ceremony live at the booth level nationwide. According to news agency ANI , BJP workers have been instructed to set up large screens for the live telecast of the Shri Ram Consecration at the booth level. \"This way, the general public can have darshan of Shri Ram Lala and witness the consecration ceremony,\" the source told ANI. The vedic rituals for the Pran-Pratishtha ceremony of Ram Lalla (infant Lord Ram) are scheduled to commence on January 16, a week before the main ceremony. Sources said that PM Modi is closely monitoring the preparations for the ceremony and has also sought detailed information on the rituals and rules he is required to follow. On January 22, ahead of the Pran-Pratistha , PM Modi has committed to observing all religious protocols and procedures in reverence to the occasion. In an exclusive conversation with India Today TV, Ram temple construction committee chief Nripendra Mishra said that PM Modi has asked the Ram Mandir trust for any specific holy adhering that he has to abide by before he performs the Pran-Pratishtha . Meanwhile, a 51-inch tall Krishna Shila (Shyam Varn) idol of Lord Ram has been carefully chosen for the upcoming Pran-Pratishtha ceremony. The idol, resplendent in Shyam Varn (dark hue), is set to be a symbol of divinity, royalty, and the pure innocence of a child . Before undergoing the Yagopavit sanskar , the idol of Lord Ram will be showcased. The meticulously crafted idol is poised to be placed on a lotus-shaped platform within the Garbh Grah . Nripendra Mishra said the old Ram Lalla statue will be placed before new one , and it will be called \"Utsav Ram\". After January 16, both the statues will be placed in new Ram Mandir. Additionally, Lord Ram statue's eye cover will be opened by PM Modi on January 22."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) met Wednesday evening at the 7 Lok Kalyan Marg residence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and unanimously elected him leader of the alliance . Twenty-one leaders from 15 parties attended the meeting, where they acknowledged the NDA victory in the 2024 elections under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, and pledged to take forward his vision for a developed India (Viksit Bharat). The BJP at 240 is 32 short of the 272-mark in Lok Sabha. The NDA is comfortable at 293. However, this will be PM Narendra Modi’s first brush with a coalition government. He had a majority in his three tenures as Chief Minister of Gujarat and two tenures as Prime Minister. His detractors argue that with absolute majority, PM Modi is used to a certain style of functioning. They argue that in the past 10 years, his cabinet colleagues have often just rubber-stamped the Prime Minister’s decisions. But with the BJP now dependent on the TDP and JD(U) among other allies, will the Prime Minister have to change his style of functioning? Those who have worked closely with the Prime Minister insist he is result-oriented and adapts to every situation. India's stellar G20 presidency is a perfect example of the Prime Minister's ability to bring more than 20 heads of state and governments on the same page on extremely complex issues, from the Russia-Ukraine war to even India's tag line of Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam . “During India’s G20 presidency, extreme sensitivities and complex situations had to be kept in mind. There were many countries with disparate ideologies that had to be brought on the same page. Consultation was key. Our approach was consultative and conciliatory aimed at securing a satisfactory outcome. Mutual accommodation was key to this process,” Harsh Vardhan Shringla, Chief Coordinator for India's G20 presidency said. It is the same approach in dealing with a coalition, he believes. US President Joe Biden publicly shook hands with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the G20 Summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi bringing the two together for the India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor . Biden had faced criticism in the US for an earlier ‘fist bump’ with the Saudi Crown Prince after the Jamal Khashoggi incident. Getting them on the same page in New Delhi for a game-changer infrastructure initiative was essential and made global headlines. PM Narendra Modi spoke about it in an interview to ANI, saying, \"When you work for the global good and there are no personal ifs and buts, you can take the world on board. My effort was to raise the issue of why the G8 or G20 was started. Do not deviate from the stated aim and goals. And all leaders were convinced. If I had to speak to some leaders personally, I did so. If some leaders had an issue with terminology, they were convinced. Secondly, I was clear I will not postpone it (Joint Declaration) to the last day, last session. I will do it so quickly that everybody will be surprised. And that is why in the first session of the second day, we had the joint declaration. The aim was to keep the speculation and negativity out of the communication.” On getting US President Joe Biden and the Saudi Crown Prince to shake hands for cameras, PM Modi said, “India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEEC) will be a very major game-changer. It will have a big impact on the world for thousands of years. Gulf countries had a positive and pro-active role, India had an opportunity to play a positive role, US and Europe were with us and everyone thought there will be a positive outcome. We used to meet regarding this. And both Saudi King and US president are my friends. So I brought them together.” Those who have worked with the Prime Minister say he works towards a goal. “He sets a target and then attempts to achieve it. The aim is important and he works with his team to achieve that aim,” the official added. G20 is an example of how the Prime Minister can work with a coalition to achieve his aim. During G20, PM Modi and his team repeatedly reached out to the bloc’s heads of state to ensure the Russia-Ukraine war does not derail the declaration . India's G20 Presidency is also the perfect example of India's cooperative federalism. “To successfully host an exercise as extensive as the G20, we required the fullest cooperation of all state governments. The effort to involve all states and UTs came at the initiative of PM Modi even before we began our G20 presidency. A process of consultation and involvement of states as stakeholders in our G20 process delivered valuable dividends as our states participated actively in hosting G20 events on a pan-India basis,” Shringla added. The Prime Minister consulted every Chief Minister before and during the G20 presidency and all were invited to the G20 dinner. He held consultations with the African Union before bringing them on board. G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant and other officials emphasised India’s concerns to all interlocutors, insisting that development issues should not be eclipsed by the war. India first negotiated with the G7 countries and then separately with Russia and China on the final draft. It went down to the wire. At the final Sherpas’ meeting after multiple drafts of the declaration, Amitabh Kant told the other Sherpas: “This is the final draft. If anyone has any issues with this draft then your leader can take it up with my leader.” The draft had taken every country’s concern on board. PM Modi was very keen on a clean consensus with no footnotes, and ultimately every head of state came on board. But even before India’s G20 presidency, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was credited for being instrumental in ensuring a consensus at the G20 summit in Bali. US principal deputy national security advisor Jon Finer applauded PM Modi for being instrumental in forging a consensus during the G20 summit. “Looking around the world when the US and President Biden look for partners that can truly help carry the load, help move forward a global agenda, India and Prime Minister Modi are very high on the list,” Finer said. Prime Minister Modi had told Russian President Vladimir Putin at the SCO summit that this is not an era of war and “not an era of war” was a part of the Bali Declaration. Officials say India’s foreign policy reflects its ability to be friends with two countries that may be at odds with each other. “India has deftly handled ties both with US and Russia, Ukraine and Russia, US and Iran and that shows the Prime Minister’s diplomatic and political acumen. This will hold him in good stead in dealing with coalition partners too,” the official added. The Prime Minister is a tough negotiator. He was able to negotiate both with the US and Russia while keeping Indian interests supreme, be it on Russian oil or US technology. Similarly, he would be able to negotiate with alliance partners while keeping his party’s core interests safe. Taking back farm laws after intense protests by farmers and even land reforms indicate that despite being right, the Prime Minister takes a step back when required. He is extremely flexible and never takes a decision in haste. Every move, every decision is well thought out. That flexibility will be on test from June 9."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Here's what the ancient Tarot cards have to say about your Sun sign for this week: Aries (Mar 21 – Apr 19) Watch out for bouts of frustration and impatience. You may feel like success is evading you. Or promising projects just don’t take off. Work will pick up and prospects may develop, but it’s going to take time. For now, make do with a short-term strategy and don’t expect too much cooperation. In your personal life, expect relief with a joyful reunion of friends. Or the possibility of meeting someone new who will liven up your life with their sense of humour. Worrying about money isn’t going to help for now, just proceed in a step by step manner and remain optimistic. Taurus Apr 20 - May 20) Moderation is the key. Too much of a good thing may not be a good thing after all. Too many late nights. Or too much work may start to take a toll on your health. Take out time for self-care. And start delegating more. Friendships may begin to drain you. If you start feeling exhausted around a particular person or a group of people, perhaps it's time to investigate why and detach yourself for a while. Watch out for splurging on things you don’t really need. Or going overboard on food and drink. Bring back the balance. Gemini (May 21 - June 20) You’re on the right path. Remain hopeful and look forward to positive changes in the days ahead. A young soul may come bringing a message. Listen to your inner voice and follow its guidance. Geminis in creative fields have the potential to excel. And if you are planning to go overseas for higher studies, expect some good news as well. Spiritually, this is a period of growth. And it won’t come while you’re meditating but in the middle of conflict when you suddenly realise you can choose to react differently. A short getaway with family and friends recharges your batteries. Money matters look promising. Just don’t fall for any get-rich quick schemes. Cancer (June 21 – July 22) Imagination may be in overdrive. Or you may feel slightly off balance in certain situations or around certain people. There’s a restless, edgy vibe that can make you do things impulsively. Or begin to believe every negative thought. Time to detox and bring back the balance, especially if you discover you’re not sleeping too well or having unusual dreams. An intuitive woman may offer insights into a dilemma. Long-standing feuds have the potential to clear up. A good time to forgive and move on. Money matters require a practical approach. Jobseekers need to be aware of their market value. Leo (July 23 - Aug 22) Take charge. Start organising, delegating and doing whatever you need to get things done on time. Tempers may flare up suddenly, so do watch out for bouts of impatience. If there’s anything you cannot tolerate, it's excuses and lies. You may give a younger man a piece of your mind. Progress is made on the professional front. And at home, you may feel like decluttering or going in for a total makeover. Let go of attitudes and possessions you no longer need. Singles may find themselves attracted to someone who’s confident and outspoken. Finances show an upswing in the coming months. Just watch out for sudden aches and sprains. Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22) You may feel tired by life’s demands, or just overwhelmed by so much that’s going on. Slow down and take a break. Work matters may take a back seat as you focus on family matters or your own well-being. Businesses and projects may be delayed temporarily, or may need to be reworked. Long conversations with friends and family help bring perspective and a sense of clarity. You may not realise just how much you are loved and supported. Don’t neglect your health and de-stress as often as possible. Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22) Your future is entirely dependent on what you do now. Take control. Stand up against people who are trying to control you or just use you. A decision needs to be made very soon, but do take time out to weigh the pros and cons before taking the plunge. Your mind may want something, but your heart may desire something totally different. Even in relationships, you may find it hard to figure someone out. Or a loved one could leave you confused about their conflicting behaviour. A little more attention may be required in money matters, especially if you’ve been a little casual about your accounts of late. Health matters show progress. Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21) Pause. Figure out what’s truly important and focus on that. You may be doing too many things at once and not getting anything done. Workload may increase. Or you may find yourself doing the job of 2 people if you aren’t organised. Too many people depend on you and it may start to drain you. Make sure you get some me time. Singles may find themselves getting bogged down by someone else’s past baggage. Time for a heart-to-heart chat with loved ones about expectations and limitations. Money matters show a gradual upswing. A short holiday should help ease stress. Sagittarius (Nov 22 - Dec 21) It’s all about money, honey. And in the days ahead you may be focussing a lot on accounts and money matters. Expect payments, meetings around investments and even the possibility of making a large purchase. While you’re getting organised financially, don’t forget to touch base with those who love you. Your spouse may be a little demanding. Or a parent could need you for some emotional support. Singles may not feel like dating, or could be bored by someone’s attention. A good period to consider the changes you want to make in your life and then go ahead and change things. A new diet or lifestyle change brings the results you seek. Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19) Take your time to choose. There may be several paths to pick from, and they all may seem good on the surface. Focus on your priorities. Overcome negative thought patterns by visualising the best scenario in your mind. Capricorns in creative fields excel. Brainstorming with other fine minds brings the answers you seek. In matters of the heart, pay attention to the red flags. Someone’s indecisiveness or unwillingness to commit could mean it’s time to move on. Think about what you truly want from your personal relationships rather than pleasing everyone. Money that was owed to you may be delayed. Stay away from addictions and intoxicants. Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18) If you’re looking for peace, you may have to move away from all the people, places and things that are creating all the noise in your life. A toxic situation cannot be changed or wished away. A dominating or controlling coworker is not going to respond favourably to feedback. For now, begin to think of an alternative path. Even on the home front, someone may act too bossy or critical, and you may begin to avoid interactions until they back off a bit. The health of an elder may need a second opinion. Money matters require a lot more care when it comes to spending and saving. Expect success in legal matters, but do prepare to be patient. Pisces (Feb 19 - Mar 20) Time to break free from old patterns of behaviour and situations that do no good. Getting out of the comfort zone and trying something new, whether professionally or personally, could be the key to finding greater fulfilment and happiness in your life. There’s a growing restlessness that may be telling you that change is in your hands. If the same old friends are beginning to bore you, see how you can interact with new groups and try new things. A new fitness regime or diet will bring the positive changes you seek. Don’t delay. (Mita Bhan is a Tarot Reader and Holistic Healer)"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Aries (Five of Cups) Misunderstandings about your beloved may arise with a close friend. A dispute with a special person of a higher official in the workplace has become a cause of trouble. He may try to deprive you of several good opportunities. You may try to present your case to the higher official. The lack of good returns in the business at the moment is causing some anxiety. Trust in yourself and your deity. The result of hard work and patience will be positive. Taurus (Seven of Wands) You are working on the plan to start a new business. Something valuable may be lost or stolen. Stay alert. As you move forward, you should not expect support from anyone. You might have to face all the upcoming challenges with patience and restraint. Jealous colleagues in the workplace might conspire against you because of your praise. Rumors have been spread linking your name with a new person, which might make you lose interest in the workplace. You may look for a new job. Problems might increase due to not getting the desired promotion in the job. Gemini (Eight of Swords) Despite repeated wrongdoings by the other person, you do not take any action against him. People around are taking advantage of your compulsion. Maintain a distance from selfish people. Relationships where all efforts have been one-sided might come to an end. You will have to move forward with courage and bravery. There may be a delay in completing the work. Try to bring a change in your behavior. You might have to travel for an important task.

You might prepare to celebrate an achievement with family and friends. You will express gratitude to God for all the successes received. You may convince your beloved to marriage. Whatever you earn today, you will be happy with it. You will find yourself coming out of the disappointment that has been ongoing. The business that was incurring losses might gradually start showing profit. The desire to buy a property might be fulfilled. You will feel excited and joyful due to the success coming from all directions. Leo (Eight of Cups) There is hope that romantic relationships will improve again. The lack of good opportunities in the workplace is causing unrest in your mind. Negative thoughts have replaced positive ones in your mind. In a rush to move forward, you have come close to losing a good opportunity due to your own mistake. Repeating any mistake now can increase the problems further. The arrival of a new officer in the workplace may bring significant changes. Some new situations might be visible. Growing tension in a relationship can break it. Virgo (Five of Wands) There might be a dispute with family members regarding the fulfilment of your wishes. A job offer from abroad has impressed everyone. Family members are not in favor of sending you abroad. The desire to fulfil your dreams brings motivation to move forward. The result of hard work and dedication in the workplace for a long time may be achieved. Concern about unnecessary expenses in your sister's wedding might escalate the dispute. You should try to understand everyone. You might look for a new job. There is full hope of getting the desired job with a good salary increase.

Scorpio (Queen of Cups) Even after achieving success in business through hard work, you are not able to attain satisfaction. You are feeling a lack of something that others are unable to understand. You might turn towards spirituality for mental satisfaction. You have already planned a new task in your imagination. You will soon complete this imagination with your creativity and artistry. Humility and flexibility in behavior have always impressed everyone in the workplace. Until the work is completed to your satisfaction, you do not feel content. Due to this, many times, even after reaching close to success, you do not choose that path. Sagittarius (Nine of Swords) You might feel troubled by the difficulties in starting a business. Small obstacles are starting to look like big problems. Due to inexperience, you are unable to find ways to get out of these issues. Try to calm your mind. Try to control the turmoil of thoughts and solve the problem with patience and restraint. The advice of an experienced person can also work well. The problem is not as complicated as you are making it. Haste and lack of experience are preventing the completion of the work. You have all the necessary resources. They can be used to complete the work. You can share your tasks with others if needed. Because of your good behavior, people do not hesitate to help you. Capricorn (Two of Cups) Sudden changes might appear in life. Your behavior, which was previously rude and angry, is now gradually changing. Everyone is quite happy with this changed attitude. A higher official in the workplace, who has been quite impressed with your work efficiency and dedication, has proposed a partnership in their business. Although the business has just started and requires a lot of effort, you have gladly accepted this partnership proposal. Promotion in the job might be received. The beginning of a new relationship is filling the mind with happiness. You can feel a different kind of enthusiasm and joy in life. Aquarius (Three of Swords) Ignoring circumstances that have been appearing for a long time can affect the success of the work. You have ignored repeated warnings given by friends. As a result, you might face significant financial loss. The hope of promotion in the workplace seems to be diminishing. This is causing a lot of distress in your mind. Failing to present your case before higher officials might deprive you of promotion. Try to present your side. Due to the biased behavior of a colleague, you are planning to leave this job. Finding a new job is not that easy, which is increasing mental stress. A significant relationship from the past in a romantic relationship might bring trouble. Pisces (Nine of Cups) There have always been some problems disrupting life. Even in these circumstances, you have always maintained faith and belief in God. Soon, the favorable time for fulfilling all your desires is coming. Everything would seem like a miracle. Gradually, success in all tasks will begin. The mind will start feeling energized and enthusiastic. You might prepare for a trip. During this journey, meeting a stranger can provide new experiences. You might experience the joy of having a child. Students might be excited about their success. You should prepare to buy a new house."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Aries (Nine of Pentacles): Your financial situation might improve. Gradually, the time is becoming favorable. This is the time to fulfill your wishes. Circumstances are changing. Your business is starting to gain good momentum. You might receive news about a new job. You can make some good friends in your workplace. New opportunities are coming. In your job, you might get the desired promotion along with a salary increase. Both pieces of news are exciting. Family and friends are all very happy about this success. Despite all this, you don't feel as happy as you might have with this success. Your mind is gripped by some unknown apprehension. It is possible that this apprehension will prove to be baseless. Wedding preparations in the family might begin in full swing. Taurus (Five of Swords): You might find yourself in the company of some people who are quite cunning and selfish. Because of this, your loved ones are unable to trust you. There could be badmouthing behind your back at the workplace. You are surrounded by negativity on all sides. Everyone might try to take advantage of your simple nature. Changing your location at this time would be better for you. You will have to make efforts for yourself and move forward. A promotion in your job might come with a transfer. It will be good to seize the opportunity for a better future and move away from your current work environment. Control your anger and speech. Try to achieve success with patience and restraint. Avoid using harsh words with others. It’s better to stay silent in situations where disputes might escalate. The difficult situations in your workplace/business should not become so overwhelming that you resort to unethical means to complete your work. Gemini (The Emperor): After much hard work, you are now approaching success. Just one final effort can greatly aid in achieving this success. Your humble behavior and good personality have always impressed people. By utilizing your qualifications and abilities, you might plan to start a new business by engaging in new creative activities. It is time to work with full strength without stopping. Your higher officials may praise your work efficiency and honesty, and they also respect your capabilities. In romantic relationships, spending more time can bring strength and novelty. You should not be overly dependent on anyone. If needed, take a little help, but success will come only when you take the initiative and take responsibility for the work yourself. Relying on others to complete your tasks is not a wise approach. Cancer (Two of Swords): The turmoil in your thoughts might make it difficult to make a decision. Choosing the better option between two situations can seem challenging. You might have two good job opportunities in front of you. Both opportunities are quite good, but you are unable to decide on the right job. Control your thoughts. Try to make the right decision by observing the surrounding circumstances impartially. Trust that the decision you make will be the right one. There might be some upheaval in your business. Do not get disturbed; face the problem fearlessly. Try to bring better momentum to your business again. When no solution to the problem seems clear, look within yourself. You might find the solution to the problem there. Leo (Ten of Swords): The long-standing problems have brought a lot of irritability into your behavior. Anger and stress are increasing, and you might feel difficulty in controlling yourself. Opponents in the workplace have created situations to undermine you, making you feel quite helpless. You can decide to face these problems head-on. Someone close to you has betrayed you significantly, and the worry about how to get out of these troubles is unsettling your mind. Despite how difficult the problems may be, you have decided to confront them. You have resolved to overcome these circumstances. Any extremely difficult situation, thoughts, or people who are not good for you will now naturally start moving away from your life. Soon, good opportunities will start coming in your work as well. Your financial situation will also begin to improve. You just need to maintain trust in yourself and your faith. Virgo (Seven of Pentacles): The dissatisfaction stems from not receiving rewards commensurate with your success at work. You have left no stone unturned in your hard work and effort, yet the results have not met your expectations. You might soon start working on a plan to begin a new project. You have worked hard to complete your tasks in the past, but achieving better results will require long-term planning and better coordination. You might be preparing to move from your old house to a new, bigger one. Enhance your own work skills. As you strive to reach the pinnacle, challenges increase significantly, so it's better to be prepared in advance. To ensure a better future, strengthen and improve your present. The appreciation of your hard work and efforts by higher officials inspires you to move forward with new enthusiasm and passion. Libra (Three of Pentacles): Due to a lack of experience in completing tasks properly, you are encountering some obstacles. Because of your inexperience, you might have to hear a lot from higher officials regarding your work. Seeking advice from an experienced person will be beneficial for completing your work correctly. In starting a new phase of life, the support of elderly family members will help in maintaining balance. Arrogance and pride do not help in connecting with people. You might be planning to enter into a partnership in a new business. As you are new and inexperienced in this business, try to find an experienced partner. Control your anger. Avoid getting into arguments over trivial matters. It is important to give importance to your own perspective but also to have the ability to listen to the other person's point of view. Scorpio (Three of Swords): You might notice a sudden change in the behavior of a loved one. Despite your significant efforts to help them succeed in life, they might be moving away from you to start anew. Suddenly, selfishness seems to be creeping into relationships. Disputes over property among family members may escalate. An outsider might exploit your trust and plan to deceive you. This betrayal can leave you feeling quite disheartened. In the workplace, there might be disagreements with colleagues regarding a promotion. Jealous colleagues might try to create obstacles in your path to promotion. It may feel as though you have never truly understood anyone. Soon, the time will become favorable for you. Before trusting someone, think it through carefully. Avoid placing excessive trust in anyone. Sagittarius (The Hermit): The difficult situations you have faced in the past have left you feeling quite lonely. It is necessary to come out of this loneliness. Try to give your work a new identity. Make an effort to distance yourself from those envious people surrounding you. You might feel a spiritual inclination, with your faith and trust in God becoming stronger than before. You may feel very excited about your children, as they have achieved significant accomplishments in their education. A big celebration might be planned. Try to stay away from bad habits and cultivate the habit of completing tasks on time. This is a time for self-reflection, reviewing all your actions and mistakes. This will help you achieve success in future endeavors. Capricorn (The Star): Some good opportunities might soon come your way. Selecting the right opportunity and striving for advancement in life can lead to success. Balancing mental and physical health will prove beneficial. You might feel trapped in your work environment, unable to use your full potential. The double nature of people may gradually become apparent, which can be quite hurtful. Maintaining a certain relationship may feel burdensome, and distancing yourself from it could be beneficial for both parties. You believe that God will surely listen to your prayers and will soon show you a way to live your life better. You are preparing yourself for all kinds of changes. Your faith and trust in God are becoming stronger. You might experience positivity in life. News about a new job might come your way, possibly with the good news of a desired promotion and salary increase. You are working on a new plan, carefully reviewing all its important aspects. Aquarius (The Fool): The passion for embracing new ideas and initiatives can inspire you to move forward. Soon, there may be opportunities in your work sphere to soar high and seize the chance to make decisions wisely. Rushing into any decision hastily can create obstacles in achieving good success. You should strive to strengthen your thoughts by reducing a bit of restlessness in your nature. Your family, friends, and colleagues have always motivated you to progress. Ignoring the words of your loved ones may not always prove beneficial. Avoid interfering when others make decisions for themselves. Do not overlook the risks that may come in your work or business. It's possible that you haven't paid attention to a warning. Pisces (Nine of Cups): In business, a financial problem that was emerging has been resolved with the help of a friend's financial assistance. Soon, you may be able to restart your business. The upcoming time is full of desires being fulfilled. The wish for offspring of childless couples could also be fulfilled. The path to fulfilling all desires will gradually open up, which can be quite encouraging. A new change is coming in life, and everything could be better than before. God may bless you with happiness. The search for a job could be successful. There is a possibility of a festive event in the family. The family atmosphere is filled with enthusiasm. You have been trying hard for a long time to buy a new house, but for some reason, this wish hasn't been fulfilled yet. Now, there is a possibility that this wish will also be fulfilled. Gradually, all desires are likely to be fulfilled."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Among the major upsets that the BJP suffered in West Bengal was that of its north Bengal face Nisith Pramanik, who, according to Election Commission sources, lost the Cooch Behar seat to TMC’s Jagadish Chandra Basunia by over 39,000 votes. With Pramanik’s defeat in Cooch Behar, the TMC managed to open its Lok Sabha account in the region north of the Malda Dakshin seat which had, as per results of the 2019 parliamentary polls, remained a BJP stronghold. A former Trinamool Congress youth leader who joined the BJP following his expulsion after the 2018 panchayat polls in Bengal, Pramanik stunned his nearest TMC rival Paresh Adhikary with a winning margin of over 54,000 votes in the 2019 general elections. The current election results reveal that Pramanik was at the receiving end of a significant vote swing in favour of the TMC in the Cooch Behar constituency, where the BJP continues to hold five of the seven assembly segments in its jurisdiction. Pramanik went down to Basunia, the TMC’s face of the Rajbanshi community and the sitting MLA of the Sitai assembly segment. For the 38-year old politician, who has had a total experience of three years serving as a Union Minister of state in the home ministry and the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs, Pramanik established himself as a key leader for the BJP, not just in Cooch Behar but in entire north Bengal where the saffron party has significant stakes. In 2021, Pramanik earned the distinction of becoming the youngest member of Narendra Modi’s council of ministers, following a reshuffle in the Union cabinet. That year during the state polls, Pramanik’s 57-vote hairline victory margin over his arch rival TMC’s Udayan Guha from the Dinhata assembly segment seemingly convinced the leader to fall back to his position in Parliament, instead of moving to the state assembly. Guha wrested the segment from the BJP by a thumping majority in the by-polls held two years later. In his nomination affidavit, Pramanik declared that he has 14 criminal cases pending against him, nine of which were registered between 2018 and 2020, the years following his jumping ship to the BJP. The cases range from attempted murder and rioting to house trespass and unlawful assembly. In January this year, the Jalpaiguri Circuit Bench of the Calcutta High Court granted anticipatory bail to Pramanik in an attempt to murder case lodged against him in 2018."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) fielded several Union Ministers for the 2024 elections. While many of them won the polls to return to Parliament, several others, including big names, lost the battle. Among the notable winners were Nitin Gadkari, who secured the Nagpur seat with a substantial margin, and Anurag Thakur, who triumphed in Hamirpur for the fifth consecutive time. Other significant victories included Sarbananda Sonowal's win in Dibrugarh, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat's success in Jodhpur, and Amit Shah's victory in Gandhinagar. Smriti Irani in Amethi stands in the front row of Union Ministers who failed to touch the magic number. Rajeev Chandrasekhar's defeat in Thiruvananthapuram, Arjun Munda's loss in Khunti, Mahendra Nath Pandey's defeat to the Samajwadi Party's Birendra Singh in Chandauli, and Ajay Mishra Teni's loss in Lakhimpur Kheri are other prominent faces who could not win."

Others, including regional outfits and Independents, won 16 seats. Besides a possibly lower seat count, the NDA is also facing a reduced vote share.

Baramati turned in a hot seat after state Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar pitted his wife, Sunetra Pawar, against his cousin, Supriya Sule. The Election Commission data showed that Pawar won the seat by a margin of over 1.5 lakh. Sule received 7,32,312 votes, while Sunetra Pawar managed to bag 5,73,979 votes, the poll panel's data showed. Baramati, which is considered a strong-hold seat of the Pawar family, had earlier also elected the state's veteran leader Sharad Pawar six times. In the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, his daughter Supriya Sule received as many as 48,000 votes from the Baramati Assembly seat, which is currently represented by Ajit Pawar. After Ajit Pawar broke away from his uncle Sharad Pawar's party and merged his side with the ruling Shinde Sena-BJP government, the party's traditional symbol was also given to his NCP faction. In Maharashtra, the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance faced a setback as the INDIA bloc won eight seats and was leading on another 17 of the 48 Lok Sabha constituencies. After the results, Ajit Pawar said that his party would introspect to find out the reasons for the bleak performance in the Lok Sabha polls. \"The NCP and Mahayuti alliance could not get the expected success in Maharashtra, but we have the power to change the picture,\" said Ajit Pawar who split the Sharad Pawar-led NCP last year and joined the Shiv Sena-BJP government in the state. \"I congratulate Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the NDA has crossed the required majority number in the parliament,\" he added in a message on X."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The BJP, which had dominated the last three Lok Sabha elections in Jharkhand, faced a significant setback on Tuesday in the state's five tribal constituencies - Khunti, Singhbhum, Lohardaga, Rajmahal, and Dumka. The ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM)-led alliance won all five seats, performing particularly well in Singhbhum, Rajmahal, and Dumka. Despite the BJP's campaign focusing on corruption, including ED and CBI raids on former Jharkhand CM and JMM executive president Hemant Soren, as well as law and order issues, the JMM succeeded in galvanising tribal sentiments by highlighting perceived injustices against Soren. The Congress secured victories in Khunti and Lohardaga constituencies. In Khunti, Union minister and incumbent MP Arjun Munda suffered a resounding defeat, losing to Congress's Kalicharan Munda by 1.49 lakh votes, according to the Election Commission. Similarly, in Lohardaga, Congress's Sukhdeo Bhagat defeated BJP's Samir Oraon by 1.39 lakh votes. In Singhbhum, JMM's Joba Majhi won by a substantial margin of 1.68 lakh votes, defeating BJP's Geeta Kora, the wife of former Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda, who had joined the BJP just before the Lok Sabha elections. In Rajmahal, JMM's Vijay Hansdak won by 1.78 lakh votes, defeating BJP's Tala Marandi. In Dumka, JMM's Nalin Soren narrowly defeated BJP's Sita Soren by 22,527 votes in a closely contested race. Sita, a three-time JMM legislator, had joined the BJP shortly before the elections, causing discontent among the party's ranks. The BJP had initially announced sitting MP Sunil Soren as their candidate but later replaced him with Sita Soren. In 2019, the BJP had won the Khunti and Lohardaga seats, while Singhbhum was won by Congress, Dumka by BJP, and Rajmahal by JMM. A vigorous campaign was led by INDIA bloc leaders, including AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi, and Kalpana Soren, the wife of jailed former Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren, credited with revitalizing the JMM. Elections were held in Singhbhum, Khunti, and Lohardaga on May 13, while Dumka and Rajmahal voted on June 1. Of the 14 Lok Sabha seats in the state, six are reserved for SC and ST candidates. The opposition INDIA bloc leveraged the arrest of former CM Hemant Soren, a tribal community member, to play the victim card. Insiders suggest that infighting within the BJP also contributed to their poor performance. In 2019, the NDA won 12 out of 14 seats in the state, with Congress and JMM each securing one seat. Jharkhand Chief Minister Champai Soren credited the INDIA Bloc's success in the tribal seats to overwhelming public support. He stated, \"The way you have supported the Alliance candidates despite false allegations and propaganda is significant for us. They (BJP) tried to suppress our voice but failed.\""

Waikar, the MLA from Jogeshwari East seat in suburban Mumbai, had switched over from the opposition Shiv Sena (UBT) to Chief Minister Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena earlier this year and his candidature from the Lok Sabha constituency was announced at the last minute. Trends showed both the candidates leading at different times during the counting of votes. At one point Kirtikar was leading by just one vote. Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray said he suspects there was something \"fishy\" in the counting process and added his party was contemplating to challenge the result."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Election Commission of India on Tuesday declared results for all the 543 Lok Sabha seats that went to the polls from April 19 to June 1, which showed BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) fell short of expectations in the face of a surprisingly strong show by the Opposition INDIA bloc. The BJP secured 240 seats, falling short of the majority mark of 272, while the Congress won 99. As the BJP fell short of a majority in the Lok Sabha, needing NDA allies to form the government at the Centre, Bihar Chief Minister and JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar and TDP's N Chandrababu Naidu emerged as potential kingmakers. Chandrababu Naidu's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) won 16 Lok Sabha seats while Nitish Kumar's JD(U), won 12 seats in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, respectively, the election commission data showed. With 28 seats between them, N. Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar hold the balance of the BJP-led National Democratic alliance (NDA) in their hands. Both parties have re-pledged their allegiance to the NDA and will be present at the alliance’s meeting scheduled for Wednesday. 2 COALITION-ERA VETERANS EMERGE KINGMAKERS Nitish Kumar's relationship with the BJP goes back to the mid-1990s when he had collaborated with veteran socialist leader late George Fernandes to float the Samata Party, as a revolt against Lalu Prasad, the then chief minister of Bihar, who had acquired an overbearing presence in the Janata Dal founded by former prime minister V P Singh, according to PTI. The alliance with BJP, which ruled the country from 1998 to 2004, also provided much-needed exposure to Kumar, who held key portfolios like agriculture, railways and surface transport in the cabinet of late Atal Bihari Vajpayee. It was in 2005 that Nitish Kumar's party, now known as JD(U), was formed after the merger of the Samata Party with yet another rebel Janata faction headed by late Sharad Yadav. The JD(U)-BJP combine won the assembly polls, and Nitish Kumar became the chief minister, a post held by Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi for 15 years. Coming back to today's scenario, Nitish’s party, amid flip-flop-flip situation , has emerged as the single-largest entity in Bihar despite contesting only 16 seats, despite the other two big parties, RJD and BJP, having fielded more candidates. Meanwhile, Chandrababu Naidu's TDP also put up a good show in the Lok Sabha polls, winning 16 of the total 25 seats in the state, with allies BJP and Janasena Party ahead in three and two constituencies respectively. Naidu has also emerged as a possible kingmaker, being the second-largest party in the ruling NDA alliance behind the BJP. On September 9, 2023, he was arrested in the skill development scam case by the YSRCP government, the lowest point in his political career. Naidu spent nearly two months in the Rajamahendravaram central jail. However, an interim bail on October 31, which was made absolute on November 20, set Naidu free to prepare for the 2024 polls, enabling him to join the BJP-led NDA alliance along with Janasena."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Opposition INDIA bloc have planned marathon meetings in Delhi today to discuss the formation of a new government at the Centre following the completion of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The NDA meeting has ended. Home Minister Amit Shah, TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, and JDU leaders Lallan Singh and Sanjay Jha, were among those present at the meeting. The INDIA bloc meet is scheduled to take place at around 6 pm. According to the final results declared by the Election Commission of India on Wednesday, the BJP won 240 seats, falling short of the majority mark of 272, while the Congress secured 99. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to form a government at the Centre for a third consecutive term despite his NDA falling short of expectations in the face of a surprisingly strong showing by the INDIA bloc, as well as crushing losses in key states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. The 2024 results were a far cry from the 303 and 282 seats the BJP-led NDA had won in 2019 and 2014, respectively, to have a majority on its own. Ahead of leaving for the national capital to attend the NDA meeting on a new government formation, TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu said, \"Today, I am heading to Delhi. After the completion of the election, this is my first press meet before going to Delhi. I am very glad for the support of the voters. Ups and downs are common in politics. Many political leaders and parties have been ousted in history. This is a historic election. Even voters from abroad have returned to their hometowns to exercise their votes.\" Tejashwi Yadav told reporters in Patna, \" Our performance has been very good. We based our contest on issues. Lord Ram blessed the INDIA bloc in Ayodhya. So, it is very clear that the 'Modi factor' is finished. The BJP is far away from the majority. It is now dependent on allies. We are happy that we have been successful to a great extent in safeguarding the Constitution.\" #WATCH | Patna, Bihar: When asked if they are trying to have an INDIA alliance Government at the Centre, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav says, \"We will keep trying.

While responding to a query on whether RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav were in touch with Nitish Kumar, Jha said, \"Those who need to contact him are talking to him. Our leader Tejashwi Yadav has been saying for some time that Nitish Kumar will take a big decision around June 4.\" Chandrababu Naidu, who is set to become the next Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister following his thumping victory in the general elections, thanked PM Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda \"for their commitment to Andhra Pradesh's future\". \"I thank the people of our state for blessing the TDP-JSP-BJP alliance with an overwhelming mandate to serve them. Together, we have won a battle to reclaim our state, and together, we will rebuild it,\" he tweeted. Andhra Pradesh has won! The people of Andhra Pradesh have won!

Top leaders of the BJP and its other allies, who are likely to be in attendance, are also expected to congratulate Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is set for a record third term in office. Meanwhile, the INDIA bloc meeting which will take place at around 6 pm in the national capital will be attended by top opposition leaders, including Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin, NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar and party leader Surpiya Sule. Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh told Aaj Tak, India Today's sister channel, that the INDIA bloc's decision to meet and discuss a government formation was the BJP's defeat. \"The bloc's biggest party, Congress, has made it clear that a strategy on attempts to form the government will be decided in today's meeting. I can't say who is speaking to the TDP chief. In 2019, Chandrababu Naidu gathered the opposition parties against the BJP on the issue of federalism. Nitish Kumar was the one who initiated efforts to form the INDIA Bloc. JDU MLAs were poached in the northeast by the BJP. Hope the JDU and TDP will keep these issues in mind when they take a final call,\" he added. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut said there would be no objection if Congress MP Rahul Gandhi was ready to accept the leadership of the opposition. \"He is a national leader and has proved himself. He is popular. We all love him. In the INDIA alliance, there is no difference of opinion on who will be the Prime Minister,\" he told reporters. #WATCH | Mumbai: On whether Rahul Gandhi is the PM face of the INDIA alliance, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut says, \"If Rahul Gandhi is ready to accept the leadership, why would we object?

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The biggest leaders often emerge from the worst crisis. That is the story of 41-year-old Nara Lokesh, a leader who has been forged by fire. After being reduced to just 23 seats in the 2019 Andhra Pradesh Assembly election, many political experts said it was a dead end for the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and its leader N Chandrababu Naidu. Naidu's son, Nara Lokesh -- an MBA from Stanford -- was 36 then. The massive political jolt delivered by a rising YSRCP, was seen as the greatest crisis faced by the TDP and the 'Kingmaker' Chandrababu Naidu, in the last few decades. Five years later, the TDP is winning 135 seats in the 2024 Andhra Pradesh assembly polls, and its chief N Chandrababu Naidu is set to be sworn in as the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister for the third time. The TDP's alliance partners, Pawan Kalyan-led Jana Sena Party, bagged 21 seats, while the BJP won eight, taking the NDA's total to a staggering 164, in the 175 member house. While many are crediting Naidu's smart pre-poll alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Pawan Kalyan's Jana Sena Party (JSP) for the historic win, the role of TDP leader Nara Lokesh is too big to be overlooked. Often undermined in the past as unprepared and raw, Nara Lokesh seems to have finally come of age. He is being seen as the victory bearer for the TDP's return to power, after it was dethroned by the YSRCP in 2019. The massive TDP-JSP-BJP win is being credited to the rise of Nara Lokesh and the blood and sweat he has put in for the win. Reels and shorts on social media are hailing Nara Lokesh's contributions with the titles, \"Nara Lokesh, The Future of AP and TDP\" and \"The Raise Of LN Naralokesh\". The 41-year-old, once discredited by his own partymen, has finally emerged from his father's shadow. Nara Lokesh, since his personal defeat in the Mangalagiri seat and the 2019 debacle, which coincided with the TDP loss in the state, has made significant strides in Andhra Pradesh politics. As the TDP bounced back in the 2024 Assembly election in Andhra Pradesh, Nara Lokesh won the Mangalagiri seat by a margin of 91,000 votes. A sweet comeback. Nara Lokesh defeated his nearest rival, YSRCP candidate Murugudu Lavanya. (Image: X/NaraLokesh) As the TDP's General Secretary, experts believe, Nara Lokesh has been instrumental in shaping the party's strategy and policies. His efforts, including a massive membership drive and a 400-day padyatra, have positioned him as a key figure in the election campaign and the subsequent win. In January 2023, Nara Lokesh embarked on the Yuva Galam Padayatra (Voice of the Youth), a 400-day journey covering 4,000 kilometres from Kuppam to Ichchapuram. This ambitious foot march was aimed at connecting with the youth of Andhra Pradesh and taking the TDP's vision to the grassroots for the state's development. The padyatra served as a platform for Nara Lokesh to engage with citizens, listen to their concerns, and articulate the party's policies and goals. During the Yatra, every time a person spelt out the problems she/he faced, Lokesh would keenly jot them down on a piece of paper. He would often hug elderly women, take selfies with the younger lot, engage in casual friendly banter, and call out the younger men as ‘tammudu’ (younger brother) and the elderly as ‘Anna’ (elder brother). \"I am sure the time he [Nara Lokesh] spent on the road would have brought him closer to seeing and feeling the real problems of people. Many more miles to goâæ,\" N Chandrababu Naidu posted on X, on completion of 100 days of the yatra. He walked 28,000 steps on average, every day, according to an opinion piece by senior journalist TS Sudhir for IndiaToday.In. Just like the Bharat Jodo Yatra changed the popular perception of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, the Yuva Galam padyatra has helped to rebrand Nara Lokesh in more ways than one, according to TS Sudhir. Lokesh's leadership qualities came to the fore when his father, Chandrababu Naidu, was arrested and imprisoned in connection with the multi-crore skill development corporation scam. He halted the padayatra, assumed control of the party, and looked after the TDP. He even chaired the politburo meeting to take up state-wide agitations against the alleged illegal arrests of his father. He went to New Delhi to discuss with senior lawyers of the Supreme Court to fight his father's case. Following Chandrababu's release in October, Lokesh resumed his padayatra, and gained the acknowledgement as the No. 2 in the TDP. Nara Lokesh attacked Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and YSRCP chief Jagan Mohan Reddy on corruption cases and non-fulfillment poll promises, and even called him 'Psycho Jagan'. Years before the Yatra, Nara Lokesh, the Stanford MBA, had led a successful party membership drive, which added over five million members to the ranks of the TDP. The drive utilised innovative digital technology, including tablets, live data feeds, and a real-time dashboard. The drive marked the first such use of technology by a political party in India, for enroling and managing party members. \"For the first time ever in the country, we are using messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram to make enrolment easy and hassle-free,\" Nara Lokesh posted on X. These achievements not only cemented Nara Lokesh as an efficient political organiser but also demonstrated his ability to leverage technology for political mobilisation. A long walk from being called a \"back office boy\". However, Lokesh had not been an alien to politics. He had been a key figure in the TDP's leadership even before the 2019 debacle. Lokesh, as an MLC, held the position of Minister for IT, Panchayati Raj, and Rural Development in the Chandrababu Naidu cabinet between 2017 and 2019. His induction drew criticism as well, as he was not directly elected by the people and was a member of the Legislative Council, not the assembly. His induction to the top was seen as a smooth sail. Nara Lokesh has also been involved in development initiatives, including the NTR Memorial Trust, which works on healthcare, education, skills enhancement, and disaster management. The TDP, which broke ties with the BJP and opted out of the NDA before the 2019 Assembly polls after having joined hands with the BJP before the 202 polls, has seen Lokesh as a strong advocate for the TDP-BJP alliance. In an interview with India Today, Lokesh had expressed confidence that the TDP-BJP alliance would form the government in Andhra Pradesh, with the TDP winning a majority of seats. Lokesh's prediction has finally become a reality. With the win, Nara Lokesh has not only cemented himself at the top, he has also given a befitting reply to his critics, who once labelled him as the 'Andhra Pappu'. \"The post-yatra Lokesh is very different from pre-yatra Lokesh,\" is what Nara Lokesh said after the completion of his Yatra, and this is what encapsulates the Youth leader's coming of age."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The 2024 Lok Sabha election results threw up some surprises as the Opposition INDIA bloc defied exit poll predictions and performed better than expected and prevented the BJP, which was predicted to win an outright majority, from crossing the 300-mark. However, the election also resulted in four candidates, who are all 25 years old, being elected to Parliament. The four GenZ MPs, Pushpendra Saroj, Priya Saroj, Shambhavi Choudhary and Sanjana Jatav are set to become the youngest MPs in the 18th Lok Sabha. While Pushpendra Saroj and Priya Saroj contested on a Samajwadi Party (SP) ticket, Shambhavi Choudhary and Sanjana Jatav are from Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and Congress, respectively. 1. Pushpendra Saroj - A Samajwadi Party (SP) member, Pushpendra Saroj won Uttar Pradesh's Kaushambi Lok Sabha seat, defeating sitting BJP MP Vinod Kumar Sonkar by a margin of 1,03,944 votes. He is the son of Inderjit Saroj, the national general secretary of SP, a five-time MLA and former Uttar Pradesh Minister. Notably, Inderjit Saroj had lost this seat to Sonkar in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Pushpendra Saroj took the plunge into politics after completing his B.Sc. in Accounting and Management from Queen Mary University of London. 2. Priya Saroj- The 25-year-old also fought the 2024 Lok Sabha elections on an SP ticket in Uttar Pradesh's Machhlishahr seat. She defeated sitting BJP MP Bholanath by a margin of 35,850 votes. Priya Saroj's father, Toofani Saroj, is a three-time MP. 3. Shambhavi Choudhary - Contesting on a LJP ticket, Shambhavi Choudhary emerged victorious in Bihar's Samastipur constituency and defeated Congress's Sunny Hazari, the son of Janata Dal (United) Minister Maheshwar Hazari, by a margin of over one lakh votes. Shambhavi Choudhary, who earlier harboured aspirations to join politics, is the daughter of Ashok Choudhary, who is a part of the Nitish Kumar-led cabinet in Bihar. Ashok Choudhary had recently to the JD(U) from the Congress. Shambhavi Choudhary's grandfather, late Mahavir Choudhary, was also a part of the Congress and served as a state minister when the grand old party was in power in Bihar. 4. Sanjana Jatav - Sanjana Jatav, a Congress candidate, won the Bharatpur seat in Rajasthan, defeating BJP's Ramswaroop Koli by a margin of 51,983 votes. She tried her luck in last year's assembly polls in Rajasthan but marginally lost to Ramesh Khedi of the BJP by only 409 votes. #WATCH | Rajasthan: Congress candidate from Bharatpur constituency, Sanjana Jatav celebrates her victory.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The remarkable turnaround by the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance in Uttar Pradesh, where they won 43 of the 80 seats, was not just sheer coincidence but was down to a host of factors like ticket distribution, PDA (pichada, Dalits, alpsahkhyaks or minorities) outreach, and anger among the Rajput community . Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party emerged as the single-largest party in Uttar Pradesh, winning 37 seats, up from the five it won in 2019. It played a key role in reducing the ruling BJP's tally to 33 seats from the 62 it won in the 2019 polls. It also prevented the BJP from reaching the majority mark of 272 on its own. The Congress, which won just a solitary seat in 2019, bagged six seats this time, while Mayawati's BSP failed to open its account this time. But, what led to the churn in the Uttar Pradesh political scenario? We explain the development in five graphics. A region-wise analysis shows that the Samajwadi Party secured gains in the western, central and eastern parts of the state. Interestingly, the party also won three seats in Bundelkhand, which was dominated by the BJP in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The Samajwadi Party gained the maximum number of seats in eastern UP at 18, followed by six seats in the Jat-dominated western belt. The BJP's decline in eastern UP is surprising since Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath represent Varanasi and Gorakhpur, both of which fall in the eastern region. The Congress also gained two seats in the eastern region, while the BJP was pegged back by 13 seats. The BJP won 28 seats and 24 seats out of the total 32 in eastern Uttar Pradesh in 2014 and 2019 respectively. The INDIA bloc also made massive gains in the politically sensitive western region, gaining seven seats. The BJP, on the other hand, lost six seats despite getting Jayant Chaudhary's Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) on board. In this region, out of the 26 seats, the NDA has won only 13 seats. In 2019, its tally was 18. In the first phase, the INDIA bloc nearly swept all the seats, winning five of the eight. The NDA got only two seats. The trouble signs for the BJP were visible ahead of the polls due to a rebellion by Rajputs who have traditionally voted for the saffron party. The anger among the Rajputs, who constitute around 10-13% of the state population, had been simmering for some time as the community perceived that it was being sidelined within the BJP. The anger compounded as they were sidelined in ticket distribution at the expense of Gurjars and Jats. In fact, the BJP fielded only one Rajput candidate, Kunwar Sarvesh Singh, in the eight constituencies that voted in the first phase. Singh, however, died a day after the polls. The remaining eight constituencies in the western belt saw no Rajput representation by the BJP. Another major factor that worked in favour of the Samajwadi Party was its ticket distribution strategy as per a well-crafted social engineering plan. This time, the SP gave most tickets to non-Yadav OBCs and Dalits, resulting in the party's best ever performance in a Lok Sabha election. Till now, the SP's best performance was in 2004, when it won 35 seats. Akhilesh Yadav gave tickets to only five Yadavs and four Muslims. Last time, it had fielded 10 Yadavs. This time, the party fielded 27 candidates belonging to non-Yadav OBCs. The 'PDA' strategy paid good dividends to the party as it gained 25 seats in OBC-reserved constituencies. It also gained six seats in Muslim-dominated constituencies. Akhilesh Yadav's party, which shed the tag of being a MY (Muslim+Yadav) party, virtually swept the seats in the Purvanchal region, where non-Yadav OBCs and Dalits form a major chunk of the electorate. The SP's decision to field Dalits from Meerut and Faizabad (Ayodhya) too worked wonders for the party. What took all by surprise was the BJP candidate Lallu Singh's loss to Samajwadi Party's Awadhesh Prasad in Faizabad, which houses the newly inaugurated Ram temple. The Congress too won four seats in seats dominated by OBCs. On the other hand, the BJP, which gave maximum tickets to upper castes, lost 23 seats in constituencies dominated by OBCs. It also suffered losses in Brahmin-dominated and Muslim-dominated seats."

Since 1997, the Biju Janta Dal has reigned over Odisha for 27 years. However, in the recently held state assembly polls, it lost to the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), breaking Patnaik's aura of invincibility in the state. The BJP bagged 78 seats in the 147-seat state assembly, while the BJD trailed behind as it was only able to get 51 seats, followed by Congress's 14 seats. In the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP also performed well, as it was able to secure 20 out of 21 general assembly seats in the state. Patnaik had made his entry into state politics by winning the 1998 Lok Sabha by-poll from the Aska constituency. But, after BJD secured a victory in the 2000 assembly elections and formed a government in alliance with the BJP, Patnaik resigned from his post in the Union Cabinet to assume the role of the state's Chief Minister. Since then, he has been the second longest-serving CM after Sikkim's Pawan Kumar Chamling."

Similarly, in the Soren vs Soren battle in Dumka too, the BJP lost to Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. Sita Soren, the eldest daughter-in-law of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha supremo Shibu Soren who recently parted ways with the party and joined the BJP, lost to JMM's Nalin Soren by a margin of 30,000 votes in the Dumka ST seat. Vijay Hansda, the sitting MP from Rajmahal, retained his seat after winning by a margin of 1,78,264 votes. Political experts had predicted that the sympathy wave following the arrest of former Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren could dent the opposition in Jharkhand. Hemant Soren was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in an alleged land scam on January 31. The INDIA bloc leaders had brought up Hemant Soren's arrest during their campaigns and tried to evoke the sentiments of the tribals. Another reason why the tribals ditched the BJP is their long-term demand from the Centre for allotment of the Sarna code, which is yet to be fulfilled. The Sarna Code proposes a separate religious code for tribal communities in India. The BJP won 12 out of 14 seats in the state in 2019. BJP spokesperson Pradip Sinha said that the party would introspect why it failed to win in the ST seats."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on Tuesday boarded the same flight to Delhi to attend their respective coalition meetings as political developments heightened following the BJP's failure to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha polls. Tejashwi Yadav and Nitish Kumar boarded the Patna-Delhi Vistara flight UK-718 and were both seen sitting together. However, they did not discuss anything related to politics and asked about each other's well-being, sources said. After that, Tejashwi Yadav returned to his seat and sat behind Nitish Kumar. Nitish Kumar and Tejashwi Yadav were on their way to Delhi to attend the NDA and INDIA bloc meetings to discuss the next course of action after the results of the Lok Sabha polls were declared. The BJP-led NDA won 292 of 543 seats, a far cry from their aim to win 400 seats. The BJP alone won 240 seats, the first time that the saffron party fell short of a majority (272) after coming to power in 2014. The Opposition INDIA bloc, defying predictions, put up a strong show and won 234 seats. The alliance is attempting to warm up to JD(U) and N Chandrababu Naidu's TDP to cobble up numbers in a bid to deny the BJP to form the government again. Both Naidu and Nitish Kumar will be in Delhi for the NDA meeting and the latter is likely to put forth his demand for the Speaker's post, sources told India Today TV. Naidu, whose TDP romped to an impressive victory in Andhra Pradesh in the assembly polls, reaffirmed his decision to \"firmly stay\" with the NDA, TDP sources said. They added that no one from the Opposition INDIA bloc has spoken to Naidu yet, though some feelers may have been sent to the TDP chief."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story As the INDIA bloc scripted a surprise turnaround in Uttar Pradesh in the Lok Sabha elections, several women in Lucknow queued up outside a Congress office demanding 'guarantee cards' that the party promised during campaigning. In the lead up to the polls, the Congress had distributed 'guarantee cards' to several households promising Rs 1 lakh every year to the woman head of every poor family. Visuals showed a large number of Muslim women lining up outside a Congress office in Lucknow in the sweltering heat. While some women demanded 'guarantee cards', those who received them previously submitted forms to receive the money in their accounts. Some women claimed they had received receipts from the Congress office after submitting their forms with details to receive the money. The Congress had launched the 'Ghar Ghar Guarantee' programme under which leaders were tasked to reach out to nearly 80 million households and make them aware of its 25 guarantees. Among these guarantees was the Mahalakshmi scheme under which the party promised that Rs 8,500 per month would be directly credited into the account of women heads of families belonging to the Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. The scheme is similar to the Gruha Lakshmi guarantee scheme of the Congress-led Karnataka government in which Rs 2,000 is paid to women heads of poor families. Recently, the General Post Office in Bengaluru saw several women rushing to open accounts anticipating a monthly deposit of Rs 8,500 into their accounts if the INDIA bloc came to power at the Centre. While the INDIA bloc, defying exit polls, bagged 234 seats, the NDA looks set to form the next government . The BJP-led NDA won 292 seats, managing to scrape past the majority mark of 272."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story India scripted history on June 4, and yet made a point. The country voted the BJP-led NDA back to power and gave Prime Minister Narendra Modi a third straight term , a feat that hadn't been achieved after Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. However, in the reduced mandate lay the message. And that was unmissable. The vote was a rap on the knuckles, not a total rejection. India had withdrawn the mandate for a single party to wield unbridled power. It isn't that Indians, in the recent past, shied away from giving power to a single party. It did so in 2014, and renewed the trust in 2019. However, they have now voted against single-party rule at the Centre. The fractured mandate shouldn't come as a surprise. It isn't normal for a big and diverse country like India to be ruled by one single party. For 32 years of India's 71-year electoral journey, the country saw coalition politics . Though it might sound like a great idea that a party gets the majority, because that gives it the power to make big-bang reforms and take decisive steps, it isn't natural for a country like India. Much smaller countries in Europe are run by coalition governments. The results of the 2024 Lok Sabha election pouring out was nothing short of a thriller that played out all day long. June 4 was very unlike the 2014 and 2019 results days. The heat of the election days had carried forward to the judgement day. The BJP was reduced to 239 seats from the 303 it won in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. The NDA to 291 from 353. This brings back the coalition era in Indian politics . The BJP will have to rely on its NDA partners and stick to coalition dharma for a stable government. The Opposition INDIA bloc won 234 seats, a surge missed by all the exit polls. The Congress, the biggest constituent of the INDIA grouping, nearly doubled its tally from 52 to 99 seats. It now qualifies for the leader of the opposition tag, which it lost in the 2014 drubbing. India has ensured that we have a strong Opposition to question the government. Numbers that can't be ignored by a brute majoritarian government. The parliamentary committees will now be more inclusive and democratic. They will have more Opposition members, who will have more say. Opposition voices in the Lok Sabha won't get drowned in chants. The message from India also revealed that the democratic institutions and the social fabric of the country is intact. Something the Opposition alleged the Modi-led BJP of having destroyed. Ironically, it was in the Opposition's surge that the narrative was exposed. That PM Modi-led NDA came to power for the third straight term is no mean feat in itself. India has had the habit of voting out incumbents, something the Congress managed to stave off in 2009 and the BJP in 2019. A third term for a Prime Minister is historic, given an anti-incumbency of 10 years. This mandate for the NDA, no doubt, is a stamp of approval for PM Modi. The BJP went into the Lok Sabha election without a central theme. PM Modi made the election all about himself. He braved all the attacks, and tried to deflect them towards the Opposition. In rally after rally, he said something that made it to the headlines. What is also important to note in the reduced mandate is the deeper penetration into territories that weren't dominated by the BJP. It made an almost clean sweep in Odisha, bagging 19 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats. In Kerala, the BJP landed its maiden victory, winning the Thrissur Lok Sabha seat. The BJP also scripted history by ending the Naveen Patnaik-led BJD's vice-like grip on Odisha. Such was the Modi wave that the BJP not only dislodged the 25-year-old BJD government but even defeated Naveen Babu on one of his two seats. However, the message from three big states, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, is clear. The NDA, which won 64 of the 80 seats in 2019, has been reduced to 36, even losing Faizabad, the constituency where the Ayodhya Ram Mandir is located. In Maharashtra, people rejected the split-and-rule politics by bringing the NDA numbers from 41 to 17. In Rajasthan, where the NDA made a clean sweep, winning all the 25 seats in 2019, voter anger over lack of water and bad roads pulled it down to 14 in the 2024 Lok Sabha election. After the results had played out the entire day, PM Modi late in the evening addressed BJP workers. He started his victory speech with chants of \"Jai Jagannath\" , a direct reference to the Odisha tryst and the victory that the BJP had tasted in the elections. There was no mention, however, of the reduced mandate for the party on a day branded historic by BJP President JP Nadda. Earlier on Tuesday (June 4), Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched a direct attack on PM Modi, saying that the country had \"made it clear to Narendra Modi, 'We don't want you'\". In the end, it's all about the message that India has sent out. A vote for the BJP as the biggest party but denying it a majority in the Lok Sabha is not an outright rejection, but a rap on its knuckles. When it began, it was said this wasn't a wave election. It turned out to be exactly that. In the end, it didn't give absolute joy to anyone. The BJP wasn't happy that it fell short of the majority mark. The INDIA bloc is unhappy that it doesn't get to form a government at the Centre. It was an election election. It was a victory of democracy and India sent out a message, loud and clear. The real power rests with the people - janata is janardan ."

The post by Congress on X showed Kishori Lal Sharma, who defeated BJP's Smriti Irani in Amethi , holding his winning certificate with Sonia Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi. While Rahul Gandhi won his maiden election from Raebareli after Sonia Gandhi moved to the Rajya Sabha, he also secured victory in Kerala's Wayanad by more than 3.64 lakh votes. In Raebareli, Rahul Gandhi bettered Sonia Gandhi's 2019 victory margin, winning by more than 3.90 lakh votes. However, Kishori Lal Sharma upset the BJP's applecart in Amethi, which was won by Smriti Irani in 2019 after defeating Rahul Gandhi. KL Sharma, a Gandhi family loyalist, won the seat in his electoral debut by a margin of over 1.67 lakh votes, emerging as a giant slayer. On Tuesday, addressing a press conference, Rahul Gandhi said the party loyalist had been working in the constituency for the past 40 years and his victory was certain. He also attacked the BJP for referring to Sharma as his \"personal assistant\". \"Don’t use terms like PA and steno for Kishori Lal Sharma. He has worked for 40 years in Amethi. The BJP doesn't respect people. The BJP didn't understand how closely connected KL Sharma is with the people of Amethi,\" Gandhi said."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis offered to resign as Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister, taking responsibility for the party's disastrous showing in the Lok Sabha elections. The former Chief Minister requested the BJP leadership to relieve him of his duties so that he could focus on strengthening the party ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly polls scheduled later this year. Addressing a media briefing, Fadnavis said, \"I take responsibility for such results in Maharashtra. I was leading the party. I am requesting the BJP high command to relieve me from the responsibility of the government so that I can work hard for the party in the upcoming elections.\" Fadnavis said the BJP leadership should give him time to focus on the party ahead of the Assembly polls later in November. Reacting to his deputy's statement, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde said, \"Electoral defeat is a collective responsibility. All three parties worked together in the elections. If you look at the vote share, Mahayuti got more than two lakh votes in Mumbai. The reasons for the defeat will be honestly reviewed. In the last two years, the government has taken many good decisions in the state. I will be speaking to Devendra ji soon. We have worked together in the past, and we will keep on working in the future. We have collectively failed to counter the false claims of the Opposition.\" Earlier in the day, the BJP unit in Maharashtra held a meeting to analyse the party's poor performance. The meeting was attended by Devendra Fadnavis and the BJP's state unit chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule and other senior leaders. The BJP-led NDA fell significantly short of its target of bagging 45 seats in Maharashtra. The BJP managed to win just nine Lok Sabha seats in the state. The party's tally dwindled by 14 as compared to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Together with its allies, the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar-led NCP, the NDA won 17 seats of the 48 seats. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP won 23 seats in Maharashtra. On the other hand, the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) punched above its weight to bag 30 seats. While the Congress won 13 seats, a massive jump from the solitary seat it won in the state in 2019, the Shiv Sena (UBT) won nine and NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) got eight seats."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Congress almost doubled its tally in the 2024 Lok Sabha election to 99 seats from 52 in 2019. It fell short of the 100-MP mark and its INDIA bloc fell short of dislodging the Modi government. However, the Congress might have something to cheer about. Voters have enabled the Congress to reclaim the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha post for itself. Interestingly, although the post of the Leader of the Opposition is coming back to the Congress's kitty, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the leader of the Congress in the outgoing Lok Sabha, has lost his seat. It is the leader of the principal opposition party in the Lok Sabha who acts as the LoP. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury was defeated by the former cricketer Yusuf Pathan of the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal's Baharampur, a seat which the Congress leader held since 1999. The Grand Old Party won just 44 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, and 52 in 2019. In the outgoing batch of the Lok Sabha, although the Congress, with 52 seats, was the second-biggest party in the house after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the party fell short of the criteria which would place it as the principal opposition party in the house. The Congress, with less than 10% of the seats in the lower house, lost the key functionary, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. In the absence of the status in the 17th Lok Sabha, Congress's Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury was named the leader of the Congress Party in the Lok Sabha. The 2024 mandate, thus, would translate into the Congress rightfully claiming back the position it lost in 2014, and the benefits associated with it. That post of Leader of the Opposition has been vacant since 2014, as no opposition party could amass 10% seats. After the 2014 Lok Sabha debacle of Congress, the ruling BJP government, through the appointed Speaker, decided not to recognise the party’s leader as Leader of Opposition, which was a matter of major embarrassment for the party. The Modi government adhered to the Mavalankar rule to deny the Congress leader the status of Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha. GV Mavalankar, the first Lok Sabha Speaker, established the 10% rule, which states that for the main Opposition party to be officially recognised in the Lok Sabha, its strength must be equal to the quorum of the house. The quorum is equivalent to 10% of the members in the House. A quorum is the minimum number of members required to be present at a meeting to conduct official business and make decisions in a house. Later, the Leader of Opposition became a statutory post officially introduced by the Janata government in 1977 through an Act of Parliament, according to PJ Antony, former Principal Secretary of Nagaland legislative Assembly, and a former Director of Lok Sabha. \"Though the Act provides for the leader of the single-largest party to be recognised as the Leader of Opposition by the Speaker, of late, a requirement of not less than 10% of the seats in Parliament is attached as a precondition for such recognition. The Act does not specifically provide for this condition and the Speaker is at liberty to recognise the largest opposition party's leader as Leader of Opposition. The ruling party is expected to respect the original statutory position, regardless of the dilution practised,\" Antony tells IndiaToday.In. \"The ruling party in 2014 and 2019 refused to give the post to the main opposition party, despite there being no bar on recognising the leader of the largest opposition party as the Leader of Opposition,\" adds Antony. What the Congress in 2019, shy of just three seats, lost was not just the post of the Leader of Opposition, it also lost the privileges linked to it. The Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha is also a member of crucial committees, including Public Accounts, Public Undertakings, Estimates, and several Joint Parliamentary Committees, to name a few. The Leader of the Opposition is also a member of various selection committees responsible for appointing heads of statutory bodies like the Central Vigilance Commission, the Central Information Commission, the CBI Director, the NHRC Chairperson, the Lokpal, which the Congress had stayed away from in the last 10 years. Along with the embarrassment, the narrative of 'no opposition being left in the country' had been hitting the Congress, the party that crossed the 400-mark in the Lok Sabha in 1984. With the Congress claiming back a bigger chunk of the opposition space in 2024, it would also have an official leader in the Lok Sabha."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The discontent against the BJP among the Kshatriya community is likely to have prevented the party from getting a majority on its own. The BJP emerged as the single-largest party, winning 240 seats, but is dependent on its allies to cross the majority mark of 272. The pot of dissent has been simmering for a long time, triggered by the controversial statement of BJP leader Parsottam Rupala and fuelled by allegations of Kshatriya history distortion, especially on the Mihir Bhoj row, and the Agniveer scheme, among other crucial issues. The community held many mahapanchayats across the country in the lead up to the Lok Sabha polls. While Rupala won his seat successfully, the party lost the Banaskantha seat to Congress candidate Ganiben Thakore. Thakore became the first Rajput candidate to win in Gujarat. The BJP did not field any Kshatriya candidates this time. Similarly, the BJP lost seven seats in Rajasthan, where similar agitations took place. \"Not taking the history distortion protest seriously, biased approach towards giving tickets, ignoring the Econically Weaker Section relaxation and giving tickets to leaders like Shubhkaran Chaudhary, who is known for his anti-Rajput statements are some of the reasons behind why the Rajputs distanced themselves from the BJP,\" Lokendra Singh Kilanaut, former student leader of Rajasthan University, said. He also said the BJP gave tickets to other dominant OBC candidates who lost previous elections instead of Rajput candidates, fuelling the dissent. \"Since the formation of the new government in the state, one particular community is being placed at key posts, which has also led to the Kshatriya community staying away from the BJP,\" Kilanaut said. One of the biggest setbacks the BJP faced was in Uttar Pradesh, where the NDA's seats declined from 64 in 2019 to just 36 in this elections. In Uttar Pradesh, a cocktail of Rupala's statement that erstwhile 'maharajas' broke bread with the British and also married off their daughters to them, allegations of Kshatriya history distortion, the Agniveer scheme were among the key issues that led to resentment in the community. In 2014, the BJP had given 21 tickets to Kshatriya candidates, out of which 19 had won. In the 2024 polls, BJP gave tickets to merely 10 candidates from the community. Thakur Puran Singh of Kisan Majdoor Sangathan, who held rallies against the BJP, said, \"The BJP may think that giving tickets to people like Mahesh Sharma from Noida and Atul Garg from Ghaziabad will have no effect as the urban voters will make them win the elections. But these two are Kshatriya dominant seats and the biased actions of Sharma during the Mihir Bhoj controversy had a long-lasting effect on the community, and they have largely voted against the party in almost all these seats.\" \"The party remained silent or even facilitated distortion of Kshatriya history by attributing Samrat Mihir Bhoj as Gujjar, Samrat Prithvi Raj Chauhan as Gujjar, Samrat Anangpal Tomar as Jat or sometimes Gujjar, Raja Porus (Puru) as Jat and sometimes Ahir, Rana Punja Solanki as Bhil, Shuldev Bais as Rajbhar, Alha And Udal, the Banaphar Rajput commanders, as Ahirs and many more. What do they expect from the community? To remain their slave?\" he said. Despite efforts from Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the community seem to have chosen not to vote for the BJP. The defeat of Sanjeev Balyan from Muzaffarnagar is being seen as one of the results of a failed attempt to pacify the community. Aditya Rana, a resident of Bisahada village of Satha Chaurasi area, known as the \"army factory\" of North India, said, \"Balyan had been accused of being a casteist, and he was also shooed away from Thakur Chaubisi (24 villages of Kshatriya community) and his cavalcade was also attacked. His defeat was imminent as, despite repeated complaints, the party had given him a ticket. Muzaffarnagar is not Noida where urban voters can change the dynamics, the party should have listened to the community.\" The Agniveer scheme and silence on EWS quota relaxation also fuelled the discontent among the community. Major (Retd) Himanshu Som, an activist, who also teaches youth in the community, said, \"Primarily, the Kshatriya youth in villages prepared for the army, but the Agniveer scheme has snatched their dream and the most preferred livelihood option. Those who are being selected don't have a secured future, so the number of aspirants also dropped.\" \"Also, with land clause unnecessarily added in EWS relaxation, the Rajput youth from the marginalised farming families are not getting a fair chance in central government jobs. Despite repeated requests, the government remained silent on both issues,\" he added. Ignoring the community in the Ram Mandir Trust also had an adverse effect on the party's vote share. The BJP lost to the Samajwadi Party in Faizabad, which houses the newly inaugurated Ram temple. \"How can the government give credit to other communities of the Ram Mandir movement and completely ignore the Kshatriyas who had fought more battles than anyone for the temple? No place for any community leader in the Ram Mandir Trust also led to the community losing trust in the party,\" said Rakesh Singh Raghuvanshi, president, Karni Sena, Uttar Pradesh."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Haryana and Uttar Pradesh witnessed a resurgence of opposition parties in this Lok Sabha election, but Delhi was a different story . While the neigbouring states delivered unfavourable results, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) achieved a hat-trick (2014, 2019, 2024) of clean sweeps in Delhi. The outcome proved many pollsters wrong at a time when the two rivals, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Congress , joined hands to stop the saffron juggernaut. Despite suffering heavy losses in the state elections of Delhi, the BJP's triumphant return in the national polls highlights a significant political dynamic for the capital city. The margins of victory in all seven seats have been notably reduced , pointing at a more competitive landscape. However, the BJP's victory is a substantial morale boost for its local unit. The capital's electorate preferred the national narrative set by the BJP. This divergence between state and national election outcomes suggests that Delhi's voters differentiate between local governance and broader national issues when casting their ballots. Here are the factors which made the rather difficult battle look so one-sided for the BJP: The BJP made a strategic decision to introduce fresh faces by replacing most incumbents with new but experienced candidates in this election. This injected new energy and perspective into the party. The new faces were no novices, having their skills honed at the municipal level. Three of them had served as mayors of former municipal corporations. Kamaljeet Sehrawat, the BJP MP for West Delhi, was the ex-mayor of the erstwhile South Delhi Municipal Corporation. Similarly, Harsh Malhotra, now representing East Delhi, led the East Delhi Municipal Corporation. Yogendra Chandolia, now the face for North West Delhi, was at the helm of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. The BJP’s choice underscores their faith in leaders with grassroots governance experience, believing it will translate into effective national leadership. Beyond former mayors, other candidates also bring a wealth of experience in various fields. For instance, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, the South Delhi candidate, is currently the Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly. Chandni Chowk’s new Member of Parliament, Praveen Khandelwal, is a renowned trade leader. He helms the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), an influential body that gained prominence during the 2005-06 sealing and demolition crisis in Delhi, where Khandelwal emerged as a staunch advocate for traders and residents alike. While the AAP and Congress struggled to finalise a seat-sharing arrangement , the BJP announced candidates on all the seven seats nearly 70 days ahead of polling. With Delhi slated to go to the polls on May 25, this early move provided the BJP a substantial head start in election preparation and public outreach. The BJP's candidates meticulously strategised their public engagements, utilising the extended preparation period to connect on a micro-level with both party workers and the electorate. The planning was precise, incorporating small corner meetings alongside morning and evening ' Padyatras' (foot marches), allowing candidates ample time to familiarise themselves with the masses and establish a strong presence. Each of the seven parliamentary constituencies in Delhi comprises ten assembly segments. The considerable lead enabled the BJP candidates to navigate these areas systematically, avoiding the last-minute rush. The BJP has been proactive in its electoral strategy against the AAP-Congress alliance - which it views as a formidable threat capable of eroding its presence in Delhi. To damage the image of the alliance, the BJP targeted the partnership, painting it as an arrangement born of desperation and political expediency. With this move, the BJP wanted to position itself as the sole party genuinely concerned with governance and public service in the national capital. The inner turmoil within the Congress party further bolstered the BJP’s position. The internal strife became particularly evident during the ticket distribution phase, leading to significant dissent within Congress ranks. This discord culminated in the resignation of Delhi Congress president Arvinder Singh Lovely, who openly criticised the alliance as contrary to the interests of party workers. His departure was soon followed by other senior leaders, including Rajkumar Chauhan, Naseeb Singh, and Neeraj Basoya, who collectively defected to the BJP. This wave of resignations and subsequent joining of BJP by prominent figures has provided a significant morale boost to the saffron party. It hasn't merely strengthened BJP numerically but has also reinforced its narrative that all is not well within the INDIA bloc in Delhi. The BJP was aware of Kejriwal's considerable influence among Delhi voters and viewed him as a formidable threat, particularly if he decided to campaign with full vigour. Kejriwal’s popularity is largely anchored in his public welfare schemes, which have consistently resonated with the masses. However, as the elections drew near, Kejriwal found himself embroiled in controversies. He was sent to jail on corruption charges related to Delhi's excise policy. This development was widely perceived as a political vendetta orchestrated by the BJP-led central government to weaken the opposition. Consequently, Kejriwal gained significant sympathy, amplified by the Supreme Court granting him interim bail just a fortnight before the crucial elections. This scenario posed a precarious challenge for the BJP, as they struggled to counter the strong narrative of political victimisation. The BJP’s efforts to nullify the sympathy wave towards Kejriwal seemed increasingly futile. However, a fortuitous turn of events provided the BJP with an unexpected lifeline. Internal discord within AAP surfaced when Swati Maliwal, a Rajya Sabha MP, alleged physical assault by Kejriwal's PA at the Chief Minister's residence. This incident was deftly exploited by the BJP to tarnish Kejriwal’s image further, portraying him not just as corrupt but also as anti-women. The AAP party struggled to manage the fallout, and even its ally, Congress was unable to effectively counter the BJP's narrative. The initial advantage Kejriwal gained after his release from jail quickly evaporated. In a cosmopolitan city like Delhi, many would assume that caste and gender considerations take a backseat. But that's far from the truth. The results on Tuesday threw light on the BJP's strategic ticket distribution in line with the caste and gender representation. The BJP allocated two out of seven tickets to women, directly countering Arvind Kejriwal's pro-women schemes. This approach was essential as gender representation can swing votes. Moreover, BJP's attention to caste dynamics was evident in their candidate selection. For instance, Manoj Tiwari, now a third-time MP from Northeast Delhi, represented the Purvanchali and Brahmin communities. Harsh Malhotra and Bansuri Swaraj, both Punjabis, also carried significant weight due to their Haryana connections. Meanwhile, Kamaljeet Sehrawat, another female MP from West Delhi belonged to the influential Jat community. In Chandni Chowk, Praveen Khandelwal, a Vaishya, emerged victorious, while Ramveer Singh Bidhuri from South Delhi came from the Gurjar community, and Yogendra Chandolia, a Dalit by caste, won in the reserved Northwest constituency. In stark contrast, the AAP-Congress alliance faltered on these. They failed to field any candidate from the significant Punjabi and Jat communities, which hold considerable sway in both urban and rural Delhi. More strikingly, the INDIA bloc did not present even a single female candidate to counter BJP's two women representatives. This was further compounded when AAP fielded a Dalit candidate, Kuldip Kumar, in a non-reserved East Delhi constituency. The alliance also excluded Brahmin candidates, whereas the BJP had two Brahmins."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story BJP leader Narendra Modi is likely to be sworn in as the Prime Minister for a third term on June 8, according to sources. Just notice the number eight. This isn't the first time that eight has appeared in PM Modi's big events. But what is the significance of eight in numerology? The number 8, in numerology, denotes the planet Saturn, and 8 is also a symbol of justice, Noida-based numerologist Rahul Singh tells IndiaToday.In \"Number eight is also a symbol of Rajyog (a type of auspicious yog in Vedic astrology relating to royal-like benefits). Generally, those who have Saturn (Shani) in exaltation experience delayed success in life. But the success is of a very-high level. All enemies are defeated,\" explains Rahul Singh. That eight is of significance can be seen from the fact that demonetisation, one of the biggest decisions of Modi 1.0, was declared on November 8 at 8 pm. He even launched the Digital India drive on September 26, 2015. The numbers 2 and 6 added up to 8 and the same is true for 2 + 0 + 1 + 5. PM Modi was born on September 17. The numbers 1 and 7 add up to 8. Though it is true in Modi's case, numerologist Singh says it is not necessary that only those born on the eighth day of the month are influenced by this number. \"Any number can be lucky for anyone, regardless of their birthdate. It is not restricted to those born on the eighth,\" he explains. The number eight is also significant for India, astrologer Shailendra Pandey tells India Today TV. \"India's Republic Day is on January 26, which also sums up to the number eight. This marks the day when India became a Republic with the implementation of the Constitution. This, too, is influenced by the number eight,\" adds Pandey. There's also a strange coincidence with 2024: the numbers of the year (2+0+2+4) add up to 8. The swearing-in ceremony on June 8, therefore, can't be just a coincidence and must have been arrived at after some thought. \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is influenced by the number eight and taking the oath on June 8, must have understood the influence of this number. I believe that the impact of the number eight will be seen in his work as Prime Minister,\" numerologist Rahul Singh tells IndiaToday.In. Singh also deciphers the personality of people influenced by 8. He says those who are positively influenced by the number eight are very hardworking and that's evident from their efforts and energy. Although the date is likely to be June 8, astrologer Shailendra Pandey says, it's important to not just focus on the date but also on the time and the auspicious moment (muhurat) during which oath will be taken. \"The time of the oath will play a crucial role. The horoscope made for the moment of the oath will reveal how the next five years will be for the government and what kind of challenges or opportunities they might face. So, you cannot make a decision based solely on the number,\" says astrologer Pandey. \"But when it comes to elections and oath-taking, other planets must also be considered,\" added astrologer Pandey. However, honesty should be the mantra while harnessing the power of eight, else it could lead to consequences, suggests Rahul Singh. \"Since the number eight is a symbol of justice, people under its influence need to be morally strong in their work. If they act immorally, Saturn delivers consequences, often negative ones, affecting their health. It has been observed that Saturn can punish in such cases, and no one can escape it. That is the nature of the number eight,\" says the numerologist."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The BJP saw a dismal show in Punjab and Haryana in the Lok Sabha election results declared on Tuesday. While the party failed to win any seats in Punjab, it lost five seats in neighbouring Haryana, where it had won all 10 seats last time. Interestingly, the saffron party nearly doubled its vote share in Punjab but could not retain the two seats it had won in 2019. The party lost half of its seats and 12 per cent of its vote share to the Congress in Haryana. Here are the five reasons why the lotus could not bloom in Punjab and wilted in Haryana: The majority of voters in Punjab and Haryana live in rural areas. At least 65.12 per cent of Haryana and 62.52 per cent of Punjab's population live in rural areas. The urban population of Haryana and Punjab is 34.88 per cent and 37.52 per cent, respectively. The BJP's traditional vote bank lies in urban and semi-urban pockets. Whether in Haryana or Punjab, the party lacked a rural base. The year 2014 was an exception when the party formed a government in Haryana on its own. It could not secure enough rural or Jat votes in 2019 and was compelled to form an alliance with the JJP, which bagged 14.80 per cent of the votes, mostly from the Jat community. In both Haryana and Punjab, the urban-rural divide is one of the primary reasons why the lotus could not bloom this time. Until 2020, when the BJP-Shiromani Akali Dal alliance existed, the BJP only contested in 23 Assembly seats and three Lok Sabha segments. Elections in rural constituencies were contested by the Akali Dal. It is the first time the BJP tried its luck in rural Punjab. The party lacked a strong alliance partner with a rural base in both Punjab and Haryana. Until 2020, the urban-rural divide was not as wide as it became after the three controversial farm laws were introduced. The farmers' protests further widened the gap between rural and urban voters. The first farmers' agitation, which started in late 2020, received support from almost all quarters, including the urban population. The second farmers' agitation, which started in the lead-up to the 2024 elections, got a tepid response from urban Haryana and Punjab as it affected the movement of people and resulted in losses for business owners. The farmer unions did not allow BJP leaders to enter villages, which badly hit the party's election campaign. The farmer unions painted the BJP's image in rural areas as 'anti-farmer.' Despite offering MSP on more than a dozen crops in Haryana and purchasing every grain on MSP in Punjab, the BJP could not attract rural voters. Despite having ruled Haryana for a decade, the BJP could not attract the Jat community, which forms 22 per cent of the electorate. The voters of this community remained loyal to the Congress, the INLD, and the JJP. The Congress, which increased its vote share by 15 per cent in the 2024 LS elections, was successful in consolidating the Jat votes. In 2019, the BJP was able to attract voters from all communities except the Jats. The party's vote share was 58 per cent in 2019 after it clean-swept all 10 seats in Haryana. This time, the BJP's vote share dipped to 46 per cent, showing that its social engineering to attract the non-Jat and OBCs did not work. The party replaced Manohar Lal Khattar just before the Lok Sabha polls and announced Nayab Singh Saini as Chief Minister to attract the OBC community, but it did not eliminate anti-incumbency. The Brahmins and sarpanch associations were also miffed with the BJP. According to the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) data, Haryana has the third-highest rate of unemployment in the country. Haryana's unemployment rate among those above 15 years of age was 6.1 per cent. The neighbouring Punjab has the same unemployment percentage, with people alleging that jobs were being given to non-Punjabis. There are allegations against the Haryana government that work was also not available under MGNREGA, the national rural employment scheme. The state government's scheme to reserve 75 per cent of vacancies in the industrial areas for locals also backfired. A government recruitment centre opened in Rohtak for employment as construction workers in Israel also sparked controversy. The state government failed to fill nearly two lakh vacancies following the multiple cancellations of recruitment tests due to unfair practices. There was also dissent among the youth over the Agniveer scheme, which the Congress managed to capitalise on. The Congress promised to end the Agniveer recruitment scheme if voted to power. In both Punjab and Haryana, the poor show of voters in urban areas resulted in a reduced vote share. Haryana recorded a 64.80 per cent voter turnout in 2024, down from 70 per cent in 2019. More votes were cast in rural areas than in urban areas. The long weekend and rising temperatures kept voters indoors. In the Gurugram constituency, there was a 62.03 per cent voter turnout, down from 67.33 per cent in 2019. The voter turnout in neighbouring Punjab was 62.80 per cent. None of the assembly segments in the nine Lok Sabha seats of Patiala, Sangrur, Faridkot, Fatehgarh Sahib, Anandpur Sahib, Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, and Amritsar touched the 70 per cent turnout mark. Heavy polling was reported in rural areas, including Khadoor Sahib. The turnout in urban areas affected the BJP, which has its traditional vote bank in urban and semi-urban areas. Interestingly, the construction of the Ram temple or issues like national security did not garner many votes for the BJP in Punjab and Haryana."

While many of them won the polls to return to Parliament, seven ministers contesting from Uttar Pradesh faced defeat while other ministers contesting from the state saw their winning margin reduced. Let’s have a look at these seven ministers and what they said about their defeat. In a big upset for the BJP, Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani lost from Amethi to Gandhi family loyalist Kishori Lal Sharma by 1,67,196 votes. Kishori Lal Sharma’s announcement as Congress candidate from Amethi was touted as a walk-over for Smriti Irani from Amethi, who emerged into the political arena as a giant slayer by defeating Rahul Gandhi from the same seat in 2019. Five years later, Kishori Lal Sharma emerged as the biggest giant slayer in this election. Such is life...

    "article_content": "Listen to Story \"Those who could not see you, see you now, but some of us have always seen and known you to be the bravest of all,\" Priyanka Gandhi Vadra wrote in a heartfelt tweet to her brother Rahul Gandhi as the Congress, defying exit poll predictions, gave the BJP a run for its money along with its allies. In fact, it was the spirited and well-coordinated campaigning strategy by the Gandhi siblings that saw the Congress script a stunning fightback, bettering its 2019 tally and winning 99 seats . If the 53-year-old Rahul Gandhi kept up his attack on the BJP throughout his Bharat Jodo Yatra (two editions), Priyanka Gandhi, the younger sibling, emerged as the Congress's 'campaigner-in-chief' , delivering the party's message to voters as well as tackling the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's jibes with sharp counters. A case in point was her impassioned response to PM Modi's claim that the Congress, if elected, would redistribute the country's wealth among Muslims, adding that the party \"won't even leave your mangalsutras \". Priyanka Gandhi hit back, saying that her mother Sonia Gandhi had sacrificed her \" mangalsutra \" for the country. \"When there was a war, my grandmother (former PM Indira Gandhi) donated her gold to the country. My mother's mangalsutra was sacrificed for this country,\" Priyanka Gandhi said, referring to the assassination of her father and former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Amethi (PTI) While Rahul Gandhi was more visible and focused on his campaigns, the 52-year-old Priyanka Gandhi worked quietly behind-the-scenes in the party's voter outreach campaign. While other leaders of the INDIA bloc went to the voters with their caste census appeal, Priyanka Gandhi asked the people to vote for bread-and-butter issues, keeping up the heat on the BJP over price rise and unemployment. On the other hand, Rahul Gandhi led an aggressive election campaign that was generously peppered with impromptu interactions with different sections of society to gauge their mood. In fact, unlike in 2014 and 2019, the ruling BJP failed to set the narrative that stuck with the people and the Congress manifesto and Rahul Gandhi's 'wealth redistribution' remark became the major talking point during PM Modi's campaigns. Rahul Gandhi also used PM Modi's '400 paar ' call to whip up a campaign alleging that the NDA was seeking such a huge mandate to change the Constitution. The template was followed by other opposition leaders like Akhilesh Yadav and Mamata Banerjee and saw the BJP drop its '400 paar ' slogan after the first two rounds of voting. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi with brother Rahul Gandhi arrives to cast her vote at a polling booth in Delhi (PTI) While Rahul Gandhi's ' Chowkidar chor hai ' slogan may have backfired in the 2019 polls, his \" khatakhat khatakhat \" remark on transferring money to bank accounts of poor women shaped the narrative of the election. The BJP and its allies suddenly found themselves playing catch-up. Apart from carrying out two padyatras from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Manipur to Mumbai, Rahul Gandhi added a humane touch to his campaign as videos of him interacting with coolies, students, truck drivers and mechanics struck a chord on social media. In all, Rahul Gandhi showed a side of his that the country had not seen before. As Rahul Gandhi criss-crossed the nation, Priyanka Gandhi nurtured and campaigned extensively in the Gandhi family bastions of Amethi and Raebareli. With Amethi voting out Rahul Gandhi and electing BJP's Smriti Irani in 2019 and Sonia Gandhi deciding not to contest from Raebareli, there was a large vacuum to be filled. However, Priyanka Gandhi performed her duties to perfection as she invoked her family's historic ties with the two constituencies to strike a chord in her rallies. The party general secretary also spoke about her childhood, how she accompanied her father Rajiv Gandhi during campaigning in Amethi. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra being greeted during an election rally in Rae Bareli (PTI) The numbers at the rallies kept swelling as she camped in Raebareli and Amethi for two weeks and went from village to village to connect with the voters. Altogether, she took part in 108 public meetings and roadshows. The result paid rich dividends. Amethi went back to Congress , with Gandhi family loyalist Kishori Lal Sharma beating Irani by more than 1.67 lakh votes. Raebareli too voted en masse for the Congress, with Rahul Gandhi bettering Sonia Gandhi's 2019 victory margin. The former Congress chief won by 3.90 lakh votes. A good orator and mass mobiliser, the elections also cemented her position as a key strategist of the Congress - a post that was vacant after the death of the party's key mediator-cum-trouble shooter, Ahmed Patel. It was visible when, during an interview with India Today, Priyanka Gandhi revealed why she did not contest the Lok Sabha election. The younger sibling said if both she and Rahul Gandhi contested the polls, it would be beneficial for the BJP. \"If both of us had contested, then we would have had to stay in our own constituency for 15 days. So, it would be appropriate that one should campaign throughout the entire country,\" she said."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The NDA secured 30 seats in the Lok Sabha elections in Bihar, which is the highest in the state, helping it cross the majority mark and form the government. The BJP and the JD(U) won 12 seats each, out of the 17 and 16 seats they contested, while the Lok Janshakti Party won all the five seats and the Hindustani Awam Morcha won one seat as part of the alliance. The JD(U)'s performance indicates that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar took the right decision by leaving the Mahagathbandhan alliance in the state and joining the NDA. According to sources, all 16 JD(U) MPs had urged Nitish to join the NDA at that time and flagged the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In 2019 polls, the JD(U) won 16 out of the 17 seats it contested. Meanwhile, the other parties that were part of the Mahagathbandhan performed poorly in the elections. Despite Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav's extensive campaigning, the RJD could only win four out of the 23 seats it contested, while the Congress won three out of the nine seats it contested. This suggests that if Nitish Kumar had stayed with the Mahagathbandhan , the JD(U) could have faced greater losses. The JD(U)'s success in the Lok Sabha polls seems to be due to PM Modi's popularity. Many voters expressed distrust in Nitish Kumar due to his frequent policy changes, but they voted for JD(U) to ensure Modi's return as Prime Minister. The NDA's seat share in the state dropped from 39 in 2019 to 30 in 2024 and the main reason behind this could be dissatisfaction with Nitish Kumar and not Tejashwi Yadav's popularity. Because, if that had been the case, then the RJD would not have been limited to just four seats."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Congress leader Jairam Ramesh has questioned Telugu Desam Party (TDP) supremo N Chandrababu Naidu whether he could demand special category status for the state to support NDA at the Centre. In a post on X, Jairam Ramesh said, \"Will you have the courage to demand special category status for Andhra Pradesh as a non-negotiable precondition for support to the NDA at the Centre?\" In another post, Ramesh also highlighted how, in 2018, the TDP left the NDA to protest the BJP’s \"inaction\" on this demand. \"Now it’s cravenly fallen back into the BJP’s embrace, despite the party staying silent on the matter,\" he said. In the Lok Sabha election results declared on Tuesday, the TDP emerged as BJP's biggest NDA ally on the national front, winning 16 Lok Sabha seats out of the total 25 in Andhra Pradesh. The TDP also emerged as the single-largest party in the state assembly election, winning 135 seats in the 175-member Legislative Assembly. While the TDP switching sides wouldn't assure the Congress-led INDIA bloc to catapult to the majority mark, either in Andhra Pradesh or in Centre, but could dent the BJP's chances of forming government at the Centre. Jairam Ramesh emphasised how only the Congress could deliver on the promise of special category status for Andhra Pradesh. \"The Congress Nyay Patra once again reiterates the promise of Special Category Status (SCS) for the state of Andhra Pradesh. This was a promise made during the passage of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, by none other than Dr. Manmohan Singh himself, who committed to it on the floor of the Rajya Sabha in February 2014,\" he said. \"As a state with Special Category Status, Andhra Pradesh would receive benefits such as special central assistance grants, better financing terms for externally aided projects, excise duty concessions, and tax breaks to help attract investment. After the loss of Hyderabad, these provisions could have helped lay the foundations for the state’s continued prosperity - but the Modi Sarkar betrayed the people of the state for 10 years,\" he added. A special category status is a classification offered by the Centre to the states that face socio-economic disadvantages and geographical difficulties. Both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were assured of special category status ahead of bifurcation in 2014. Telangana, after being carved out of united Andhra Pradesh, was accorded special category status, but Andhra Pradesh has been denied by the Centre. Notably, Naidu walked out of the NDA alliance in 2018 after the Modi government did not accord the status to the state. In July 2018, the TDP moved a no-confidence motion against the Centre, which the government won after a gruelling debate. On the flip side, the outgoing Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy had earlier made strong pitches for special category status to the state. However, he failed to convince the top brass of the BJP."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Bharatiya Janata Party's loss in Uttar Pradesh's Faizabad Lok Sabha seat, where the Ram Mandir is being built, is seen as a big setback for the Saffron Party, which rose due to the temple movement. However, the loss at Faizabad, the home to the magnificent temple, coincided with the defeat in Shravasti, a Lok Sabha seat 100 kilometres away. The BJP candidate from Shravasti was Saket Misra, the son of Nripendra Misra, the bureaucrat who is heading the trust that is getting the Ram Temple constructed in Ayodhya. Saket Misra is currently a member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council. One of the major poll planks for the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha election was the construction of the temple at the Ram Janmabhoomi site in Ayodhya. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the chief jajman of the pran pratishtha ceremony of the Ram Lalla idol in the temple on January 22. Political experts believed that the construction of the Ram Mandir would help the BJP reap electoral dividends. However, the defeat of Saket Misra comes as a double blow for the BJP, coinciding with its defeat in Faizabad. The BJP lost both the seats to the Samajwadi Party (SP). While the SP's Ram Shiromani Verma defeated the BJP's Saket Misra in Shravasti, its candidate, Awadhesh Prasad, trounced the BJP's Lallu Singh in Faizabad , just months after the Pran Prathishtha ceremony in Ayodhya. BJP's Lallu Singh had been the Faizabad MP since 2014. Shravasti is also important historically and culturally as it is the site of Mahatma Buddha's penance, as well as the karmabhoomi (workplace) of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Shravasti occupies an important place in Buddhism and is known for being the place where Gautam Buddha spent many monsoons and performed several miracles after he attained enlightenment in Bodh Gaya, according to Buddhist mythology. Shravasti also finds a mention in ancient Hindu texts like the Mahabharata, associated with the rule of King Sravasta. In Jainism too, Shravasti has been associated with several Tirthankaras, including Sambhavanatha, the third Tirthankara. When the former Prime Minister Atal Vihari Vajpayee reached the Parliament in 1957, he was elected from UP's Balrampur seat. It was the Shravasti Lok Sabha constituency which later inherited the areas that fell under the Balrampur seat, following the delimitation exercise of 2008. Ten years later, Vajpayee won the seat again in 1967."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Two candidates who are in jail on terror charges have been elected in the 2024 Lok Sabha election, the results of which were declared on June 4. While Amritpal Singh won the Lok Sabha election from Punjab's Khadoor Sahib, Sheikh Abdul Rashid was elected from Baramulla in Kashmir Valley. The election of the two candidates currently in jail has thrown up a unique question -- will they get to take the oath of office and will they be able to attend Parliament sessions? Legally, Amritpal Singh and Sheikh Abdul Rashid are barred from attending the proceedings of the 18th Lok Sabha, yet they retain the Constitutional right to be sworn in as members of Parliament, according to a PTI report. So, the single question we are left with to answer is -- will be able to take the oath of office as MPs? As per the results declared by the Election Commission on June 4, Sikh preacher Amritpal Singh, who is in jail, secured a win in the Khadoor Sahib constituency, while Sheikh Abdul Rashid, known as Engineer Rashid, also imprisoned, won in Baramulla in Kashmir. Engineer Rashid has been in Tihar jail since August 9, 2019 on the charges of allegedly financing terror. Singh has been charged under the National Security Act and is at the Dibrugarh jail in Assam. But the question remains, can they take an oath? What is the process for jailed parliamentarians to attend the oath ceremony after winning the Lok Sabha elections? Constitution expert and former Lok Sabha secretary general PDT Achari explained the legal aspects of the matter. He said being sworn in after winning elections is a constitutional right. But if the winning candidate is in jail, they must ask the authorities to be taken to Parliament for the oath-taking ceremony. Once they have taken the oath, they must return to the jail. He further explained the provisions as he cited Article 101 (4) of the Constitution which involves the absence of MPs from both houses without the knowledge of the Chair. After their oath ceremony, the Speaker would be informed about their absence from the house. The speaker will then inform them about their inability to attend the House to the House Committee on Absence of Members. The Committee recommends whether the MP should be allowed not to attend the House proceedings. This recommendation is then taken forward and put to a vote of the House by the Speaker. If Engineer Rashid or Singh get convicted and jailed for even two years, they will lose their seats in Lok Sabha, as per a Supreme Court judgement of 2013 which held that such MPs and MLAs would be disqualified. The judgement The Committee then recommends whether the member should be allowed to remain absent from House proceedings or not. The recommendation is then put to the vote of the House by the Speaker. If Engineer Rashid or Singh were to be convicted and jailed for a minimum of two years, they would lose their seats in the Lok Sabha immediately, as per the Supreme Court judgement of 2013 which holds that MPs and MLAs would be disqualified in such cases. The judgement took down Section 8(4) of the Representation of the People Act, which permitted convicted MPs and MLAs a three-month time span to appeal against their indictment."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) created history in Odisha by sweeping both the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections that were held simultaneously. This is also the first time that the saffron party will be forming the government on its own in the eastern state, ending the decades-old rule of Naveen Patnaik's Biju Janata Dal (BJD). On Tuesday (June 4), the day the election results were announced, Prime Minister Narendra Modi started his victory speech at the BJP headquarters in Delhi with the chant of “Jai Jagannath”, hailing the people of Odisha. This was quite a break from the PM's usual slogan of \"Jai Shri Ram\", which has been a signature call of the party. However, the slogan acquired a new tempo with the consecration ceremony of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya early this year. Despite the high-pitched war cry, the BJP performed miserably in the temple towns of Uttar Pradesh. PM Modi, hours after the Lok Sabha results were announced on Tuesday, told a cheering crowd of BJP leaders and workers: \"For the first time, there will be a BJP chief minister in Mahaprabhu Jagannath’s land.\" \"I am an Oriya and when the PM said ‘Jai Jagannath’, I felt really, really proud. The prime minister has made it very clear that the development of Odisha will be among his top priorities,\" said Aparajita Sarangi, the BJP Member of Parliament from Bhubaneswar. For the BJP, the Lok Sabha election results have been a mixed bag. In a few states, the saffron party has performed quite well, while in the crucial states of Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, the BJP suffered a massive drubbing. Odisha is one state where the BJP has bagged 20 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats. The party also won 78 of the 147 Assembly seats and is all set to form the next state government. In Orissa, the BJP had set the target of winning 17 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats and 75 of the 147 Assembly seats. After suffering a massive defeat at the hands of the BJP, the 24-year-long tenure of Naveen Patnaik, the BJD chief minister, has ended. Patnaik submitted his resignation to Odisha Governor Raghubar Das at the Raj Bhavan on Wednesday. Just four months after the consecration ceremony of the new idol of Ram Lalla in the grand Ayodhya temple, which was one of the biggest ideological promises in the BJP manifesto, the party lost from the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat of which Ayodhya is a part. District BJP organisation leaders feel that the people of Ayodhya voted against BJP candidate Lallu Singh, and not against PM Modi. Moreover, the local issues took centre stage as people were angry with the land acquisition that was happening around the Ayodhya temple and airport. \"BJP candidate Lallu Singh was of no use. He never listened to the grievances of the people of Ayodhya. People didn't want to vote against Modi ji, but against the local candidate. Whenever people approached him for some work, he always said you didn't vote for me but for Modi ji, go and talk to him. When Ayodhyawasis requested intervention to stop land acquisitions, he didn't help,\" said a local BJP leader. Awadhesh Prasad, a nine-time MLA, who is among the key Dalit faces of the Samajwadi Party (SP), defeated Lallu Singh by a margin of 54,567 votes. \"People were really happy with the work of PM Modi in Ayodhya and wanted him to again become prime minister. The voters have sent a message to the party high command by voting against the candidate,\" said a BJP leader who had been denied a ticket from Faizabad. Outgoing MP Lallu Singh was among the few leaders who first claimed that the BJP needed more than 400 seats in order to change the Constitution. This statement made the Dalits, who constitute 26 per cent of the population in Faizabad district, feel threatened. The Congress-SP combine of Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav further played on their fears by claiming loudly in rally after rally that the BJP wanted to change the Constitution in order to do away with reservations for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Castes (OBCs). The Faizabad Lok Sabha constituency with a Muslim population of over 5 lakhs has been a target of both the SP and BSP. This time, the SP was successful in consolidating both Muslim and Dalit populations, which decisively turned away from the BJP."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday chaired a meeting of National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners to deliberate on the details of government formation after the ruling coalition managed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha elections. Key NDA partners, including Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N Chandrababu Naidu, JD(U) leader and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and LJP (Ram Vilas) leader Chirag Paswan were among those who were present at the meeting. Even as President Droupadi Murmu is yet to formally invite the NDA to form the next government , sources told India Today TV that BJP's allies have already started pressing their demands for the Modi 3.0 Cabinet. The BJP alone bagged 240 Lok Sabha seats , falling short of the 272-majority mark, leaving the saffron party scrambling for support from its allies to form the government at the Centre for the third consecutive time. Here's a look at what NDA partners have demanded from the BJP: TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu, who fought both Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh in alliance with the BJP, is most likely looking for Lok Sabha Speaker's post in the new government at the Centre, sources said. It is also believed that Chandrababu Naidu is eyeing 7-8 Cabinet and one MoS berths. These berths include Road Transport, Rural Development, Health, Housing & Urban Affairs, Agriculture, Jal Shakti, IT & Comms, Education and Finance (MoS). \"I am experienced and I have seen several political changes in this country. We are in the NDA, I'm going to the NDA meeting in Delhi,\" Naidu said earlier in the day. The TDP and Pawan Kalyan's JanaSena Party, which won 16 and two Lok Sabha seats respectively from Andhra Pradesh, will play a crucial role in government formation at the Centre. Nitish Kumar, often touted to be a 'kingmaker' is expected to be bargaining hard and seeking more ministerial berths in the next Modi government. According to sources, the JD(U) has demanded 3 Cabinet seats. Earlier in the day, Bihar minister and senior JD(U) leader Vijay Kumar Choudhary said that the Nitish Kumar-led party was being wooed by the INDIA bloc, but it will remain with the NDA. JD(U) won 12 of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar and has emerged as a key player in government formation. The Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) is likely to press for one Cabinet and one state minister post is the next NDA government, sources said. LJP (Ram Vilas) pulled up a spectacular show in the elections and bagged all five Lok Sabha seats allotted to it as part of the NDA seat-sharing in Bihar. The party contested and won Hajipur, Vaishali, Samastipur, Khagaria and Jamui seats. Additionally, HAM(S) chief Jitam Ram Manjhi wants a Cabinet post in the new government, sources said. Former Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, who heads Hindustani Awam Morcha, made his parliamentary debut from Gaya. JD(S) leader and former Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy hinted that his party was interested in the Agriculture portfolio in the new NDA government, sources said. \"We don't have any such demand. Our priority is resolution of issues concerning Karnataka that have been there for long from the Centre. About giving representation (Cabinet berth) to Karnataka at the Centre, Narendra Modi will decide,\" Kumaraswamy said. The BJP and JD(S) fought the Lok Sabha elections together in Karnataka, which has a total of 28 seats. BJP won 17 seats and JD(S) two. Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena extended its support to the Prime Minister, but has also sought one Cabinet and two MoS berths in the Modi 3.0 government, sources said. In Maharashtra, the Mahayuti alliance – comprising BJP, Shiv Sena (led by Eknath Shinde) and NCP (led by Ajit Pawar) got 17 Lok Sabha seats while the Maha Vikas Aghadi comprising Congress, Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) and NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) secured 30 seats of the total 48 seats. Shiv Sena (Shinde) alone managed to win seven seats in the Lok Sabha and is seen as a crucial ally of the BJP at the centre."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story On June 4, the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was voted back to power for a third straight term. This day highlighted the beauty of Indian democracy. While the NDA, having secured 293 seats, is set to form the government, it faced a tough fight from the opposition, which won 232 seats. Neither the exit polls nor the political pundits expected such a surge in opposition numbers. The international media also looked with surprise and reported on the elections of the world's largest democracy. From the New York Times in the US to the Malaysian daily The Star, most news outlets highlighted how PM Modi was voted back to power but with a lower victory margin. Pakistani daily Dawn interpreted it in terms of the minority population. China's Global Times saw the lesser number of seats for the BJP as a constraint for Prime Minister Modi, saying his \" ambition to compete with Chinese manufacturing and improve India's business environment will be difficult to accomplish\". 'Needing Help to Stay in Power, Modi Loses His Aura of Invincibility,' was The New York Times headline for the news report on the Lok Sabha election result. The US media outlet wrote how though Modi would form the government, the election was a neck-to-neck battle between the BJP and the opposition, and how he will now have to rely on support from his coalition partners. \"And India, while extending Mr. Modi’s firm hold on power, learnt that there are limits to his political potency, even as he made the election, usually fought seat by seat, squarely about himself,\" it analysed. The London-based The Times newspaper guessed that \"India's poorest voters stopped the prime minister’s Bharatiya Janata Party from winning outright, forcing him to rely on support from the National Democratic Alliance.\" There is no data backing the claim that it was exactly the poor that made this happen. In fact, the welfare schemes of the BJP government and the direct benefit transfer (DBT) has been a hit with the poor in India. Its headline was 'India election results: Modi in coalition talks after losing majority'. They wrote, \"Modi was forced to turn to local partners from the National Democratic ­Alliance (NDA) for support after his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failed to retain its majority in the world’s largest general election, let alone achieve a predicted landslide.\" Germany's DW ran the main story of the 2024 Lok Sabha electio results under the headline 'A setback for PM Modi?' \"India election: Modi-led alliance seals majority The coalition led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party has passed the 272-seat threshold needed for a majority, official results show. But the opposition has made major gains,\" the DW reported. France's Le Monde wrote, \"Modi set to remain India's PM but fails to win by landslide.\" \" After 10 years of uninterrupted power, the prime minister won the parliamentary elections on Tuesday, June 4, with a narrow majority, at the end of a six-week marathon election.\" The Japan Times wrote, \"Narendra Modi vows to retain power in India even as BJP loses majority.\" \"The result is a stunning disappointment for the 73-year-old leader, who has been the main face of the BJP’s election campaign and built the party primarily around himself. Besides raising questions about Modi’s own future as prime minister, a weak coalition government will likely make it difficult for him to push through tough economic reforms or further his Hindu nationalist agenda, assuming he returns to power,\" read the piece in the Tokyo-based daily. Newspapers and media outlets in neighbouring countries commented on the result of the General Elections of 2024. The elections in India are especially important for its neighbours as several policies pertaining to international relations have implications on the neighbouring countries. They had a close watch on the Lok Sabha election 2024 too. The Chinese state-run Global Times headlined their story as, \"Modi claims victory with alliance winning only narrow majority.\" \"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed victory for a third term on Tuesday, as he released a statement on social media. Chinese experts said that, however, Modi's ambition to compete with Chinese manufacturing and improve India's business environment will be difficult to accomplish,\" noted The Global Times, which is owned by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC). \"Given Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failed to secure an outright majority of seats despite his alliance getting it, it will be hard for the prime minister to push economic reform but likely to play the card of nationalism, said experts, adding they expected that China-India relations are also unlikely to improve much,\" the report said. Dawn, the Pakistani news outlet, carried the headline 'India defeats hate, Modi left at mercy of Muslim-friendly allies'. \"Indian voters gave Prime Minister Narendra Modi a pyrrhic victory on Tuesday, handing his National Democratic Alliance (NDA) a clear mandate, but robbing the BJP of a majority on its own. Modi has been used to ruling wilfully with his own ironclad majority; 13 years as Gujarat chief minister and 10 as premier,\" wrote the Karachi-based newspaper, founded by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, with its tone of bias. 'Modi, allies to meet after humbling election verdict' is how the Bangladesh's Daily Star headlined the Lok Sabha election report on its website. \"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was set to meet his allies on Wednesday to discuss forming the government, a day after his Hindu nationalist party lost its outright majority in parliament in a surprise election verdict,\" wrote the Dhaka-based Daily Star. The Island of Sri Lanka headlined the election report as 'India’s Modi claims victory as he heads for reduced majority'. \"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has claimed a historic third win in a row in the country’s parliamentary elections, but his ruling alliance appears to have failed to win a large majority as predicted,\" wrote The Island. The Jakarta Post of Indonesia headlined the election results report as 'Modi celebrates victory in India vote, but falls short of landslide'. \"Commentators and exit polls had projected an overwhelming victory for Modi, whose campaign wooed the Hindu majority to the worry of the country's 200-million-plus Muslim community, deepening concerns over minority rights,\" noted the Jakarta Post. 'India election throws up surprise as BJP win with smaller numbers' was how the Malaysian media outlet The Star headlined its report on the 2024 Lok Sabha election results. 'India election: Modi’s BJP wins historic third term, but loses decade-old parliamentary majority' headlined The Straits Times of Singapore. \"India’s ruling alliance led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a historic third consecutive term, even as the party lost its decade-old majority in an underwhelming victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He now faces the prospect of a coalition government, which could slow policymaking but also temper Hindu-first instincts that have heightened communal tensions,\" Straits Times wrote."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Chirag Paswan, the chief Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) in Bihar, could be the NDA's biggest asset in Bihar. His party won all five Lok Sabha seats it contested in the state and Paswan is known to have always shown loyalty to the BJP. In an exclusive chat with India Today TV, Paswan described himself as \"Narendra Modi's Hanuman\" and said he would remain with the NDA. Chirag Paswan's loyalty to the BJP-led NDA has been unwavering. Even when his uncle Pashupati Paras broke from the LJP and went on to become a Union Minister in the NDA government, Chirag Paswan did not rebel against Narendra Modi. Pashupati Paras is the younger sibling of Ram Vilas Paswan, Chirag Paswan's father and founder of Lok Janshakti Party. In 2020, after the death of Ram Vilas Paswan, there was a split in the LJP and Pashupati Paras formed his own faction by breaking away with four MPs. However, the BJP's decision to offer five seats to Chirag Paswan's LJP faction and excluding Pashupati Paras from the seat-sharing deal in Bihar, seems to have worked in its favour. Chirag Paswan's party contested five seats - Hajipur, Jamui, Khagaria, Samastipur and Vaishali and emphatically emerged victorious in all. Even though the NDA's overall performance weakened this election with only 30 seats, as opposed to 39 in 2019, Paswan's party only made gains with a 100 per cent strike rate. Notably, even though the BJP only won 12 out of 40 seats in Bihar, Chirag Paswan does not seem to be leaving its side. Witnessing a setback with a poor showing in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, this is a much-needed boost for the BJP. Both JDU and LJP, its allies in Bihar, have done considerably well in Bihar this Lok Sabha election. The LJP got a vote share of 6.47 per cent in Bihar, comprising six per cent Dalits and the vote bank consolidated by Chirag Paswan this election. Chirag Paswan won the election from Hajipur, defeating RJD's Shiv Chandra Ram by a huge margin of 1,70,105 votes. Chirag Paswan's brother-in-law Arun Bharti has won from Jamui, party leader Rajesh Verma from Khagaria, Shambhavi Chaudhary from Samastipur and Veena Devi from Vaishali. In Jamui, Arun Bharti defeated RJD candidate Archana Kumari by a margin of 1,12,482 votes. In Samastipur, Shambhavi Chaudhary defeated Congress candidate Sunny Hazari by a margin of 1,87,251 votes. In Khagaria, Rajesh Verma defeated CPI (M) candidate Sanjay Kumar by a margin of 1,61,131 votes. In Vaishali, Veena Devi defeated RJD candidate Vijay Kumar alias Munna Shukla by a margin of 89634 votes."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai on Wednesday took a dig at DMK's Kanimozhi Karunanidhi after she mocked him for never winning an election. Annamalai was contesting the Coimbatore Lok Sabha seat but lost to DMK's Ganpathy Rajkumar . During a media interaction, Kanimozhi had mocked Annamalai's poll loss in Coimbatore and said the people of Tamil Nadu have made it clear that there is no place for the BJP. \"Annamalai's continuation as BJP's Tamil Nadu chief is not good,\" she added. Reacting to Kanimozhi's attack at him, Annamalai said, \"If my father was Karunanidhi, I too would have won elections by now. My father’s name is Kuppuswamy, so it will take some time for me to win elections.\" Annamalai also backed the BJP's campaign in Tamil Nadu and said it was not wrong to set an ambitious target. \"What PM Narendra Modi has done for Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the results are showing. Our vote share has gone up. We need to stay on the course,\" he said. Annamalai, a former IPS officer of the Karnataka cadre, joined the BJP in 2019 and became the president of the party's Tamil Nadu unit in 2021. He was contesting the Coimbatore seat against DMK's Ganpathy Rajkumar, who defeated him by over 1,18,000 votes. Candidates belonging to the DMK and its allies, including star nominee Kanimozhi, won by huge margins in Tamil Nadu, and the BJP-led NDA did not manage to win even one seat. Kanimozhi retained her Thoothukkudi seat by bagging 5,40,729 votes. Annamalai conceded defeat against the DMK candidate but also said that the NDA had created history as Narendra Modi would take oath as Prime Minister for a third term, a feat only achieved by country's first PM Jawaharlal Nehru before. \"This is a difficult task to come back to power for the third time. We regret that we could not send MPs from Tamil Nadu. Our vote share has gone up. This will be a learning step. In the next election, BJP will emerge victorious,\" Annamalai said. The BJP would look into what went wrong in the next one week and see how it can be rectified, he added. \"We accept the people's mandate. They wanted us to increase our vote share and that happened, but we could not win seats,\" he said. The DMK and its allies put up a splendid show in Tamil Nadu, winning all 39 Lok Sabha seats in Tamil Nadu. Thanking people, Annamalai said though there is a sense of regret that there is no party nominee was elected to Parliament from the state, he said his party will 'double' its work to get people's love and recognition."

The statement comes after the BSP did not win a single seat in the Lok Sabha elections. In a statement, Mayawati said the party had given ample representation to Muslims in elections, but the Muslim community failed to understand them. \"The party will give them (Muslims) a chance in the elections after a lot of thought, so that the party does not suffer a huge loss in the future,\" the statement read. Mayawati also said that the Muslims are a special part of the Bahujan Samaj Party, and were given representation by the BSP in previous elections, as well as the Lok Sabha elections. In a two-page letter issued today, Mayawati spoke about the Lok Sabha election results announced on June 4. The BSP did not win a single seat in the Lok Sabha elections this time, repeating its 2014 performance. The party bagged 10 seats in the 2019 elections which it fought in alliance with the Samajwadi Party. In the statement, Mayawati said her party will do a \"deep analysis\" of the poll debacle and will take steps necessary in the interest of the party. She expressed her gratitude to the Dalit community, especially the Jatavs, for supporting the party, but also expressed her displeasure towards the Muslims. The BSP had fielded 35 Muslim candidates, the maximum, in the latest general election."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The BJP won 303 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, way past the 272-majority mark, on its own. Expecting to better the margin in 2024, the party set a '400 paar' target for the NDA bloc and 370+ itself. However, the BJP was up for a rude shock on June 4 as it managed to win 240 seats, 32 behind the majority mark. The party, though, would still remain in power thanks to its NDA allies, who pushed the coalition tally to 292. The BJP suffered a setback in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Haryana, despite being in power in the Legislative Assembly in all these states. Even though the BJP-led NDA is coming back for another term, the weaker election performance, especially in strongholds like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, have left people wondering what went wrong for the BJP. According to assessments by BJP leaders, the party could not properly balance the caste equations that was largely responsible for its sub par show in Uttar Pradesh. Not only did the non-Yadav OBC vote bank left the BJP's side, the non-Jatav Dalit voters also shifted support to the INDIA bloc. Among the non-Yadav OBCs, the Khatik and Kurmi votes largely shifted to the Opposition. The Opposition's \"Constitution will be changed\" charge against the BJP also paved the way for support to be divided and the party could not counter it properly. In most poll campaigns for Lok Sabha, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi could be seen holding a Constitution booklet, alleging the BJP would make changes to the Constitution if it comes to power. Karnataka BJP MP Anantkumar Hegde had also claimed that the Constitution could be amended to undo the \"anti-Hindu\" changes, which is why the BJP needed a majority in Parliament. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) also had no support this time, failing to cut votes of the Congress-Samajwadi Party alliance. Most Dalit votes also went to the INDIA bloc, which won 43 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh. The BJP-led NDA could manage 36 seats. The lack of coordination between the government and the party members is being cited as the major reason for the inadequate performance. Party workers are angry with their neglect in the government, especially in Maharashtra. Fielding incumbent MPs as candidates in most seats also proved to be a wrong decision. Besides, the BJP welcoming turncoats into the party and fielding them as candidates was also not well-received. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was indifferent to the BJP's poll campaign this time and was upset with party president JP Nadda's remark during the polls. In an interview with the Indian Express, JP Nadda called the RSS an \"ideological front\" and that the BJP \"ran itself\"."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story After scoring a zilch in the recently-concluded Lok Sabha elections , the political future of Mayawati and her Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) appears to be bleak. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BSP managed to secure 10 seats when it contested in alliance with Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party. Even in the 2014 polls, the party, once dominant in Uttar Pradesh, had failed to open its account. The Bahujan Samaj Party's performance in the 2024 general elections indicates a significant decline in support, even among its core Jatav base. Earlier in the day, Mayawati said that despite the BSP giving it a \"proper representation\" in elections, the Muslim community is not able to understand the party. In a statement, the former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister said that her party will do a \"deep analysis\" of the trouncing and will take whatever steps that are necessary in the interest of the party. \"The Muslim community, which is an important part of the Bahujan Samaj Party, is not able to understand the BSP properly despite being given proper representation in the past elections and this time also in the Lok Sabha general elections,\" Mayawati said. \"So, in such a situation, the party will give them a chance in the elections after a lot of thought so that the party does not suffer a huge loss in the future like this time,\" she added. Notably, in the recent elections, Mayawati had fielded 35 Muslim candidates, the maximum in the latest general election. What adds to Mayawati's dismay is that BSP received a lower vote percentage than the Congress party this time. The shift of Dalit votes towards the INDIA bloc, primarily due to Congress and Rahul Gandhi's 'Bahujan' image, is a significant concern for her. It is estimated that Mayawati's vote bank has dwindled to around 9.39 per cent. More than a third of her core voters have shifted away. Not only have the Jatav voters decreased, but also a significant portion of non-Jatav Dalits, who were part of her base, have moved away. The large margin of victory of Chandrashekhar Azad in Nagina, where BSP was nearly obliterated, indicates a major shift in Dalit support. Nagina, a seat from where Mayawati contested her first election, has highlighted BSP's plummeting political fortunes. This time, BSP not only failed to save its deposit but also secured only 13,272 votes, finishing fourth. In stark contrast, Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan received 5,12,552 votes, indicating a massive gap of 4,99,280 votes between him and BSP. The results clearly indicate that the Dalits did not favour Mayawati. In the neighbouring Bijnor seat, BSP finished third. In all the 10 seats BSP had previously won, it finished either third or fourth. The party did not secure a second position in any constituency. The road ahead for Mayawati is increasingly challenging as BSP's votes have shifted towards Congress and the Samajwadi Party. Mayawati's 'Ekla Chalo' (go it alone) strategy and the label of being the 'B' team of BJP are proving detrimental to her party. With the next major election in 2027, the question remains whether Mayawati will join forces with anti-BJP alliances or continue to contest alone. However, her increasing isolation in politics suggests that only a miracle can bring BSP back to the mainstream."

BJP candidate Lallu Singh from Faizabad lost the seat to a candidate to Samajwadi Party candidate Awadhesh Prasad. \"You made the Ram Mandir an agenda throughout the country claiming that you brought the Lord inside the temple. How can you say that? Can a human being do that?\" he questioned. Abhishek Banerjee also said the BJP leaders were flying down to Bengal and urging people not to vote for the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress. \"See the irony. BJP leaders lectured people to give them 30 seats and said the Bengal government would fail, but now I am being asked if the NDA government will survive. Never underestimate the power of a common man,\" he said. The TMC leader also called the public the \"kingmaker\". \"I must say the kingmaker is the general public and not any political leader. Those who voted against the price hike, BJP's tyranny, communal and divisive politics - each and every poor and common man who voted are the actual kingmakers\" he added. The Trinamool Congress won 29 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal, while the BJP could win only 12 seats. Abhishek Banerjee also won the Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha seat, defeating BJP's Abhijit Das."

The Congress leader also asked the BJP to think about whether it has people's mandate to rule the country. \"It is a divine message that I think Lord Ram has given that the seat where the temple is situated, BJP has been rejected. I think we must recognise it as a divine message,\" Karti, son of former Finance Minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram, said. \"BJP built up a narrative saying they are going to win 400 seats, then they said 300 seats, and now they are below majority. So they must really take a hard look at their own performance and decide whether they really have the mandate to rule this country,\" he added. In one of the major setbacks for the BJP in the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections, it's sitting MP Lallu Singh faced defeat at the hands of Samajwadi Party candidate Awadhesh Prasad in the Faizabad parliamentary constituency, where the temple town of Ayodhya is situated. Awadhesh Prasad defeated sitting BJP MP Lallu Singh by a margin of 54,567 votes. Further speaking about the nationwide performance of the INDIA bloc, Karti Chidambaram highlighted the electorate's preference for a collaborative government. \"We need to really look at these numbers and read the inner message from them. India wants a collaborative and a consultative government. India does not want a government to be run by the mandates of one man or one and a half men. So, I think we need a more consultative, collaborative style of functioning of government in India, and that's the message which our nation has given in the elections,\" the Sivagangai MP said. Karti Chadambaram also hinted at possible future political realignments of JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar and TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu, calling them \"friends\". \"Nitish Kumar and Chadrababu Naidu are our friends. They continue to be friends. It is just that they are sitting on the other side of the table. They have been with us before, and I wouldn't be surprised if they come back to have tea or supper with us in the future,\" the Congress leader said. Karti Chidambaram also lauded Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin-led Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Congress's combined performance in the Lok Sabha elections . \"This is not a surprising victory in Tamil Nadu. This is an anticipated victory and all compliments to the Chief Minister for leading this front and campaign. It is for his developmental politics and also for the secular and federal agenda of the INDIA alliance,\" he added. The ruling DMK bagged a significant victory in the Lok Sabha polls 2024, winning 22 out of 39 seats, while it's INDIA bloc ally, Congress, secured 9 seats. The remaining 8 seats were won by other parties. The BJP could not manage to open its account in the southern state."

On being asked whether he would consider brokering a peace deal between the Meitei and Kuki communities, Arthur said, \"Life is not about brokering. However, as a citizen of this state and also as an elected member, it becomes my duty\". Arthur was speaking at a programme organised by the Congress's Manipur unit to commemorate the victory of both their candidates -- Angomcha Bimol Akoijam and AK Arthur. In the programme, Arthur also thanked voters from different communities, including Muslims, Meitei, Naga or Kuki, for extending their support and also added that, as a member of parliament from Manipur, his role has become very intense. In the Outer Manipur Parliamentary Constituency, the Congress candidate defeated his nearest rival Naga Peoples Front (NPF) and NDA common candidate Kachi Timothh Zimik by a margin of 85, 418 votes. In the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress won both the Inner Manipur Parliamentary Constituency and the Outer Manipur Parliamentary Constituency. While reflecting on the results, K Shanta, secretary of CPI, said the Lok Sabha results show that the people of the state want peace and prosperity and the winning margin of AK Arthur is a testament to that. K Shanta was also present at the reception ceremony representing INDIA Block Manipur which lends support to INC Candidates in the recently declared Lok Sabha election. Notably, Manipur has been strife-torn since May last year when ethnic violence broke out after a march by Kuki tribals in the hill districts to protest against the valley-dominant Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribes status. Since then, over 220 people belonging to both the communities, including security personnel, have been killed in the continuing violence."

Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Bhutan King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck will also attend the swearing-in ceremony. Mauritius PM Pravind Jugnauth is also likely to be invited. Modi is likely to take oath on June 9 as the BJP-led NDA scraped past the majority mark to win 293 seats in the Lok Sabha elections, sources said. The opposition INDIA bloc, defying exit poll predictions, secured 234 seats. After the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, India invited leaders of BIMSTEC countries to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Modi. The BIMSTEC, a regional grouping, includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. As many as 8,000 guests, including VVIPs, attended the event in 2019. In 2014, when Modi was sworn-in for his first term, all the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) leaders, including the then Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, attended the ceremony. On Wednesday, PM-elect Modi called Ranil Wickremesinghe and invited him to the swearing-in ceremony, PTI reported quoting sources. \"During the conversation, Prime Minister @narendramodi invited President Wickremesinghe to his swearing-in ceremony, which President @RW_UNP accepted,\" the Sri Lankan President's office said. Modi also had a phone conversation with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and the two leaders vowed to continue working together to achieve the vision of 'Viksit Bharat 2047' and 'Smart Bangladesh 2041', ANI reported. Sheikh Hasina, who was among the first foreign leaders to congratulate Modi on NDA's win, accepted the invite to attend his swearing-in ceremony. The formal invitations to the foreign leaders will be sent on Thursday. In 2019, 24 Union ministers took oath today along with Narendra Modi. Twenty-four ministers of state (MoS) and 9 MoS (independent charge) were also sworn in by the President at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. This time the Modi 3.0 Cabinet is likely to see greater representation from its allies as the BJP fell short of achieving a majority on its own."

Biden, who is currently travelling to France, personally made a phone call to the Prime Minister-elect to congratulate him. \"Congratulations to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the National Democratic Alliance on their victory, and the nearly 650 million voters in this historic election. The friendship between our nations is only growing as we unlock a shared future of unlimited potential,\" he said in a social media post later. “The friendship between our nations is only growing as we unlock a shared future of unlimited potential,” Biden said on X, which was soon followed by similar congratulatory messages by other senior members of his administration, including Secretary of State Tony Blinken. In a post tagging Biden on X, Prime Minister Modi said he was happy to receive the call from his \"friend\". \"Deeply value his warm words of felicitations and his appreciation for the Indian democracy. Conveyed that India-US Comprehensive Global Partnership is poised to witness many new landmarks in the years to come. Our partnership will continue to be a force for global good for the benefit of humanity,\" Modi said. In his congratulatory message on X, Blinken said, “The US looks forward to advancing our partnership with the Indian government and commends the estimated 650 million voters who exercised their right to vote.” State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said that the US congratulates Narendra Modi and the NDA on their victory in the 2024 Lok Sabha general elections. \"With approximately 650 million voters casting their ballots over the past six weeks, these elections represent the largest exercise in democracy in human history. We commend Indian voters, poll workers, civil society, and journalists for their commitment and vital contributions to India’s democratic processes and institutions,” Miller said. \"We look forward to continuing to further our partnership with the Indian government to promote prosperity and innovation, address the climate crisis, and ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” he said. Miller said the US will continue to look to expand its partnership with India. \"We work with India on economic matters. We worked with them to deepen people-to-people ties between our two countries. And of course, we work with them on a free, secure, prosperous Indo-Pacific. Those will continue to be our priorities,” he told reporters at his daily news conference. Responding to a question on India’s democracy, which many in the US doubted during the election process, Miller said: “India is, of course, the world's largest democracy, and the election that just played out over the last six weeks was the largest exercise of democracy in the history of the world. And we commend the government of India, voters, and poll workers for this massive undertaking.” Richard Verma, Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources, congratulated Indian voters, poll workers, civil society and all those who contributed \"to this democratic process\". “Look forward to continuing to work with” Prime Minister Modi and “the National Democratic Alliance to further our US India partnership for regional peace and security,” he said. India’s 2024 Lok Sabha general elections were the largest exercise of democracy in history, said Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell. “We look forward to continuing our work with the people of India and the newly elected government of Narendra Modi and the National Democratic Alliance to advance US-India ties,” he said. In a statement, USIBC Global Board of Directors chair and NASDAQ Executive Vice Chairman Edward Knight congratulated Modi on his re-election and securing another mandate. “We also applaud the people of India for demonstrating to the world the importance of active engagement in the democratic process as the world's largest democracy. India's global leadership has never been more important and USIBC looks forward to continuing to deepen our partnership. “The US business community, facilitated by the US government, continues to be vitally engaged with India and its business community as we look for more ways to promote growth between our nations,” he said. USIBS president Atul Keshap said, “This election is truly impressive as the greatest exercise of electoral choice in the history of our species. Yet again, the people of India have shown their great devotion to democracy and human freedom and have inspired the entire world.” Hundreds of millions of India’s citizens have spoken through the ballot, and awarded Prime Minister Modi and the NDA an historic third consecutive mandate. The US-India Business Council congratulates them and all Indians on the successful completion of the Lok Sabha elections, he said. “We look forward to working with the new government and all of India’s elected leaders to expand trade and investment between India and the United States, helping Indians to achieve their aspirations for greater prosperity and development. “Our shared prosperity hinges on deepening economic ties between India and America, aiming for a bilateral trade target of at least $500 billion annually between the world’s two greatest democracies. We remain committed to fostering a US-India partnership rooted in trust and cooperation,” Keshap said. In his replies to world leaders, including Russia's Vladimir Putin and UK's Rishi Sunak, in their congratulatory messages to him, Modi has underscored the strength of India's relations with their countries and his commitment to further strengthening it."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Telugu Desam Party chief Chandrababu Naidu's swearing-in as the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh has been pushed to June 12, sources told India Today. Earlier, he was expected to take the oath on June 9. The change in date came due to Narendra Modi taking the oath as the Prime Minister of India for a record third term on Saturday (June 8). Modi resigned on Wednesday and submitted his letter to President Droupadi Murmu ahead of his oath ceremony, which is likely to take place in the evening. The President accepted his resignation as the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers, and urged him to continue in his post till the new government assumed office. Chandrababu Naidu has emerged as one of the kingmakers in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)'s record third straight victory. He and Janata Dal (United) President and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar played crucial roles in ensuring the tide remains in favour of the alliance as the BJP failed to get a majority on its own in the face of a stellar performance by the Opposition-led INDIA bloc. Amid attempts by the INDIA bloc to bring the TDP chief on their side in the aftermath of the Lok Sabha election results, Chandrababu Naidu reaffirmed his decision to \"firmly stay\" with the BJP-led NDA. The TDP put up an impressive show in Andhra Pradesh, ousting Jagan Mohan Reddy's YSRCP that shrunk to only 11 seats in the Assembly elections. Meanwhile, Narendra Modi on Wednesday chaired a meeting of the Union Cabinet to take stock of the Lok Sabha election results and also discussed matters pertaining to the formation of the new government, sources said. This was the last meeting of the Modi 2.0 Cabinet and Council of Ministers. Later in the evening, Modi chaired an NDA meeting to deliberate on the details of government formation. Chandrababu Naidu is most likely looking for Lok Sabha Speaker's post in the new government at the Centre, sources said. It is also believed the TDP supremo is eyeing seven to eight Cabinet and one MoS berths. These include Road Transport, Rural Development, Health, Housing & Urban Affairs, Agriculture, Jal Shakti, IT & Comms, Education and Finance (MoS)."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Even though the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured a majority in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, setting the stage for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's third term, the BJP's dismal performance in Maharashtra has become a major concern ahead of state polls.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Although the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led NDA won 11 out of 14 Lok Sabha seats in Assam, the Congress snatched Jorhat, a seat where Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma personally took charge of the BJP's poll campaign. Himanta, in fact, had made the fight in Jorhat personal . Now, Himanta, the chief of the NDA alliance in the northeast, is facing rare dissent from within the BJP, spurred by the loss of face in Jorhat. Jorhat, one of three Assam seats that the Congress won, is where the BJP witnessed the biggest upset. Congress candidate Gaurav Gogoi defeated sitting BJP MP Topon Kumar Gogoi. Gaurav Gogoi emerged triumphant despite the BJP's aggressive campaign led by Himanta, who turned the seat into a prestige battle. The margin of the victory -- by 1.4 lakh votes -- was a loss of face for the BJP. Gaurav Gogoi isn't just another Congress candidate, he is the party face in the Lok Sabha. His emphatic victory in the prestige battle, however, led to an unusual rebuke from within the BJP against Himanta Biswa Sarma, with a couple of BJP MLAs publicly hailing Gaurav's win and congratulating him. The voices of dissent have also brought to the fore the old-vs-new tussle in Assam BJP. Following Gaurav Gogoi's big win at Jorhat, BJP MLA Mrinal Saika publicly criticised his party's campaign strategy. While Saikia congratulated Gaurav Gogoi, he attributed the Jorhat loss to the \"arrogance\" in the BJP campaign. \"Special congratulations to Gaurav Gogoi for your amazing win. This result is very significant in Jorhat in many ways. The outcome proved that money, big publicity, overdoses of leaders and arrogant speeches does not always help to win elections,\" BJP MLA from Assam's Khumtai wrote on X, on June 4. BJP MLA Mrinal Saikia congratulated Congress's Gaurav Gogoi on X. Mrinal Saikia, a former functionary of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), a banned militant outfit, is a two-time BJP MLA from Khumtai, a part of the Kaziranga (earstwhile Kaliabor) Lok Sabha seat. Saikia's congratulatory, yet critical post soon attracted a stern response from his leader, Himanta Biswa Sarma, who suggested Saikia might soon defect to the Congress. \"Mrinal Saikia did not congratulate Narendra Modi on his victory, but he did congratulate opposition party winner Gaurav Gogoi on his victory. Owing to this action of his, it is my belief that he will not be a BJP member for too long now,\" news website Guwahati Plus reported the Assam Chief Minister as saying. Soon after Himanta Biswa Sarma hit out at Saikia, the Khumtai MLA took to X to underline his long association with the BJP and called the Chief Minister's remarks nothing but speculation. \"I joined BJP impressed by these great leaders, who taught us to respect others and give due respect to people irrespective of their political affiliation,\" wrote Saikia on X, along with a photo of the BJP veteran trio, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishna Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi. \"I learnt today from HCM Himanta Biswa, sir, that congratulating someone from the opposition is a crime nowadays,\" the post of Mrinal Saikia added. Mrinal Saikia said he was influenced by BJP veterans, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishna Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi. However, Saikia isn't the only voice of dissent in the northeastern state that boomed after Gaurav Gogoi's Jorhat win. The BJP MLA from Guwahati East and the former state chief, Siddartha Bhattacharya also congratulated Gaurav Gogoi, and hailed the victory as the Congress leader's 'political coronation'. \"Although I did not go to Jorhat to campaign for the party, I assessed that Gaurav Gogoi had influenced the middle-class and the youth in Jorhat. I congratulate Gaurav and this is his political coronation,\" Bhattacharya told the media in Guwahati. \"This time Gaurav Gogoi has won this election on his own steam, unlike the previous victories in his father, Tarun Gogoi's name. So, this victory was all his doing,\" added former BJP chief Bhattacharya, who has been with the Saffron Party since 1995. The voices also make public the old-vs-new friction in the BJP in Assam. Earlier, during the Lok Sabha election campaign, former Minister of State for the Railways, Rajen Gohain, lashed out at Himanta Biswa Sarma for seeking Muslim votes, after speaking against them. The four-time BJP MP from Assam's Nowgong also cautioned that the newer batch of BJP leaders, many of whom had switched from other parties, were gradually sidelining the older members and tampering with the party's ideology, according to a report in The Hindu in April. \"The days of dividing the party into old and new camps are over. We hope the State BJP president (Bhabesh Kalita) will apprise our national president (J.P. Nadda) of such views for necessary action to be taken,\" Gohain was quoted as saying by The Hindu. Gohain had, in the past, accused Himanta Biswa Sarma of having an \"understanding\" with Badruddin Ajmal's All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF). In the run-up to the Lok Sabha election, Jorhat seat emerged as a prestige battle for the BJP and Congress, given its historical and cultural significance, which the BJP banked on. Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma had invoked Jorhat's association with the Ahom Kingdom, in a seat with a significant Ahom population. During the campaign, Sarma led multiple rallies and sabhas in the constituency to ensure the BJP victory. He even took a dig at Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi's Jorhat campaign visit, saying, 'people would rather see the Rhinos in Kaziranga than attend her rallies\". Experts had said that many a time, Himanta would conduct rallies, even without the local BJP candidate. Jorhat, as a Congress stronghold, was earlier represented by Tarun Gogoi and now contested by his son, Gaurav Gogoi. The recent delimitation had forced Gaurav to switch constituencies, which added to the personal stakes. Though Himanta Biswa Sarma has always been respectful of Tarun Gogoi, the feud between the two is no secret. It was Sarma's fight with Tarun Gogoi that made him leave the Congress and join the BJP in 2015. Himanta Biswa Sarma played a crucial role in the Congress party's return to power in Assam in 2011 and people saw him as the sucessor of CM Tarun Gogoi. However, Tarun Gogoi had other plans, and he had started projecting his son Gaurav Gogoi as the inheritor of his political legacy. Himanta, who had been a students' leader since the early 1990s, was sidelined. He even appealed to the Congress high command multiple times, but his pleas fell on deaf ears, resulting in Himanta quitting the Congress and joining the BJP in 2015. The anger that was simmering in the Assam BJP found a channel after the party's loss of face in Jorhat and Himanta Biswa Sarma is facing unusual rebuke from within the party."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Amidst a gripping political showdown, the 2024 Lok Sabha polls in West Bengal witnessed a riveting narrative unfold as the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) won 29 seats in the state, including Basirhat. Basirhat Lok Sabha seat, which includes Sandeshkhali, handed over a decisive mandate to the TMC as the party's Haji Nurul Islam received 8,01542 votes, while BJP's Rekha Patra managed to secure only 4,68,593 votes. According to the political experts, the BJP tried to encash the Sandeshkhali protests electorally by giving a ticket to Rekha Patra, a survivor of the Sandeshkhali violence. The TMC also changed its candidate from the seat and pitted its old loyalist-- Haji Nurul Islam-- in the fray in place of Nusrat Jahan. Despite the TMC sweeping all the other assemblies in Basirhat, it faced a great fight from the BJP in Sandeshkhali, where 95,862 votes were received by Rekha Patra, while Islam got 87, 475 votes. Interestingly, Rekha led in the Sadeskhali assembly segment by 8,387 votes. Sandeshkhali, under the Basirhat Lok Sabha seat, garnered attention over the past three months due to allegations of sexual assault and land grab. Women-led protests brought the constituency into the national limelight. As per the government data, around 54 per cent of the 18,04,261 voters in Basirhat belong to the minority community. In 2019, the TMC won the seat by 3,50,369 votes. In the 2021 Assembly poll, the TMC candidate won Sandeshkhali by 39,685 votes. But what were the factors behind the major swinging of votes for TMC? India Today decided to hit the ground and speak to locals. 56 year-old Dilip Basu who works as an LIC agent in Basirhat town said that he was surprised with the results. Even though he admitted that the elections were peaceful, he had his scepticism over the results. \"The elections were very peaceful, but I don’t know what happened during the counting. There was a lot of sympathy for Rekha Patra after the Sandeshkhali incident. Many people were stating that she had a good chance of winning but didn’t know what happened. I am very much surprised by the results of Basirhat. There was a lot of resentment against the corruption and extortion done by the TMC leaders. So I personally thought Rekha or BJP would win this time,\" Basu said to India Today TV. Debangshu Kayal, a 53-year-old businessman, who lives in the 17th ward of Basirhat municipality feels that Lakhi Bhandar had a major impact on the results. \"I felt Nuruls' margin would be less. Rekha would be able to give a good fight. However, that was not the case as per the results. There was a lot of pooling that happened, 82.9 per cent only on my booth. I thought after Sandeshkhali, Rekha would lose by a margin of 10,000 max, but the margin is huge. Laxmi Bhandar is a factor. TMC was able to tell people that if Mamata lost, then TMC would not be able to give Lakshmi Panda to people. That was a huge factor. Sandeshkhali factor was only restricted to the Hindus. However, Laxmi Panda was for both Hindus and Muslims. Women getting a thousand rupees was mega factor number one,\" Koyal said to India Today TV. Jayanta Ghoshal, veteran journalist and consulting editor of India Today also analysed the situation where he claimed that Mamata Banerjee’s pro-female schemes have always helped her in elections. He also cited that the BJP thought that Sandeshkhali could be Nandigram for them, but the sting operation where BJP local leaders of Sandeshkhali claimed that it was a set-up, backfired on the party. \"Women have been key voters of Mamata Banerjee. Even when she was the railway minister she made free monthly passes for women so that they could easily travel from districts to the city for their daily work” said Ghosal. He further explained the reason behind removing Nusrat Jahan against Rekha Patra and nominating Nurul Islam, who was a former MP and MLA. \"BJP tried to show that Sheikh Shahjahan as the symbol of a Muslim mafia oppressing Hindus in Bengal and Rekha their face. TMC did not go with a woman candidate but with someone who has been very popular in the area and has been known for his resistance against Shahjahan. So that too was a factor which was decided by both Mamata and Abhishek,\" said Jayanta Ghosal."

The Biju Janata Dal, on the other hand, secured victories on 31 seats and was ahead on 20 others. The Congress was a distant third in the Assembly poll race in Odisha, winning six seats and leading on eight others. If the BJP does manage to win 74 seats needed to secure a majority in the 147-member Odisha Assembly, it would mark the first time that they would form the government in the coastal state and end Naveen Patnaik's 25-year-old tenure. The elections for 147 Assembly seats in Odisha were held in four phases -- May 13, May 20, May 25, and June 1. The assembly elections were held simultaneously with the Lok Sabha elections in the state. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJD emerged as the single-largest party with 112 seats. The BJP emerged as the second-largest party with 23 seats, followed by the Congress with nine seats. The BJD contested all 147 seats, while the BJP, led by Manmohan Samal, also contested all 147 seats. The Congress, led by Sarat Pattanayak, contested 145 seats. Odisha saw a bitter political campaign with the BJP and the BJD, former allies, hurling salvos at each other. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP centred their attack around Naveen Patnaik's health, his aide VK Pandian being a non-Odia and bringing up the issue of Odia pride. On the other hand, the BJD pegged its campaign around the welfare works and schemes of the Naveen Patnaik government."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Shivraj Singh Chouhan led the BJP to power in Madhya Pradesh, defying decades of anti-incumbency. Then he led from the front to deliver all 29 seats in the 2024 Lok Sabha election to the BJP. Now, Shivraj has agreed to agri in Modi 3.0, joining the Union Cabinet as the agriculture minister. Shivraj Singh Chouhan's joining the Cabinet as the agriculture minister is interesting because he had turned down the offer once earlier. He is credited with having turned around Madhya Pradesh's economy and pulling it out of the BIMARU ranks with the state excelling in agriculture. The alignment has been facilitated as Narendra Singh Tomar, who was the Union Agriculture Minister in Modi 2.0, was moved back to Madhya Pradesh as the Speaker of the Assembly. The government is looking to reforms in the farming sector with eye on the wellbeing of small and marginalised farmers. The confidence of the BJP leadership is that Shivraj Singh Chouhan will play a key role in bringing about a change. Veteran journalist Deepak Tiwari wrote in his book ‘Rajnitinama Madhya Pradesh (2003-2018) Bhajpa Yug’ that PM Modi had called Shivraj Singh Chouhan to Delhi in 2014 and sought his opinion on him joining the Union Cabinet as the agriculture minister. Shivraj, according to the book, didn't refuse Modi then and there, but upon returning to Bhopal, there started a buzz that the 2018 Assembly polls would be fought under his leadership. This didn't go down well with the BJP leadership, according to Tiwari's book. Shivraj was unwilling to move out of Madhya Pradesh for a seat in the Union Cabinet. There was a buzz again in 2019, after PM Modi returned with a bigger mandate, that Shivraj would be joining Team Modi as the agriculture minister. But Shivraj stayed back in Madhya Pradesh. In 2023, Shivraj delivered a stunning victory for the BJP in the state polls , 163 of the 230 Assembly seats. In a surprise move, the BJP brass replaced Shivraj with Mohan Yadav as the Chief Minister. Shivraj, popular as 'mama' or uncle, was left without any official position."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story While the BSP's decline in Uttar Pradesh continues, a new contender has emerged. Young Dalit leader Chandrashekhar Azad. Azad, the driving force behind the Aazad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram), secured a resounding victory in the Nagina Scheduled Caste-reserved constituency of western UP, winning by a margin of over 1.51 lakh votes. Azad chose to run independently rather than joining the INDIA bloc, defeating BJP’s Om Kumar with 51.19% of the votes, reducing the BJP’s share to 36%. The BSP’s candidate, Surendra Pal Singh, garnered a mere 1.33%, trailing behind the Samajwadi Party’s (SP’s) Manoj Kumar, who secured 10.22%. This marks a significant shift from 2019, when the BSP's Girish Chandra defeated the BJP’s Yashwant Singh by 1.66 lakh votes. In Nagina, Dalits (mostly Jatavs) comprise around 20% of the population, Muslims about 40%, with Thakurs, Jats, Tyagis, and Banias making up the rest. Chandrashekhar Azad has set a transformative new tone for Dalit politics, especially within the BJP-dominated landscape, after clinching a victory by a significant margin. Now poised to embark on a new journey in his political career, Azad's rise has been nothing short of remarkable. It all began in 2015 when Azad first burst onto the scene, capturing the attention of the mainstream media with the formation of the Bhim Army. This grassroots organisation, dedicated to fighting caste-based discrimination and advocating for Dalit rights, quickly made waves. Azad's relentless drive and charismatic leadership drew thousands of Dalit youths to his cause, making him a prominent figure in the fight for social justice. Azad's journey has been marked by his unwavering commitment to Dalit empowerment and his aggressive stance on issues affecting marginalised communities. From leading protests against injustices to challenging powerful political adversaries, he has consistently demonstrated courage and tenacity. His efforts culminated in his recent electoral victory, where he secured the Nagina constituency by a significant margin, signalling a new era in Dalit politics. Originally from Chutmalpur in Saharanpur district and a law graduate, Azad, 36, founded the Bhim Army in 2015 to advocate for Dalits and other marginalised communities. He first gained prominence defending Dalits involved in clashes with the Thakur community in Saharanpur in 2017. His subsequent arrest and prolonged imprisonment under the National Security Act (NSA) by the BJP government only raised his profile amongst Dalits and minorities. Released in September 2018, Azad further solidified his position through his participation in the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests. Expanding his influence to Rajasthan, Delhi, and Madhya Pradesh, Azad transitioned into politics. He also took part in the anti-CAA protest of 2019 that helped him in winning minority support, adding to that Chandrashekhar raised his voice against the farmers' bills and participated in protests led by the farmer's union. After unsuccessful attempts to ally with the BSP, and a failed bid against BJP's Yogi Adityanath in Gorakhpur Sadar during the 2022 Assembly polls, Azad shifted his focus. Despite finishing fourth in Gorakhpur, he later aligned with the RLD, contributing to their victory in the Khatauli Assembly bypoll in 2022 against the BJP. Chandrashekhar's bold confrontation with Yogi Adityanath catapulted him into the political limelight of Uttar Pradesh. With unyielding fervour, he took aim at the Chief Minister across multiple platforms, demanding equitable treatment for his community. He fearlessly accused Yogi Adityanath of practising caste-based politics, labelling it as \"Thakurwaad,\" and called for an end to what he deemed as favouritism. Despite facing numerous challenges, including imprisonment and political opposition, Azad has never looked back. As he continues to advocate for the rights and dignity of Dalits, Chandrashekhar Azad's influence is set to grow, heralding a new chapter of empowerment and representation for India's marginalised communities. Despite the BSP's base remaining strong among Jatavs and Muslims rallying behind the SP-Congress alliance statewide, Azad appears to have won support from both communities in Nagina. With no BSP members left in the Lok Sabha, Azad is poised to champion the issues of Dalits and Muslims, potentially rising as an alternative to Mayawati and further weakening the BSP. Azad's victory is significant for two reasons. First, it was his determination to secure this constituency that led to the breakdown of alliance talks with the SP. Choosing to campaign solo, Azad's door-to-door efforts in Nagina paid off. Secondly, his win carries symbolic weight. In 1989, Mayawati won the Bijnor constituency, now part of Nagina post-2008 delimitation. Azad’s journey from Bhim Army chief to a rising political figure illustrates his resilience and growing influence among Dalits and minorities, positioning him as a formidable new force in Uttar Pradesh politics."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been making an all-out effort to make its way into Southern Indian states for some time now. In line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's southern push, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has reaffirmed its 'Focus South' by including 13 ministers into his Union council from the five southern states. Apart from the two of the Big 4 core ministries of finance and foreign affairs, ministers from the southern states have also bagged the Cabinet posts of aviation and heavy industries. Irrespective of its electoral tally in the five southern states, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, PM Modi has inducted as many as 13 ministers into the Modi 3.0 from these states. While the NDA lost 54 seats in the Hindi heartland, it managed to bag 51 out of the 129 Lok Sabha seats in South India. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the NDA won 30 seats in the southern states. In that election, the JDS and the TDP weren't part of the NDA. Kerela's Thrissur made history as Suresh Gopi won the seat to become the first BJP MP from the state. On the other hand, in Tamil Nadu, the saffron party drew a blank after a spirited campaign spearheaded by Annamalai. In Karnataka, one of the BJP strongholds in the South, although the BJP-JD(S) combine managed to win 17 seats , the BJP could not repeat its 2019 electoral performance. In the Modi 3.0, four ministers have been included from Karnataka , including Janata Dal (Secular) leader HD Kumaraswamy. The BJP's Pralhad Joshi has been named the minister for Consumer affairs and renewable energies . V Somanna and Shobha Karandlaje have also been given ministerial berths. In Andhra Pradesh, the BJP, Telugu Desam Party and JanaSena Party alliance has shown a stellar performance. The Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP won 16 out of 25 Lok Sabha seats. The BJP has won three seats, while Pawan Kalyan's JanaSena Party has won two seats. Three ministers from Andhra Pradesh have been given a place in the Modi 3.0. Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu, as a Cabinet minister, will take charge of the important Civil Aviation Ministry. TDP's Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar and BJP's Bhupathiraju Srinivasa Varma are named Ministers of State. From Telangana, where the BJP won 8 seats out of 17 Lok Sabha seats, Modi 3.0 will have two ministers. While G Kishan Reddy will head the Ministries of Coals and Mines, Bandi Sanjay Kumar has been named the Minister of State for Home Affairs. Although the BJP, led by Tamil Nadu's party president K Annamalai, could not open its account , key Cabinet ministries like External Affairs and Finance have been retained by Nirmala Sitharaman and S Jaishankar, respectively, both of whom hail from the southern state. Rajya Sabha MP L Murugan has been inducted as the Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting and Parliamentary Affairs. From Kerala, actor-politician Suresh Gopi has been handed over the ministries of Tourism and Petroleum as an MoS, while George Kurian, the BJP member from the 1980s, has been named the Minister of State for minority affairs, fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying. The allocation of portfolios shows that the BJP has kept its focus on South intact, and this is important as it tries to destroy the narrative of it being just a North and West party."

The exam, scheduled to be held on Sunday, June 23, was postponed on Saturday. The ministry said the next date for the examination will be announced at the earliest. The decision came against the backdrop of alleged irregularities in NEET-UG and the row over UGC-NET cancellation. The National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences on Friday said its officials had discovered that some people were trying to \"deceive NEET-PG candidates through social media platforms\". The NBEMS proceeded to file a complaint against the social media groups who were attempting to \"befool NEET-PG aspirants in the name of providing questions of NEET-PG 2024 for a considerable sum of money\". The testing panel further cautioned aspirants to not be lured or misled by people who claimed they accessed \"questions of upcoming of NEET-PG 2024 accessed through \"the authority\". A day after the advisory, the Health Ministry announced that the exam has been postponed. The ministry said the decision was taken as a precautionary measure to maintain the integrity of the NEET-PG Entrance Examination. The ministry said it has decided to conduct a thorough assessment of the examination processes to ensure their robustness and fairness. The fresh date for the examination will be announced at the earliest."

The two teachers, identified as Sanjay Tukaram Jadhav and Jalil Umarkhan Pathan, who teach at a government-run school in Latur, were arrested by a team of ATS's Nanded unit. Currently, they are being investigated by ATS officials. Earlier on Saturday, the Central governmnet shunted out National Testing Agency (NTA) Director General Subodh Singh and handed over the probe into irregularities in medical entrance exam NEET-UG to the CBI. The Education Ministry also set up a seven-member panel headed by former ISRO chief K Radhakrishnan to review the agency's functioning and recommend exam reforms. “We stand for transparent, tamper-free and zero error examination. A panel has been formed on exam reforms, strict action has been taken against officials and the case has been handed over to CBI,\" Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said. \"Students' interest will be safeguarded at any cost,” he said after a flurry of decisions amid litigation and protests in different parts of the country on the issue of alleged irregularities in entrance exams. The NEET-UG exam has seen students protest over allegations of a question paper leak and grace marks awarded to over 1,500 students. The grace marks were later scrapped and the affected students were offered a re-test."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Amid the NEET-NET controversy , Jharkhand's Hazaribagh has recently come under the spotlight for its connection to the last two high-profile paper leak cases, raising concerns about its role as a weak link exploited by the paper leak mafia from Bihar. According to sources within the Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of Bihar Police, Hazaribagh’s Oasis School was involved in the NEET paper leak where a question paper was found tampered with. The evidence of tampering was submitted in a report to the Union Education Ministry, prompting it to involve the National Testing Agency (NTA) and eventually escalate the matter to the CBI for further investigation. Shabbir Ahmed is the chairman of Oasis School from where the paper is suspected to have leaked. The principal is Ehsanul Haque, who is also the city coordinator of CBSE. Being the city coordinator of CBSE, Haque covers all centres in four districts in Jharkhand - Hazaribagh, Chatra, Koderma and Ramgarh - where the education body conducts exams. The EOU has found the role of the Oasis school suspicious in the paper leak case. On March 15, the paper for the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) teacher recruitment exam was also leaked from Hazaribagh. The modus operandi involved shifting about 268 candidates, 113 of whom were from Bihar's Nalanda district, to different parts of Hazaribagh where they were taught the questions and answers a night before the exam. Joint efforts by Jharkhand and Bihar Police led to the arrest of candidates and members of the paper leak mafia. The infamous Sanjeev Mukhiya gang emerged as a common thread in these cases. Sanjeev Mukhiya, whose son, Dr Shiv, is already jailed for involvement in the BPSC teacher recruitment exam paper leak, is alleged to have a substantial connection with Hazaribagh. According to EOU sources, Sanjeev Mukhiya's network uses Hazaribagh as a safe zone to operate across the Bihar border. The gang's activities encompass both the recruitment exam and NEET leaks. Dr Shiv Mukhiya was arrested on April 21 in Madhya Pradesh's Ujjain along with four associates over the NEET paper leak case. His name had also cropped up in an earlier case related to the NEET paper leak filed at a police station in Patna in 2017. Sanjeev Mukhiya, a resident of Shahpur Balwa village in Nalanda, considers the track from Hazaribagh to Nalanda as his operational stronghold. The EOU continues to track the Mukhiya gang's activities to curb their influence and ensure the integrity of examination systems. Sanjeev Mukhiya had allegedly accommodated nearly 25 candidates at a boys' hostel, associated with the Learn Play School in Patna on May 4, a day before the NEET exam. Reportedly, the candidates were provided with the leaked question paper and answer sheets at the same hostel. The EOU has alerted police teams in Nalanda, Gaya, and Nawada districts in Bihar, and has printed pamphlets to trace him and arrest him."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The central government has come under severe criticism over irregularities in the medical entrance exam NEET-UG, that was conducted in May this year. The issue has also reached the Supreme Court in which the petitioners have sought directions to Bihar Police to expedite the investigation in the case and file a report before the top court. The examination was held on May 5 across 4,750 centres and around 24 lakh candidates appeared. The results were expected to be declared on June 14 but were announced on June 4. As many as 67 students scored a perfect 720, unprecedented in the NTA's history, with six from a centre in Haryana's Faridabad figuring in the list, raising suspicions about irregularities. There was also a controversy over grace marks awarded to students to make up for the loss of time at six centres. The Centre later told the apex court that the grace marks were being scrapped and 1,563 students would be given an option of a retest. Amidst the controversies, here is a complete timeline of developments in the case: May 5: The NTA conducted the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) on May 5. After the exam, one Sikandar Yadavendu and two others were arrested by the Patna Police based on input about the paper leak. On Yadavendu's identification, the police also arrested Ayush Raj, a NEET aspirant, from the city's DAV college. Following further leads from these four accused, the police arrested nine more people from Patna , which included NEET aspirants, their family members and others. May 6: Patna police interrogated all 13 arrested individuals and registered a case at Shastri Nagar police station, after which the accused were sent to jail. May 10: The case was transferred to Bihar Police's Economic Offences Unit (EOU) and the accused were transferred to their custody. May 21: The EOU team wrote to NTA seeking the details and original copies of the answer sheets of as many as 11 candidates. June 4: The NTA declared the NEET UG 2024 results on June 4, the day of the counting of votes for Lok Sabha Elections 2024. June 12: The NTA shared the copies of answer sheets of the 11 candidates to Bihar Police's EOU. June 16: Amid a nationwide uproar, the EOU released confessions of the arrested accused which allegedly indicated an exchange of money for the question papers. The statements claimed that medical aspirants paid over Rs 30 lakh each to the 'brokers' for the question papers. During his interrogation, the 56-year-old junior engineer with the Bihar government, Sikandar Kumar Yadavendu, reportedly confessed his role and said that he was in touch with the families of some NEET aspirants, after which financials were bargained. June 18: The infamous Sanjeev Mukhiya gang's role emerged in the case. The EOW unit took Sanjeev Mukhiya's son, Dr Shiv, who was already in jail, and 10 others on remand in connection with the case. On the same day, a confession note by an engineer deployed at Bihar's Danapur Town Council (Danapur Nagar Parishad) revealed the involvement of a 'Mantri Ji' (minister) who allegedly recommended the stay of a NEET aspirant (one of the relatives of the engineer), his mother and other accomplices at a government bungalow in Patna. June 19: Sikander Yadavendu, the alleged mastermind of the paper leak, and a junior engineer in the Bihar government were suspended. On the same day, two candidates arrived at the Bihar EOU office for questioning. An EOU team also went to Delhi at the invitation of the Ministry of Education to present the developments in the case. Before the ministry, EOU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan presented all the shreds of evidence in the case. June 20: Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sinha accused RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav’s secretary, Preetam, of booking a room for Sikandar Yaduvanshu at the NHAI guest house. Tejashwi Yadav responded to the allegations, stating that the government should call and question whoever they want. Political statements between the RJD and BJP intensified. June 22: Bihar's EOU arrested six more people from Deoghar in Jharkhand . All were residents of Nalanda. On the same day, the EOU started preparing to file a disproportionate assets case against Sikander Yaduvanshu. The EOU team also submitted their investigation report to the Ministry of Education in Delhi on June 22. The report detailed the progress of the investigation up to June 21, including evidence and documents related to money transactions. Following the EOU's report, the Ministry of Education replaced the NTA DG as the first major action. Late at night, the investigation was also transferred to the CBI."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In a significant development surrounding the NEET and NET paper leak row , Bihar Police's Economic Offences Unit (EOU) said the digital locks of the NEET-UG question paper boxes sent by the National Testing Agency (NTA) to various examination centres had malfunctioned. These digital locks were supposed to automatically open before an examination commenced. However, at numerous centres, the digital locks failed and the boxes were opened manually, resulting in a delay in the distribution of question papers to the candidates. The issue came to the forefront on May 5, when the NEET examination papers were distributed late at several centres. As a compensatory measure, the NTA awarded grace marks to 1,563 candidates. This led to an unprecedented number of 67 toppers in NEET’s history. The EOU's investigation highlights that the delay was a direct consequence of the digital lock failure. Compounding the issue, it was earlier disclosed that due to delays, two sets of papers were distributed hastily at three centres in Haryana's Bahadurgarh- Vijaya School, SR Century School and Hardayal Public School. While the management of these schools confirmed the distribution of two papers, they noted that one set was later retrieved. Candidates were given an additional 30 minutes and grace marks were provided, but notably, only candidates at Hardayal Public School received these grace marks. At Vijaya School, a box was opened at 1:15 pm on May 5, while three remained unopened. When the NTA was notified about the issue, instructions were given to the officials to manually open the boxes. In the ensuing chaos, both sets of papers were distributed. According to the procedure, manual unboxing involves two locks- one with the centre observer of NTA and the sensor superintendent. This process is video-recorded by NTA. The question now remains- why did the digital locks fail to operate as expected? In response to the issue, the EOU on Saturday submitted its findings to the Union Education Ministry. Subsequently, NTA Director General Subodh Kumar Singh was replaced by retired IAS officer Pradeep Singh Kharola. The Centre handed over the investigation into the paper leak in NEET and NET to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)."

The development follows hours after the Centre handed over the investigation into the matter to CBI. The agency will take over FIRs registered in several states in connection with irregularities in NEET. Individuals arrested by state police will also be taken into CBI custody. The CBI will unearth the \"larger conspiracy\" in the matter, sources added. The decision to hand over the probe to the CBI came after reports of cheating, impersonation, and other malpractices in the examination process. In an official statement, the Ministry of Education stated, \"Certain cases of alleged irregularities/cheating/impersonation/malpractices have been reported with regard to the NEET examination. For transparency in the conduct of the examination process, the Ministry of Education, after a review, has decided to entrust the matter to the CBI for a comprehensive investigation.\" The NEET-UG was held on May 5 across 4,750 centres in the country and around 24 lakh candidates took it. The results were announced on June 4, ten days ahead of the expected date. Days after, there were reports of NEET-UG paper leak in BIhar . Patna Police arrested seven people, including four candidates, in connection with the case. The arrested candidates, in a written confession, said that they were provided with the question paper a day before the exam. A political row soon erupted, with the Opposition demanding that the medical entrance exam NEET be re-conducted. Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, however, said that the government won't imperil the future of thousands of aspirants because of a few \"isolated incidents\"."

The answer was -- \"the state where you get to know the answers before an exam is called Uttar Pradesh\". ' Uttar ' in Hindi also means answer. The purported test sheet also shows the teacher marking the answer '10/10' and complimenting the student. Shashi Tharoor shared the picture on his X handle, captioning it \" Shandaar \" (brilliant) with hashtag ' ParikshaPeCharcha'. Notably, Pariksha Pe Charcha is an annual event where Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacts with students, teachers, and parents to discuss issues related to exam stress, academic performance, and student well-being. In response, Himanta Biswa Sarma decided to give it back to the Congress MP in the latter's style of using expansive vocabulary. \"This gentleman frequently indulges in satirizing various cultures (first Northeast and now UP) with remarkably caustic words. He has succumbed to the beguiling whispers of lunacy, his mind adrift in the ethereal mists of derangement,\" said the Assam Chief Minister in a tweet. Tharoor's comment came at a time when the National Testing Agency (NTA) is marred with allegations of paper leaks of different entrance exams such as NEET-UG and UGC-NET. The Centre has sacked the chief of NTA, Subodh Kumar Singh. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is probing the allegations of paper leaks and has registered two FIRs so far."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Amid the alleged irregularities in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) case, a team of Aaj Tak, India Today's sister channel, arrived at the residence of Sanjeev Mukhiya in Bihar's Shahpur. Mukhiya had allegedly accommodated nearly 25 candidates at a boys' hostel, associated with the Learn Play School in Bihar's Patna on May 4, a day before the NEET exam. Reportedly, the candidates were provided with the leaked question paper and answer sheets at the same hostel. According to the details, Sanjeev had borrowed the space from one Prabhat Ranjan, known to him. The Economic Offences Unit of the Bihar Police reportedly quizzed Ranjan in connection with the alleged paper leak case. It was alleged the leaked papers were first provided to Sanjeev Mukhiya via a professor. On the day of the exam, the paper was made available to students, before them writing their exam. However, the candidates were unable to learn the entire paper due to a shortage of time. The name of one Ravi Atri, connected to Mukhiya, also emerged in the paper leak case, which the police were investigating. As details suggesting Mukhiya's involvement with the NEET paper leak emerged, the EOU has intensified efforts to arrest him. Reportedly, the EOU has alerted police teams in Nalanda, Gaya, and Nawada districts, and has printed pamphlets to trace him. The unit has also questioned many close associates of Mukhiya. Meanwhile, the Bihar Police was preparing to arrest him after the completion of court proceedings against him. Several people from Jharkhand were also arrested in connection with the case , as the police doubted the leaked papers reached Bihar from Uttar Pradesh via Jharkhand. Sanjeev Mukhiya's name had come up earlier when there were reports of an exam paper leak in 2010. He is known to mastermind paper leaks of several exams, including the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC). Later, he reportedly formed a gang, which operated for the same. Sanjeev's son, Shiv Kumar, was earlier arrested in the BPSC exam leak matter and is still serving a jail term. During investigations, it was revealed that Shiv Kumar had assisted in the paper leak of several exams. Sanjeev Mukhiya's wife, Mamta Devi, had earlier fought elections on a ticket from Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party."

NTA and Union Education Ministry officials were present at the examination centres. The retest took place from 2 pm to 5:20 pm. Nearly 50 per cent or 750 candidates did not appear for the NEET-UG examination. The exam was conducted after the NTA withdrew grace marks awarded to students who were compensated for loss of time due to delay in the start of the examination at six centres in Meghalaya, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Chandigarh. The affected students were granted grace marks and given an optional chance to appear in the exam. The re-conduct of the NEET-UG exam was announced following allegations of irregularities in the medical entrance exam, including paper leaks. Six students scored perfect 720 marks along with 61 others, leading to allegations of inflation of marks. \"While all other examination centres have changed, the one in Chandigarh, where only two candidates will appear, will remain the same,\" said a senior NTA official. \"Besides, officials from the agency and the Union Education Ministry will also be present at these centres. The step has been taken to ensure smooth conduct of the re-exam,\" the official added. On Thursday, Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan ruled out the cancellation of NEET exams for now, saying the government cannot jeopardise the careers of lakhs of students who cleared the exam rightfully because of isolated incidents of malpractices. Earlier, the NEET-PG exam, which was scheduled to take place today, was postponed, with the Ministry of Health saying the decision was taken as a precautionary measure to maintain the integrity of the entrance exam. The ministry said it had decided to conduct a thorough assessment of the examination processes to ensure their robustness and fairness. A fresh date for the examination will be announced at the earliest. The NEET-PG was the second competitive exam to be postponed after the UGC-NET was cancelled due to the exam paper being leaked on the darknet."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The owner and tenant of the rented house in Patna, where the arrested NEET aspirant prepared a night before the examination, has come out with his version, denying involvement in the crime. On May 4, a day before the NEET-UG medical entrance exam, nearly 25 NEET aspirants gathered at a rented accommodation in a building in Patna, which also houses a play school. This was allegedly done at the behest of Sanjeev Mukhiya , a member of a problem-solving gang and accused of leaking the question paper. Ashutosh, the tenant, claimed that it was his friend, Manish, who brought all the students at the house on May 4. He said he told Prabhat, the owner of the house, about this the next day and apologised. \"Manish asked me if he could bring some students to the house as they needed to prepare for the exam the next day. I asked him to speak to Prabhat (owner) and if he okays, I had no problem.\" According to Ashutosh, Manish told him that he spoke to Prabhat and the latter permitted him to bring the students to the house. \"He (Manish) said he would bring 4-5 students along with him. But many others came, at least 15-20,\" said Ashutosh. Ashutosh further claimed that he saw xerox copies in Manish's hands, which he gave to the students. \"I went to Jamshedpur the next day to meet a potential groom for my sister. My wife called me and told about the police raid at my home. This is when I dialled Prabhat and told him what happened.\" Prabhat, the owner of the house, denied reports that he knows Sanjeev Mukhiya. According to Prabhat, he gave the house on rent to Ashutosh a year ago and did not know who all arrived at the house on May 4. It is alleged that the leaked papers were first provided to Sanjeev Mukhiya via a professor. Mukhiya is on the run and the Economic Offences Unit of the Bihar Police are on his lookout. Sanjeev Mukhiya's name had come up earlier when there were reports of an exam paper leak in 2010.

The Nanded Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) detained Sanjay Tukaram Jadhav and Jalil Umarkhan Pathan , both teachers from Latur, on suspicion of involvement in the scam on Saturday. They were questioned and released on Sunday morning, but later re-arrested along with two others, Iranna Mashnaji Kongalwar of Dharashiv district and a Delhi resident identified as Gangadhar. An FIR (First Information Report) has been registered against all four under sections of the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024. The FIR alleges that the accused ran a racket of selling exam information to students in exchange for money. The ATS received information that Jadhav and Pathan were involved in such activities and raided their residences. The investigation revealed suspicious messages related to exam hall tickets and financial transactions on their phones. \"The investigation suggests that Jadhav might have passed on the hall ticket details to Kongalwar, who then forwarded them to Gangadhar in Delhi, suspected to be the mastermind behind the leak,\" a police official said. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by the Latur Deputy Commissioner of Police has been formed to further investigate the case. The NEET-UG exam has seen students protest over allegations of a question paper leak and grace marks awarded to over 1,500 students. The grace marks were later scrapped and the affected students were offered a re-test. Amid the raging controversy, the CBI took over the probe and filed an FIR in connection with alleged irregularities in NEET-UG on a reference from the Union education ministry. Special teams were dispatched to Gujarat and Bihar, where cases of question paper leaks have been registered by police."

During the exchange, Rijiju sought the cooperation of newly-elected Opposition MPs to ensure the Parliament session ran smoothly, with Ramesh calling the minister to \"walk the talk\". Rijiju responded and said he could be a valuable asset if he contributed to the House. The Congress leader then hit back with a reference to the grading system of the National Testing Agency (NTA), which is in the eye of the storm over the conduct of NEET exams. It all began when Rijiju said he would always be available to assist the members and looked forward to coordination from Opposition members to ensure the session ran smoothly. \"The first session of the 18th Lok Sabha begins today, the 24th June, 2024. I welcome all the newly elected honourable members. I shall be always available to assist the members as Minister of Parliamentary Affairs. I'm positively looking forward for co-ordination to run the house,\" Rijiju tweeted. Calling for a \"peaceful\" and \"productive\" Parliament session, Rijiju said, \"Today, as new honourable MPs pledge their commitment. I am reminded of the immense responsibility ahead. Under the leadership of PM @narendramodi ji, let us together work relentlessly for our nation's progress.\" Rijiju's appeal drew a response from Ramesh, who asked the Union Minister to \"walk the talk\". \"Actions will speak louder than words Mr. Minister. Walk the talk,\" Ramesh tweeted. In response, Rijiju agreed and called Ramesh an \"intelligent member\" and said he would be a \"valuable asset\" to the Lok Sabha if he contributed positively during the new Parliament session. \"Absolutely @Jairam_Ramesh ji. You are an intelligent member and you will be a valuable asset to the house if you contribute positively. Differences will remain amongst political parties in Parliamentary Democracy but we are united in our service to the nation. Looking forward to your cooperation in maintaining India's rich Parliamentary traditions,\" he said. However, Ramesh hit back at Rijiju and took a dig at him, saying, \"Thanks Mr Minister. I hope your certificate of my intelligence is not like the NTA grading. Is it with grace marks?\" The Parliament session, the first since the Lok Sabha elections, will see newly elected MPs taking oath , followed by the election of the Lok Sabha Speaker on June 26 and President Droupadi Murmu's address to a joint sitting of both Houses on June 27. The Opposition, buoyed by its increased numbers, is expected to be combative, focusing on issues such as alleged irregularities in the NEET-UG and NET exams, the relocation of statues within the Parliament complex, and the government's decision to appoint seven-term BJP MP Bhartruhari Mahtab as the pro tem Speaker. The 264th Session of the Rajya Sabha will also begin on June 27, and the joint session will conclude on July 3, resuming for the monsoon sitting on July 22."

The Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of the Bihar Police has arrested 18 people in connection with the case so far, they said. CBI officers are likely to collect evidence related to the case from the EOU, which had been investigating the matter until the Centre ordered a probe by the federal agency, they added. The CBI had on Sunday filed an FIR in connection with alleged irregularities in medical entrance exam NEET-UG, which was held on May 5, on a reference from the Education Ministry, amid countrywide protests and litigations by students for a probe into the allegations of paper leak. \"The CBI team is expected to visit the EOU office around 11.30 am and collect all evidence, including the pieces of the burnt question paper that was recovered from a house in Patna, mobile phones of those arrested, SIM cards, laptops, post-dated cheques and reference questions papers provided by the National Testing Agency (NTA),\" an EOU officer said. \"All those arrested are in judicial custody in Patna, and the CBI team may take them to Delhi for detailed interrogation by obtaining transit remand from a court here,\" he said. The CBI may file multiple FIRs in connection with the matter to probe the destruction of evidence, and also register disproportionate assets (DA) cases against some of those accused who are public servants, he said. \"A DA case may be registered against arrested accused Sikander Prasad Yadvendu, a junior engineer in Danapur Town Council, as he reportedly acquired huge assets that are disproportionate to his known source of income,\" the officer said. Yadvendu, originally from Samastipur, has been identified as the prime suspect in the case, he said. \"He has a history of involvement in criminal activities. Before becoming a junior engineer in 2012, he worked as a contractor in Ranchi. He was previously implicated in an LED scam worth Rs 3 crore. He has served a jail sentence for his role in that case,\" the officer said."

Newly elected MPs who are part of the Council of Ministers also took oath during the first sitting of Parliament since the Lok Sabha elections. A resurgent Opposition is gearing up to challenge the NDA government on several fronts. Buoyed by its increased numbers, the Opposition is expected to be combative, focusing on issues such as alleged irregularities in the NEET-UG and NET exams, the relocation of statues within the Parliament building complex, and the government's decision to appoint seven-term BJP MP Bhartruhari Mahtab as the pro tem Speaker. Catch LIVE Updates from Parliament Session 2024 here The 264th Session of the Rajya Sabha will also begin on June 27, and the joint session will conclude on July 3, resuming for the monsoon sitting on July 22. The session began with President Droupadi Murmu administering the oath to BJP's Bhartruhari Mahtab as the pro tem Speaker. Mahtab then called upon Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take oath as a member of the House, followed by the oath-taking ceremony for other newly elected MPs. The Opposition has slammed Mahtab's appointment, claiming that Congress's Kodikunnil Suresh, an eight-term Lok Sabha MP, was overlooked by the government. Opposition has accused the government of flouting conventions and disregarding Suresh's seniority. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju addressed concerns over the appointment, stating, \"I met DMK Parliamentary Party leader TR Baalu. Everyone agrees that pro tem Speaker has never been an issue in the history of the Indian Parliament and the appointment of pro tem Speaker is basically to administer oath to the newly elected members and help in the election of the new Speaker.\" Ahead of today's session, Rijiju welcomed the new lawmakers, stating, “The First Session of 18th Lok Sabha begins today, the 24th June, 2024. I welcome all the new elected hon'ble members. I shall be always available to assist the members as Minister of Parliamentary Affairs. I'm positively looking forward for co-ordination to run the house.” Congress leader Jairam Ramesh replied, “Actions will speak louder than words Mr. Minister. Walk the talk.” MPs from the INDIA bloc have planned a symbolic protest by gathering near Gate No. 2 of the old Parliament building, where the statue of Mahatma Gandhi once stood. This statue, along with others, was relocated to a new area called Prerna Sthal. A senior opposition leader told news agency PTI that some MPs will hold copies of the Constitution of India and walk down to the Parliament building. The Opposition is poised to address several contentious issues, especially the allegations paper leaks, cheating and corruption in the NEET-UG and NET exams. Congress is already on the attack, with party chief Mallikarjun Kharge alleging that the National Testing Agency was serving the \"devious interests\" of the BJP and RSS. In response to the controversy, the government has removed the NTA chief and established an expert committee to recommend exam reforms."

The court asked the petitioner to make his point during the next hearing on the matter on July 8. The petitioner sought an urgent hearing of the plea seeking a probe into the NEET-UG row by ED and CBI and a case being filed against the accused under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). However, the Supreme Court refused to hear the matter. On June 20, the Supreme Court paused all cases on the alleged leaks and malpractices pertaining to the NEET-UG 2024 exam in various High Courts. A bench constituting Justice Vikram Nath and Justice SVN Bhatti issued a notice on the petitions by the National Testing Agency (NTA) to transfer all NEET-related pleas in seven High Courts and get them heard together in the Supreme Court. The bench fixed July 8 for their next hearing. Furthermore, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Centre and the NTA on petitions seeking the cancellation of the NEET-UG 2024 and a court-monitored probe into the alleged irregularities in the medical entrance examination. The Supreme Court heard a total of 14 petitions during the hearing. Of these, 10 were filed by 49 students and a student organisation called 'Student Federation of India'. Meanwhile, the remaining four were submitted by the NTA. On June 19, the Supreme Court refused to halt the NEET counselling, and also declined to direct the CBI to take up the probe into the alleged paper leaks and malpractices. The NEET-UG 2024 was held on May 5 across 4,750 centres and around 24 lakh candidates appeared for the medical entrance exam."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The NEET UG-2024 examination scandal, which surfaced following suspiciously perfect scores by 67 students, has been one of the most significant exam leak cases, shedding light on the current state of the country’s Public Examination System. The 31-day investigation by Bihar Police's Economic Offences Unit (EOU) has revealed the extent of the breach, unravelling a sophisticated criminal network operating across state lines. The NEET UG-2024 examination, held on May 5, 2024, raised immediate red flags when the results were announced. A total of 67 students achieved a perfect score of 720/720, an anomaly that quickly attracted scrutiny. Medical students and educators voiced their concerns, flagging irregularities and demanding an investigation. On the day of the exam, the Patna Police (Shastri Nagar Police Station) registered a case of alleged paper leak based on a tip, which led to raids and arrests under sections 407, 408, 409, and 120(B) of the IPC. In total, 13 people were arrested in this case by the Patna Police. The case was filed based on the statement of Shastrinagar SHO, Amar Kumar, who had received information through his personal network about alleged malpractices by NEET aspirants. The informant reported seeing a Duster Car carrying NEET aspirants involved in the paper leak. Due to the seriousness of the case, the EOU took over the investigation on May 17, 2024, forming a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to delve deeper into the matter. Through intelligence gathering and technical surveillance, the EOU identified and arrested two additional key suspects who were main masterminds of the question paper leak. The suspects were apprehended in a dramatic raid at a farmhouse in Devipur, Jharkhand. One of the arrested individuals, Baldev Kumar alias Chintu, was a crucial link to Sanjeev Kumar alias Lutan Mukhiya, the notorious leader of the gang. Baldev Kumar had received the solved NEET question paper PDF on the morning of the exam. Using a Wi-Fi printer at Learn Boys Hostel and Play School in Nandlal Chhapra, he and his accomplices printed copies and distributed them to groups of candidates. The candidates were brought to this location under strict confidentiality, using designated drop-off points and taxis to avoid detection. Mukesh Kumar, the taxi driver, was also arrested, and his vehicle was seized. The investigation achieved a significant breakthrough when NTA provided a copy of the reference question paper, which matched with the half-burnt question paper seized from Learn Boys Hostel. The serial code on the seized paper corresponded to an examination centre in Hazaribagh, Jharkhand. Preliminary investigations revealed tampered packing of question papers, indicating a breach at the distribution level. The SIT verified the chain of custody for these papers, gathering statements from personnel at the examination centre, the SBI bank branch, and Blue Dart Company offices. It was discovered that several security standards prescribed by NTA were not fully complied with, allowing the tampering to go undetected. Further interrogations led to the arrest of three more individuals who provided duplicate SIM cards and mobile phones to the gang. These arrests revealed the involvement of an organised interstate professional gang. Duplicate SIM cards and mobile phones were recovered, and an additional case was registered under the Economic Offences Police Station against the accused. Baldev Kumar's interrogation exposed the elaborate scheme orchestrated by Sanjeev Kumar alias Lutan Mukhiya. The gang meticulously planned the leak, leveraging technology and a network of accomplices. Candidates were tutored on the leaked papers and transported discreetly, ensuring minimal exposure. 1. Baldev Kumar alias Chintu: Central figure in the leak, arrested from Devipur, Jharkhand. 2. Mukesh Kumar: Taxi driver who facilitated candidate transport 3. Panku Kumar: Provided duplicate SIM cards and shelter 4. Rajeev Kumar alias Karu: Involved in providing logistical support 5. Paramjeet Singh alias Bittu: Part of the logistical and technical support network With the investigation uncovering a widespread network, the case has now been handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for further action. The EOU's efforts have highlighted significant lapses in the security protocols for handling exam papers, prompting calls for stricter measures. The NEET UG-2024 paper leak has cast a shadow on the integrity of one of India’s most crucial entrance exams. The 42-day investigation by the Patna Police followed by Bihar’s EOU has been a testament to the importance of vigilance and robust security in maintaining the sanctity of educational assessments."

While information technology shares gained, a decline in shares of heavyweight banking and financial services companies dented sentiments on Dalal Street. The top five gainers on the Nifty50 were Bharti Airtel, LTIM, Hindalco, Shriram Finance and Tata Steel. On the other hand, the top drags were Ultratech Cement, Adani Enterprises, L&T, Nestle India and Tata Motors. Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said, “The domestic market witnessed minor profit booking amid concerns over the slow progress of the monsoon, resulting in underperformance in the FMCG sector.” “The heatwave in Northern India is driving consumer durables stocks up. The global markets were subdued as weak guidance from Accenture led to profit booking in US tech stocks. Conversely, domestic IT stocks saw buying interest as market participants appeared to have factored in weaker earnings,” Nair added. “Attention is now focused on the upcoming GST meeting, where the potential rationalization of GST rates in certain sectors is under discussion,” he said."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The government is considering significant tax cuts for lower-income individuals in the upcoming Budget 2024, marking the first such relief in seven years, reported Bloomberg. This move is part of a broader package of consumption-boosting measures worth over Rs 50,000 crore, added the report, quoting sources familiar with the discussions. Officials in the Ministry of Finance are exploring proposals to reduce taxes for consumers with the highest propensity to spend. Salaried taxpayers earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh annually, currently taxed at rates ranging from 5% to 20% under the new income tax regime, could benefit from these changes. There is also the potential introduction of a new tax slab. In addition, media reports indicate that the exemption limit under the new tax regime could increase from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh . There are also chances that tax slabs under the old income tax regime may also be rationalised . Although the specifics of the plan are still under development, a final decision will be made closer to the budget announcement in July, pending approval from the prime minister’s office. Despite potential revenue losses from these tax changes, the government aims to maintain its fiscal deficit target of 5.1% of gross domestic product for the current financial year. Almost half of the Rs 50,000 crore measures will come from tax cuts, with the remainder allocated to other programs. Discussions include raising the annual cash payment to small farmers from Rs 6,000 to Rs 8,000, increasing payments under the minimum job guarantee program, and expanding financial support for women farmers. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is currently holding pre-budget consultations with stakeholders, including economists, trade unions, and industry chambers. Reports suggest the full budget may be announced on July 22."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Finance Ministry will conduct the 53rd Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council Meeting in New Delhi today (June 22). The meeting will be chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. While the meeting's agenda remains undisclosed, the Council is expected to address several key matters. The session marks the first GST Council meeting in eight months, following the 52nd meeting on October 7, 2023, where a 28% levy on online gaming, casinos, and horse racing was decided. The review of this levy, initially scheduled for April 2024, was postponed in the March meeting. Here are some of the key expectations from today’s meeting: The government is anticipated to review the 28% GST on the full face value of bets by online gaming companies. Last year, amendments to GST laws included online gaming, casinos, and horse racing as taxable actionable claims. The review, initially planned for April 2024, has yet to occur. The online gaming industry faces a tax liability of approximately Rs 2 lakh crore, which they have contested in court. The Supreme Court is expected to hear their appeals in July. Following the Council's decision, over 70 show cause notices have been issued to online gaming companies for alleged GST evasion of over Rs 1.12 lakh crore during the 2022-23 and 2023-24 financial years. Experts suggest the GST Council has two options: to refrain from adjustments while the issue is in litigation or to rectify the decision by eliminating the retroactive enforcement of the 28% GST. Ranjeet Mahtani, Partner at Dhruva Advisors, told Business Today that the GST Council is “expected to take up multiple issues like rate structure overhauling and rate rationalisation, addressing concerns of inverted duty structure, and providing clarifications on the newly introduced GST on corporate guarantees”. The Council may also discuss recommendations made by the Standing Committee on Chemicals and Fertilisers in February to reduce GST on nutrients and raw materials for the benefit of fertiliser manufacturing companies and farmers. Currently, fertilisers are charged a 5% GST rate, while raw materials like Sulphuric Acid and Ammonia face an 18% GST. Previous discussions to reduce these rates were held in the 45th and 47th GST Council meetings in September 2021 and June 2022, but no changes were recommended. There have been ongoing proposals to include fuel within the GST framework to establish consistent pricing for essential energy resources. However, some states have opposed this idea due to concerns over potential revenue loss from fuel taxes. Integrating petrol into the GST regime, where the highest tax rate is 28 percent, could lead to significant price reductions. Currently, petroleum products are subject to central excise duties and state-level value-added taxes (VAT), resulting in price disparities across states and contributing to higher retail prices. Shivam Mehta, Executive Partner at Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan Attorneys, said, “As hinted by the finance minister recently, spirited discussions regarding the inclusion of petrol, diesel, ATF, natural gas, and selected petroleum products within the ambit of GST have been taking place not just within the corridors of power but also within the industry. How far these requests will be met, however, will depend on the Centre taking on board the states.\""

Currently, petroleum products are subject to central excise duties and state-level value-added taxes (VAT), resulting in price disparities across states and contributing to higher retail prices. The government could receive an unexpected windfall of Rs 70,000 crore through a strong GST compensation cess, even after repaying loans taken on behalf of states during the Covid-19 period, reported The Economic Times. This additional cess is imposed on items deemed as \"sin goods,\" including pan masala, cigarettes, carbonated beverages, and automobiles, which already attract the maximum 28% GST rate. A senior official mentioned in an ET report said “going by the collection trend we would be able to make a prepayment of all the loans much ahead of the March 2026 deadline (and) would also be left with about Rs 65,000-70,000 crore.” The Centre has yet to decide on the use of this extra cess amount, but officials expect the issue to resonate in the GST Council meeting on Saturday when discussion begins on rate rationalisation. The report further suggested that the GST council may also set a timeframe for the Group of Ministers (GoM) on rate rationalisation to submit a report. The GoM has been reconstituted twice in the last year and is now headed by Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary. Additionally, the council is likely to vet amendments to the GST law regarding decisions taken in the previous meeting in October last year. This includes giving up the right to tax Extra Neutral Alcohol (ENA) used for human consumption to states, allowing them to continue levying VAT, while ENA for industrial use will continue to be taxed at 18% under the GST."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The 53rd GST Council meeting , chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, made a host of recommendations relating to taxation, tax exemption on services provided by Indian Railways and biometric-based Aadhaar authentication to check fake invoicing. Sitharaman, addressing a press conference, said the Centre's intention was clear on bringing petrol and diesel under GST and left it to the states to come on board and decide the GST rate on fuel. The council has suggested a uniform 12% GST on all solar cookers, whether it has a single or dual energy source. Services provided by Indian Railways to the common person, including sale of platform tickets, facility of retiring rooms, waiting rooms, cloakroom services, battery operated car services are now exempted from GST. Hostels for students located outside educational institutions are also exempted from GST. For students and working professionals, the council has recommended exempting accommodation services having a value of supply up to Rs 20,000 per person per month. The council has recommended a uniform rate of 12% on all milk cans, irrespective of the construction material. \"They have a standard shape so that will determine what is a milk can and what is not,\" she said. A uniform GST rate of 12% will be applicable on all carton boxes and cases of both corrugated and non-corrugated paper or paper board. \"This will in particular help the apple growers of Himachal Pradesh, J&K,\" the Finance Minister said. All types of sprinklers, including fire water sprinklers, will attract 12% GST, Sitharaman said. The Union Minister said biometric-based Aadhaar authentication would be rolled out on an all-India basis. \"This will help us to combat fraudulent input tax credit claims made through fake invoices in the cases,\" she said. To help small taxpayers, the council has recommended extending the time limit to furnish the details and the returns in the form GSTR 4 from April 30 to June 30. The GST Council has also recommended waiving interest and penalties for demand notices that have been issued under Section 73 of the GST Act, including cases not involving fraud, suppression or misstatements. To reduce government litigation, the council has recommended a monetary limit of Rs 20 lakh for GST appellate tribunal, Rs 1 crore for High Court and Rs 2 crore for Supreme Court for filing of appeals by the department."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story As the government prepares to present the full budget for 2024, there is a buzz of anticipation among industry players and the public. Numerous pre-budget consultations have been held, with various stakeholders submitting their proposals to the government. Subhrakant Panda, Immediate Past President of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), met with the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on June 20. Panda highlighted the need to keep supporting the growth momentum by boosting demand, focusing on infrastructure development, addressing food inflation, supporting Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), and prioritising innovation and research & development. “We look forward to a prudent budget that builds upon the strengths of the Indian economy for accelerated growth and remains committed to fiscal consolidation,” said Panda. Maintain thrust on investments - FICCI recommends the government continue its focus on public capital expenditure (capex) for physical, social, and digital infrastructure. It suggests increasing the capex outlay for FY25 by 25% over the Revised Estimate (RE) for FY24 to Rs 11.8 lakh crore. Prioritise innovation and research & development - To operationalise the Rs 1 lakh crore corpus announced in the Interim Union Budget for research and innovation in sunrise sectors, FICCI suggests focusing on developing ideas from early-stage research to implementation levels that generate cash flow. They propose reviewing the current Patent Box regime and setting up innovation clusters that bring together private sector, academia, investors, start-ups, and government-funded R&D institutions. Simplification of the tax regime - FICCI calls for simplifying the Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) provisions and capital gains tax regime. They recommend only three TDS rate structures and simplifying capital gains tax into broad categories for different assets. They also propose introducing a new independent Dispute Resolution Forum and initiating GST 2.0 reforms with fewer tax slabs and minimal friction in achieving pass-through of input tax credits. Enable MSMEs to meet liquidity and financial needs -FICCI suggests revising the qualifying turnover criterion for mandatory registration of companies on the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platform from Rs 500 crore to Rs 250 crore. They also propose that every tax invoice raised by a GST-registered MSME should automatically reflect on the respective TReDS platform, making it easier for financial institutions to provide funds to MSMEs. Exports boost - FICCI recommends revising rates of duty drawback and Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) to make Indian exports competitive. They also suggest developing a blockchain-based single portal for all trade-related compliances and increasing cross-border paperless trade through electronic exchange of customs declarations and certificates. Strengthen agri-ecosystem - To improve agricultural yields, FICCI proposes launching a mission for the bottom 100 districts and a national program to develop farm technicians. They also recommend creating a research network through collaboration between the private sector and government agri-research institutions and setting up a national board for Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs). Provide acceleration to tourism - FICCI suggests granting infrastructure status to tourism projects with a capex above Rs 50 crore and creating a ‘Tourism Development Fund’ co-financed by the Centre and States to support ancillary infrastructure development in new destinations and remote districts. Continue to promote sustainability - FICCI urges the government to release a National Taxonomy for Green Finance and create pathways for green transition across sectors. They also recommend launching a national vision document for a circular economy and reviewing the Priority Sector Lending framework to include climate adaptation and mitigation activities. Addressing food inflation - To tackle food inflation, FICCI suggests setting up a Food Inflation & Response Strategy Team (FIRST) under the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to create a coordinated framework for addressing food inflation through logistical strategies in the short term and agricultural production and distribution planning in the long term. Enable affordable financing for last mile mobility electrification -FICCI proposes introducing the SIDBI EV4ECO Scheme to support 10,000 electric three-wheeler passenger carriers (L5M auto rickshaws) to accelerate the growth of last mile mobility electrification. These recommendations by FICCI aim to create a balanced budget that addresses current economic challenges while laying a strong foundation for future growth."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Benchmark stock market indices opened lower on Monday, dragged down by a decline in financial services and banking stocks. The S&P BSE Sensex fell 222.63 points to 76,987.27 at 10 am, while the NSE Nifty50 dipped 76 points to 23,425.1. Most of the broader market indices, including small and midcaps, fell in early trade after The Economic Times reported that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) was investigating allegations of “front-running” at Quant Mutual Fund. It may be noted that most of the Nifty sectoral indices also fell in early trade as volatility spiked. The top five gainers on the Nifty50 were Sun Pharma, Power Grid, M&M, TCS and ICICI Bank. On the other hand, the top losers were IndusInd Bank, Cipla, Tata Steel, Adani Ports and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Among individual stocks, Delta Corp tanked over 7% in early trade after the GST Council Meeting skipped discussing a review of taxes on online gaming companies. Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said, “The consolidation phase in the market is likely to continue. The near-term strength in the market is likely to come from Bank Nifty assisted by institutional buying notably from FIIs who have turned buyers last week. However, Sebi investigation in the Quant Mutual Fund is a slight sentiment negative for the market.” Vijayakumar also highlighted that the market is experiencing a sectoral shift, with profit booking occurring in overvalued sectors and capital moving into fairly valued large-cap stocks. “There is a likelihood of the rupee turning stable with a positive upward bias in the near term on expectations of big debt inflows after the inclusion of India in the Global Bond EM Index later this month. This can act as a trigger for more FII inflows into equity, going forward,” he added."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is investigating Quant Mutual Fund, one of the country’s fastest-growing asset managers, over alleged front-running activities, reported The Economic Times. Front-running is an illegal practice where trades are made based on privileged information before a larger client executes those trades. As part of its probe, Sebi has conducted search and seizure operations at Quant’s head office in Mumbai and at the addresses of suspected beneficiaries in Hyderabad, according to sources quoted in the ET report. Alerts from Sebi’s surveillance system indicated that transactions of certain entities were closely matching with those of Quant Mutual Fund, raising suspicions of information leakage. A source close to the investigation mentioned, “Sebi's surveillance system threw up alerts that transactions of the suspected entities are matching with Quant Mutual Fund's transactions. How does it match?” Therefore, Sebi suspects that a dealer from Quant or a broking firm handling the fund’s orders might have leaked trade information. During the search operations, Sebi seized digital devices, including mobile phones and computers, to gather evidence. The examination of these devices will help identify who was sharing confidential trade information, added the source. Based on initial findings, Sebi plans to question individuals with access to Quant’s trade information. The focus is on executives who knew the size and timing of orders and could have passed this information to external beneficiaries. Quant Mutual Fund has also issued a clarification on the matter, confirming that it has received inquiries from Sebi and assured investors that it is \"fully committed\" to cooperating with the market regulator. It said, \"As a policy, we don’t comment on the media reports. However, here is an important update to clarify some points to maintain transparency with all our stakeholders. Recently, Quant Mutual Fund has received inquiries from Sebi, and we want to address any concerns you may have regarding this matter.\" \"We want to assure you that Quant Mutual Fund is a regulated entity, and we are always fully committed to cooperate with the regulator throughout any review. We will provide all necessary support and continue to furnish data to Sebi on a regular and as-needed basis,\" Quant added. \"Quant mutual fund has emerged as one of the fastest growing in the country and best-performing fund houses in most of the schemes. Our primary goal remains unchanged: to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns to all our valued investors. Your confidence in Quant Mutual Fund is of utmost importance to us, and we are dedicated to maintaining transparency and adherence to regulatory standards,\" the statement added. Sebi has not officially commented on the matter. Quant Mutual Fund has rapidly grown to become one of India’s top-performing fund houses, managing assets worth nearly Rs 1 lakh crore across several schemes. The small-cap scheme alone, with assets of Rs 21,243 crore, has returned 68% over the past year. Following the development, small and midcap stocks on Dalal Street fell sharply. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said, \"Sebi investigation in the Quant Mutual Fund is a slight sentiment negative for the market.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Gautam Adani on Monday said that the Hindenburg incident was designed and orchestrated to defame Adani Enterprises while speaking at its 32nd AGM (annual general meeting). \"It was designed to defame us. It was a two-sided attack, a vague criticism on our financial standing,\" said Adani on the report issued by the US short seller about the conglomerate last year. He further said that the Adani group not only survived the aftermath of the Hindenburg incident but also came out stronger, demonstrating that no obstacle could weaken it. \"Perseverance never more evident than what we demonstrated last year. Adani Group fought back against attacks on integrity, and reputation by foreign short sellers. Proved no challenge can weaken the foundations of the Adani Group,\" said Adani. Hindenburg, in a report, accused the Adani group of manipulating stock prices and improperly using tax havens, leading to a sell-off in Gautam Adani's ports-to-power conglomerate. He also said that over the past year, the Adani Group faced a dual challenge of misinformation and political accusations, strategically timed to coincide with a crucial follow-on public offer (FPO). Gautam Adani highlighted that the Adani Group continued to prioritise the trust and interests of its investors. During an investigation into the allegations, the Group refunded investors the Rs 20,000 crore raised through the FPO. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court gave a clean chit to the Adani Group and dismissed all allegations while reposing confidence in SEBI's powers. The Supreme Court ruled that petitioners could not provide enough material to transfer the Adani-Hindenburg probe to a special investigation team. The court disposed of the petitions, finding that the \"threshold for a transfer of investigation\" had not been made out."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Investment platform Groww recently faced social media backlash after a user alleged that the company debited money from his account without making an investment. The user claimed that the Groww app failed to invest his money into a mutual fund scheme and generated a false folio number. The issue came to light when the user’s sister attempted to redeem the supposed investment. Although the original social media post has since been deleted, screenshots have been widely shared on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) . In response to the controversy, Groww admitted to the error, explaining that the customer’s dashboard incorrectly displayed a folio. The company clarified that no actual transaction had occurred and no money was deducted from the user’s account. To reassure the customer, Groww credited the claimed amount back to his account as a gesture of good faith . They have also asked the user to provide his bank statement to verify any debit related to the alleged investment. In an official statement on X, Groww assured users that no transaction took place and that the money was not deducted. They expressed regret for the error and confirmed that the reporting issue has been resolved. The company is in ongoing communication with the affected user to provide any additional support he might need. \"We assure everyone that no transaction took place and the customer's money was not deducted from the customer's bank account in the said matter,\" the statement read. \"To ensure that the investor doesn’t get anxious about the claimed amount, we have credited it to the investor on a good faith basis.\" The incident has irked several users on social media, with many expressing concern about their mutual fund investments through the platform. “This is concerning. I have monthly SIP on autopilot using Groww for years and I have never checked if whatever folio I'm allotted is actually there or not I'm going to maintain a sheet from now on. Groww make it easier for people to trust u with their hard earned money,” said one user. Some securities traders and advisors also highlighted the potential risks associated with newer investment platforms. \"While newer platforms can offer innovative solutions and competitive pricing, the potential risks associated with less established brokers should be carefully considered. Investors should always conduct thorough research, considering factors such as regulatory status, user reviews, financial health, and the overall reputation of the broker, before making a decision,\" the advisor said."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Quant Mutual Fund has issued a clarification after a media report suggested that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is investigating it over alleged front-running activities . The company has assured investors of its commitment to cooperation and transparency. “As a policy, we don’t comment on media reports. However, here is an important update to clarify some points to maintain transparency with all our stakeholders. Recently, Quant Mutual Fund has received inquiries from Sebi, and we want to address any concerns you may have regarding this matter,” the statement read. Quant highlighted its status as a regulated entity and pledged full cooperation with the regulator. “We want to assure you that Quant Mutual Fund is a regulated entity, and we are always fully committed to cooperating with the regulator throughout any review. We will provide all necessary support and continue to furnish data to Sebi on a regular and as-needed basis,” it added. The company highlighted its rapid growth and strong performance, managing assets worth nearly Rs 1 lakh crore across several schemes. The small-cap scheme alone, with assets of Rs 21,243 crore, has returned 68% over the past year. The Sebi investigation into Quant Mutual Fund involves allegations of front-running, an illegal practice where trades are made based on privileged information before larger clients execute those trades, reported The Economic Times. Sebi's probe includes search and seizure operations at Quant’s head office in Mumbai and at the addresses of suspected beneficiaries in Hyderabad. Alerts from Sebi’s surveillance system indicated that transactions of certain entities closely matched those of Quant Mutual Fund, raising suspicions of information leakage. A source close to the investigation mentioned, “Sebi's surveillance system threw up alerts that transactions of the suspected entities are matching with Quant Mutual Fund's transactions. How does it match?” Sebi suspects that a dealer from Quant or a broking firm handling the fund’s orders might have leaked trade information. During the search operations, Sebi seized digital devices, including mobile phones and computers, to gather evidence. Based on initial findings, Sebi plans to question individuals with access to Quant’s trade information, focusing on executives who knew the size and timing of orders. The investigation has impacted market sentiment, causing small and midcap stocks on Dalal Street to fall sharply. Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, commented, “Sebi investigation in the Quant Mutual Fund is a slight sentiment negative for the market.”"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is reportedly investigating Quant Mutual Fund (MF) over alleged front-running activities. According to media reports, the markets regulator conducted search and seizure operations at locations in Mumbai and Hyderabad, questioning Quant dealers and others connected to the case. Here's an explainer on what is happening at Quant Mutual Fund, one of India’s fastest-growing asset managers. But first, let’s understand what exactly is front-running. Front-running occurs when a mutual fund manager or trader executes orders on a security for their own account before executing orders for their clients. This gives the trader an unfair advantage, allowing them to profit from the expected movement in the security’s price, resulting from the larger client orders that follow. Front-running is considered highly unethical and illegal because it exploits confidential information and undermines market integrity. It breaches the trust and fiduciary duty that fund managers owe to their clients. Regulatory bodies like Sebi enforce strict rules to prevent such practices and ensure fair and transparent markets. Amit Goel, Co-Founder & Chief Global Strategist, Pace 360, said, \"Front-running essentially involves buying stocks before the fund itself does, driving the price up. This means the fund buys at a higher price, potentially impacting returns for investors.\" \"Front-running erodes investor trust in the fund house, which can lead to redemptions, affecting the fund's Net Asset Value (NAV). The investigation itself can create uncertainty, causing investors to hold off on further investments or even redeem existing ones until the situation is resolved,\" Goel added. For ordinary investors, front-running can lead to several negative outcomes: Higher costs: Investors might end up paying more for securities due to artificial price movements caused by front-running. Less favourable prices: The advantage held by front-runners often results in worse trade execution prices for regular investors. Erosion of confidence: When such practices come to light, it shakes investor confidence in the fairness and integrity of the financial markets. However, Goel says that in most cases, investor money in mutual funds is held securely. \"Even if the fund house is penalized, investor money is typically not directly at risk. The Sebi is the regulator, and their primary focus is protecting investor interests,\" he added. Quant Mutual Fund has acknowledged receiving inquiries from Sebi . It said, \"We will provide all necessary support and continue to furnish data to Sebi on a regular and as-needed basis.\" The fund house, which has grown rapidly from managing Rs 100 crore in 2019 to over Rs 93,000 crore currently, is now under scrutiny for its internal practices. Sebi’s reported action against Quant Mutual Fund highlights its commitment to maintaining market fairness. However, this is not the first time SEBI has taken such actions; in 2022, a similar investigation into Axis Mutual Fund for front-running resulted in 21 entities being barred from accessing capital markets. The investigation's findings could impact some smaller stocks held by the fund, such as RBL Bank Ltd., Aarti Pharmalabs Ltd., and Ador Welding Ltd. If Quant Mutual Fund or any of its individuals are found guilty of front-running, they could face severe penalties, including fines, suspension, and possible legal action."

The write-off is attributed to \"the significant decrease in value for equity investors.\" Byju's, once India's most promising startup valued at $22 billion in 2022, has seen its valuation nearly wiped out due to financial, legal, and operational challenges. Earlier this year, a group of shareholders, including Prosus, called for the removal of Byju's founders and leadership change, expressing concerns about the company's future stability. Prosus reported a fair value loss of $493 million in other comprehensive income for the year in its annual report. In November, Prosus had slashed Byju's valuation to below $3 billion , marking an 86% drop from its peak valuation of $22 billion, amid governance and cash-flow issues faced by the company"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The government has set limits on the amount of wheat that traders can stockpile, and it might reduce or remove the import tax on wheat to help keep prices down, a senior government official announced on Monday. Wheat prices in India, the world's second-largest wheat producer, have been increasing recently due to supply concerns. \"Setting stock limits was just one measure. We have several other methods to ensure that wheat prices do not spike unreasonably,\" said Sanjeev Chopra, secretary, Department of Food and Public Distribution. The secretary also confirmed that there is no shortage of wheat. Wheat prices have risen by 5.5-6% over the past year. In August, consumer inflation for cereals was notably high at 8.7% compared to the same period last year. As of April, wheat stocks in state warehouses came down to 7.5 million metric tons, the lowest level in 16 years. The government had to sell a record 10 million tons to flour millers and biscuit makers to control rising prices. At the beginning of April 2023, government warehouses held 8.2 million metric tons of wheat. Retailers and others are required to submit price reports weekly through the portal managed by the Department of Food and Public Distribution (DFPD). \"They have been allotted a 30-day period to comply with the updated limits, which mirror those established last year,\" he said. The limits specify 3,000 tonnes for wholesalers, 10 tonnes for individual retailers, and 10 tonnes per outlet, with a maximum of 3,000 tonnes for large chains. India had imposed a ban on wheat exports in 2022, and according to Chopra, there are no plans to lift this restriction. Similarly, there are no proposals to ease export restrictions on sugar and rice. India holds the title of the world's largest rice exporter and is the second-largest producer of sugar."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Oh daddy ji de cash utte, kari jawe aish Sadda baapu zimidaar, kitho le ke deve car These lines are from the song 'Bapu Zimidar' by Punjabi singer Jassie Gill. The song, like most other Punjabi music numbers, has colourful picturisation along with peppy beats and a theme, which again, is not uncommon -- a poor boy vying for the attention of a rich girl. But the song also has references to the social hierarchy in agrarian Punjab. The boy, who is the son of a farmer, sings about how he could hardly afford a scooter while his dream girl, who is the daughter of a rich middleman, buys a luxury car which costs her nothing but a meal. 'Bapu Zimidar' shows the sharp divide between the peasantry and the wealthy middlemen in Punjab, the agrarian capital of India. Incidentally, these rich landlords and middlemen, called arhtiyas, were at the forefront of the farmers' protests in 2020-21 and now again this year. This begs a question -- how did the farmers' protests, traditionally seen as peasants' uprisings, become a monopoly of the middle and rich farmers in India, especially in the northern region? And whether and how the Green Revolution of the 1960s was responsible for this. Here's the history of it. The pre-Independence farmers' movements in India were peasant-driven as a response to the exploitative colonial policies. Farmers were subjected to a high tax regime and blatant exploitation, which often resulted in underpayment for their produce and loss of rights over their land. The agrarian community mobilised in large numbers across the country to voice their grievances and demand change. These agitations became a nursery of political movements and gave rise to Indian nationalism. One of the earliest examples of such a movement was the Champaran Satyagraha of 1917, where tenant farmers in Bihar's Champaran district protested against the oppressive policies of the British that forced them to grow indigo, a cash crop that benefited the colonial traders but left the farmers impoverished. Mahatma Gandhi in Champaran in 1917. (Photo: Wikimedia Commons) This movement marked Mahatma Gandhi's first major active involvement in Indian politics and became a significant milestone in the national struggle for freedom. Kheda Satyagraha of 1918, Bardoli Satyagraha of 1925, and Tebhaga movement of 1946-1947 were some other notable farmers' agitations. In 1936, All India Kisan Sabha, the farmers' wing of the Communist Party of India, was established to fight for their rights. After Independence, several regional farmers' panels also cropped up. Among the most important ones were the Shetkari Sanghathana in Maharashtra, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) in Uttar Pradesh and in Punjab, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh in Gujarat, Tamil Nadu Agriculturalists’ Association (Tamilaga Vyavasavavigal Sangham or TVS), and the Karnataka State Farmers’ Association (Karnataka Rajya Ryota Sangha or KRRS). The might of these organisations were on display during the 1959 protests in Punjab against the Anti-Betterment Levy system. This movement was a response to the Punjab government's imposition of a betterment levy, which was intended to cover the expenses of the newly constructed Bhakra canal system. The levy placed a heavy financial burden on the farmers, who were already grappling with increased taxation, rising indebtedness, and growing unemployment due to evictions from land. The Communist Party and the Kisan Sabha were at the forefront of opposing the legislation from its inception. They argued that the imposition of this tax would leave the peasantry with little to invest in agriculture and could force the poorer sections to sell their lands. Despite their opposition, the government promulgated an ordinance in January 1959 to collect the betterment levy as an advance payment, which ignited the protests. The anti-betterment levy struggle started on January 21, 1959, in four districts, and rapidly spread to many other affected districts. The struggle concluded on March 22, 1959, with the government's surrender to the movement's demands. The Indian agricultural landscape saw a significant shift in the 1960s after the government introduced Green Revolution technology to make the country self-sustainable. At that time, India was struggling to sustain its large population and was dependent on the US for food aid. The reason -- India's farming sector was unable to keep pace with the growing population and needed a technological push. For this, the government subsidised rates of seeds, fertilisers, electricity and other necessary farming commodities. It also established the Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme in 1960 and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in 1965. These mechanisms aimed to balance the interests of farmers and workers by ensuring that farmers received a price that covered their costs and provided a reasonable income, while workers had access to food at reasonable prices. A farmer sprinkles fertiliser on the crops in fields. (Photo: PTI) Institutions such as the National Agricultural Research System and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research provided technical support for the use of these new technologies, which required abundant water and agrochemicals. State support extended to credit access, input subsidies, market infrastructure, and maintaining remunerative prices for outputs. The nationalisation of banks in 1969 was a landmark economic policy decision influenced by the need to provide credit support for agricultural expansion. This move brought a significant portion of the banking business under public control and directed the newly public banks to lend at least 18 per cent of their credit to agriculture, thus providing a boost to investment in the sector. However, the success of these policies was limited by their narrow objectives, which favoured states with assured irrigation and led to more agricultural credit being allocated to these regions. The MSP and grain procurement through the FCI were predominantly limited to areas like Punjab, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh, where rice and wheat became the most commonly purchased commodities. Despite these advancements, the plight of small and marginal farmers remained challenging. Rich farmers accessed the majority of government bank credit, leaving smaller farmers to seek loans from moneylenders at exploitative interest rates, often resulting in debt traps. While the Green Revolution enhanced agricultural productivity, farmers believed that it failed to ensure them agricultural profitability, especially in an increasingly evolving landscape. In his journal 'Farmers' agitation, civil society and the state', Staffan Lindberg writes that farmers held that the terms of trade between industry and agriculture were increasingly developing in favour of industry and against agriculture. \"Caught in an escalating cost-price spiral in which many farmers seem to suffer losses, they demand lower prices for inputs like seeds, fertilisers and pesticides, lower tariffs on electricity and water, lower taxes, and debt relief,\" Lindberg notes. But while the farmers were highlighting the rural-urban gap, the voices of the agricultural labourers were getting subdued. Due to the inclusion of new technology in agriculture, the requirement for farm labourers decreased significantly. In his paper 'Whither the Indian village: Culture and agriculture in Rural India', Dipankar Gupta writes that \"except for certain pockets in Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, the concerns of the agricultural worker do not get political expression anywhere else\". \"The increasing incidence of family farms made hired labour less critical for agricultural production than before. Where there was substantial agricultural prosperity in the years following the Green Revolution, such as Punjab and Haryana, labour could be hired from among migrants who came from east India in search of employment,\" notes Gupta. Gupta further notes in his research that this led to the diminution of the agricultural labourer's presence in rural India. \"By the time the 1980s came around, agricultural labourer movements that involved huge rural unions and supra-local organiser became more or less a thing of the past. Now was the turn of Mahendra Singh Tikait and Nanjudaswamy to lead agitation espousing the interests of owner cultivators,\" notes Gupta. Among their common demands were lower prices on inputs like seeds, fertilisers, and pesticides, lower tariffs on electricity and water, abolition of land revenue, and introduction of crop insurance.

(PTI Photo) After the farmers launched a massive strike in 1981 across the country raising these demands, RK Hazari, former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said, \"This conflict is an inevitable cost of progress. The positive function of conflict and competition is to disturb the old equilibrium and help bring about a new equilibrium. Meanwhile, one gets disequilibrium, even disorder\". In these protests, while the landless labourers participated, their demands did not form the core of the agitation. These movements also had a significant impact on the political landscape. For instance, some Congress leaders who opposed institutional reform in agriculture formed the Swatantra Party in 1959. Chaudhary Charan Singh, a former Congress leader, founded the Bharatiya Kranti Dal (BKD), which focused on the interests of owner-cultivators and criticised the urban industrial model of national development as being antithetical to the interests of the rural population. He led significant farmer agitations in the 1970s and later went on to become the Prime Minister of India. Mahendra Singh Tikait, former president of Bharatiya Kisan Union, famously led a massive rally at Delhi's Boat Club lawns in 1988. This rally saw an impressive turnout of nearly five lakh farmers from Uttar Pradesh, who gathered to demand higher prices for sugarcane and waiving electricity and water charges. The protest was so impactful that it led the Rajiv Gandhi government to concede to a 35-point charter of demands put forth by the farmers. According to political analysts, there were \"strong indications\" that the farmers' movements played an important role in the overthrow of the Rajiv Gandhi government in 1989. In 2024, farmers are back on the streets to put pressure on the government to fulfil their long-standing demands. Last time when the farmers, again from the rich farming states of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, staged a sit-in protest near the borders of Delhi, it lasted for over a year and forced the Narendra Modi government to repeal the three farm reform laws. Farmers confront the police at the Shambhu border between Punjab and Haryana, February 14, 2024. (Photo: Reuters) There are some few additions to their demands this time. The farmers have been demanding a legal guarantee of a Minimum Support Price (MSP) across all crops, implementing Swaminathan Commission's recommendations, debt relief, pensions for farmers, and withdrawing cases against past protestors. Again, these farmers are from the three power blocks of agriculture in North India. And the demands of the landless labourers are still not on their block."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story It was March 28, 1982. Indira Gandhi, then Prime Minister of India, returned from London to her Delhi residence, where she was determined to set the house in order, especially her younger daughter-in-law, Maneka. Indira Gandhi was furious over Maneka after the young widow of Sanjay Gandhi attended the Lucknow convention organised by Akbar Ahmed, her late husband's confidante. Maneka's appearance at the event was to project her into active politics, which irked her powerful mother-in-law, who was already grooming her elder son Rajiv to fill in the void left behind by Sanjay Gandhi. The fight was over Amethi, a Nehru-Gandhi bastion and Sanjay Gandhi's constituency. After his death on June 23, 1980, Amethi went for bypolls in 1981, and it was his elder brother, Rajiv, who won. This did not go well with Maneka Gandhi, who was harbouring the ambitions of taking the place of her husband in the Nehru-Gandhi leadership succession. Thus followed an ugly, public family break-up which made national headlines. There was no doubt in the Congress ranks that Sanjay Gandhi was the chosen political successor to Indira Gandhi. Unlike Rajiv Gandhi, who was away from politics and happy with his flying career with Indian Airlines, Sanjay Gandhi was considered the right-hand man of his mother in political affairs. However, after his untimely death in an air accident, Indira Gandhi chose to bring her other son into politics, who reluctantly obeyed her command. Maneka Gandhi, who was nearly 25 years old at the time, was unlike her sister-in-law Sonia, who was docile and to the liking of her mother-in-law. On the other hand, Maneka Gandhi, formerly Maneka Anand, was a feisty character, who was seen with her husband many times during his active political campaigns in the 1970s. Maneka Gandhi (R) with Sanjay Gandhi. (Photo: India Today) In his book '24 Akbar Road: A Short History of The People Behind The Fall And Rise of The Congress', political commentator Rasheed Kidwai notes that after Rajiv Gandhi filed nominations for the Amethi bypoll in 1981, Maneka Gandhi \"tried hard to edge him out\". Kidwai mentions Mohammed Yunus, a former diplomat who was close to the Gandhis, said that since Maneka was not even 25 at that time, the minimum age to contest polls in India, \"she wanted Indira Gandhi to amend the Constitution to let her in but the Prime Minister refused\". This decision was perceived by Maneka as an attempt to usurp her late husband's political legacy, leading to an irreparable rift between her and Indira. The situation escalated dramatically on the night of March 28, 1982, marking a pivotal moment in their relationship. In his book 'The Red Sari', Spanish writer Javier Moro writes that on the fateful day, in front of mediapersons and police personnel, Maneka Gandhi left the Prime Minister's 1, Safdarjung Road residence in Delhi along with her son Varun, who was almost two years old then. Moro notes that Indira Gandhi was miffed with Maneka for attending the Lucknow convention without her approval. Maneka's appearance at the Lucknow convention was not just a mere act of presence; it was a calculated move, a year-and-a-half in the making, aimed at asserting her political credibility and challenging the established order. The convention, organised by Akbar Ahmed against the expressed wishes of Indira Gandhi , was seen as a direct affront to the Prime Minister. It was a gathering that dared to support Sanjay Gandhi's five-point programme, an initiative closely associated with Maneka's late husband, thereby positioning itself in opposition to the current party leadership. The crowd, numbering between 8,000 to 10,000, was a mix of khadi-clad volunteers, many armed, symbolising a readiness for confrontation or at least resistance. Maneka's speech, though largely inaudible amidst the chaos, was not the centrepiece; her audacity to show up was the statement. This act of defiance did not go unnoticed. The convention was quickly labelled as an \"anti-party activity\" by several top Congress leaders, including Sanjay Singh, the Uttar Pradesh Youth Congress (I) president, and Jagdish Tytler, the Delhi MP and chief of the Delhi Youth Congress (I). On the morning of March 28, 1982, Indira Gandhi came home \"determined to be obeyed\". Maneka's greeting was met with a curt “We’ll talk later” from Indira, notes Moro. Maneka locked herself in her room till a servant came to her bearing a tray with her food on it. Upon being asked about why he brought it to the room, the man answered, \"Mrs Gandhi (Indira) asks me to tell you that she does not wish you to join the rest of the family for lunch,\" the servant said. \"Maneka’s legs were shaking as she went down the corridor. The moment of truth had come, but there was no one in the sitting room. She had to wait a few minutes, which seemed to go on forever, and during which she started biting her nails again, like when she was a little girl. Suddenly she heard noises and Indira appeared, furious and walking barefoot, accompanied by the guru, Dhirendra Brahmachari, and secretary Dhawan, with the fancy hairstyle. She wanted them as witnesses,\" wrote Javier Moro. Moro writes that Indira Gandhi pointed her finger at Maneka and shouted, “Get out of this house immediately!\" Moro continues, “I told you not to speak in Lucknow, but you did exactly what you wanted and you disobeyed me! There was poison in every single one of your words. Do you think I can’t see that? Get out of here! Leave this house right now!” she screamed. “Go back to your mother’s house!\" Moro notes that Maneka Gandhi called her sister Ambika about the incident and called her there. While the sisters packed Maneka's belongings, Indira burst into the room: \"Get out now! I’ve told you not to take anything with you.\" Ambika intervened: \"She won’t go! This is her home!\" \"This is not her home,\" shouted Indira, with her eyes bulging in fury. \"This is the home of the Prime Minister of India!\" Maneka Gandhi leaving the 1, Safdarjung bungalow with Varun Gandhi. According to Moro, \"It was after eleven o’clock when, carrying the confused, half-asleep Firoz Varun in her arms, Maneka finally left the house and got into a car with her sister. An explosion of flashes lit up the whole sequence of their departure. Photos that fitted the image she wanted to give, of a loyal daughter-in-law treated cruelly by her powerful and authoritarian mother-in-law. Maneka waving to the reporters from the car,' said the caption under the photo that came out the next morning in all the newspapers in India and some abroad.\" After leaving her mother-in-law's home, Maneka Gandhi made her political ambitions clear. A year after Rajiv Gandhi's bypoll victory in Amethi, Maneka Gandhi visited the constituency, declaring it her \"rightful political home\" and resolving to fight her brother-in-law tooth and nail. She founded the Rashtriya Sanjay Manch along with Akbar Ahmed, and fought the general elections from Amethi against Rajiv Gandhi in 1984. During her campaign trail, Maneka Gandhi's major plank was to \"expose this degenerate Congress culture\". \"Whether the Congress Party pours in money or not, the point is that everyone is sick to death of the Congress and its ways,\" a June 15, 1984 India Today Magazine report quoted Maneka Gandhi as saying. Before the elections, the Rajiv Gandhi camp thought it would not be a cakewalk for him to defeat Maneka, who was actively working on the ground. Amethi's population largely consisted of women voters, and thus Rajiv Gandhi asked his wife Sonia to campaign with him in the constituency. And she left no stone unturned to support her husband. Sonia Gandhi (L) with Rajiv Gandhi. (Photo: India Today) According to a December 1984 article in India Today Magazine , Sonia camped solidly in Amethi while Rajiv Gandhi was on his nationwide tour. \"When he arrived to campaign there she also emerged, head covered demurely in a handloom sari, wearing red bindi and red bangles. Although she made no speeches, she chaffed party workers in chaste Hindi, was accessible to volunteers and independently met women voters,\" the report said. But things changed dramatically after October 31, 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguard. This led to Rajiv Gandhi becoming the interim Prime Minister, and he now had the public sentiment too going into the December elections. Maneka, however, did not get bogged down by this. She was now facing not an MP, but a Prime Minister. She made it her campaign pitch, saying that as the prime minister in charge of running the country, Rajiv Gandhi wouldn't have any time to spare for Amethi. \"Remember Mrs Gandhi? When she was widowed, she went to the people of her husband's constituency in Rae Bareli. They voted for her and Rae Bareli saw great progress. But once she became prime minister, Rae Bareli began to go downhill. It will be the same here. So I say, Rajiv ji you look after the rest of the country but you leave Amethi to Menaka's care,\" the India Today Magazine report quoted Maneka Gandhi as saying in one of her Amethi rallies. However, the tide was in favour of Rajiv Gandhi as he led the Congress to a landslide victory, winning 404 seats out of 514. In Amethi, he defeated Maneka Gandhi by over 3.14 lakh votes. Maneka Gandhi lost her deposit, and then never contested from Amethi again. Amethi continued to be the stronghold of the Congress even after Rajiv Gandhi's assassination in 1991. After his death, Gandhi family loyalist Satish Sharma was elected twice from the seat in 1991 and 1996. Sonia Gandhi made her electoral debut in 1999 from Amethi. In 2004, Sonia Gandhi left Amethi for her son Rahul and moved to Raebareli, another Congress bastion. Rahul Gandhi represented Amethi for 15 years till 2019 when he was defeated by BJP's Smriti Irani. Now, the Congress has got the Amethi seat as part of the seat-sharing pact with the Samajwadi Party for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Rahul Gandhi, who is currently a Member of Parliament from Wayanad in Kerala, is likely to return to Amethi in a bid to wrest back the family stronghold from the ruling BJP. As for Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun, they are the BJP MPs from Sultanpur and Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh, respectively. Last year, there were reports that Varun Gandhi, who has been vocal about the BJP-led NDA government's policies, would leave the party and may join the Samajwadi Party, which may give him a ticket from his father's constituency, Amethi . However, Varun Gandhi continues to be in the BJP, while the Congress continues to convince Rahul Gandhi to return to Amethi."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Recently, a DMK minister embarrassed his party's government in Tamil Nadu by printing an advertisement in local newspapers featuring a rocket with the five-star red flag of China. The advertisement, issued by Fisheries Minister Anitha Radhakrishnan, was to celebrate the foundation stone laying of the Isro spaceport in Kulasekarapattinam. The ad, which featured pictures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister MK Stalin, also inadvertently showcased a computer-generated rocket emblazoned with the Chinese national flag . Tamil Nadu BJP president K Annamalai criticised the DMK government, calling it a \"manifestation of DMK's commitment to China\". Annamalai also recounted an incident from 60 years ago when Tamil Nadu's initial bid to host Isro's first spaceport was marred by the \"inefficiency\" of a minister, who also happened to be from the DMK. Fisheries Minister Anitha Radhakrishnan (L) with Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin. (Photo: Facebook) Annamalai was referring to an incident from the late 1960s, when Vikram Sarabhai, the father of India's space programme, was looking for a site for a spaceport to launch Isro's satellites. In his autobiography 'Ready to fire: How India and I survived the Isro spy case', scientist Nambi Narayanan mentions how Sriharikota became the choice for Isro's spaceport. Narayanan writes that Sriharikota was not even Isro's first choice for launchpads. According to him, senior Isro scientist RM Vasagam had identified two sites for the spaceport, both in Tamil Nadu. \"For launching polar satellites, it was clear to us, our launch pad has to be on the eastern coast. Launching the rocket along the spin of the earth, it gave a huge advantage of cost; also by manoeuvring the rocket to the south after its initial eastward journey, we avoid flying over any landmass,\" Narayanan writes. \"The coastline of Kanyakumari was considered in the late 1960s, but a terrible mishandling by the government of Tamil Nadu, and a timely pitch by Andhra Pradesh, made Sriharikota happen,\" he added. According to Nambi Narayanan, then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister CN Annadurai was to participate in a discussion with Vikram Sarabhai and a few scientists to identify a site from a shortlist proposed by Vikram Sarabhai. However, Annadurai could not attend the meeting due to severe shoulder pain. In his place, he sent one of his ministers, Mathiyazhagan, to attend the meeting. According to Nambi Narayanan, Mathiyazhagan kept Sarabhai waiting, and when he eventually arrived for the meeting, he was not in his senses. \"Sarabhai was kept waiting, and after sometime, the minister was ‘brought’ to the meeting — with a few holding him from falling. The politician irritated Sarabhai no end with his impossible demands and incoherence. Much before the meeting got over, Sarabhai had decided Tamil Nadu is not the place to be,\" Nambi Narayanan mentions in his book. Around the same time, Andhra Pradesh made an offer to Isro which, according to Nambi Narayanan, it \"could not refuse\". \"Take the 26,000-acre Sriharikota island, he (Andhra Pradesh Governor) told Sarabhai,\" writes Nambi Narayanan. Narayanan writes how the Andhra Pradesh government realised that with India’s rocket launchpad coming up, the sparsely inhabited Sriharikota might see some development. \"Today, a rocket lifting off, spewing fire and smoke reflected on the Pulicat Lake, where migratory flamingoes come to roost is quite a sight,\" he writes. Thus, the Sriharikota Range (SHAR) was established in the coastal town in Andhra Pradesh on October 1, 1971. It was renamed Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) in September 2005 in honour of Satish Dhawan, who was a prominent Indian aerospace engineer and the Chairman of the Isro from 1972 to 1984. Even as Tamil Nadu prepares to host India's second spaceport at Kulasekarapattinam , the state government's advertisement fiasco brought back memories from 60 years ago when it lost the opportunity to host the country's first spaceport because of a DMK minister."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story “After I was nominated at the Oscars in 1979. I excitedly told my father about it. He was happy and hugged me,\" veteran filmmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra recollected. \"How much money will you get,\" asked Vidhu Vinod Chopra's father. Chopra's heart sank. It was just an award, without any monetary benefits. Also, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, who would go on to belt out superhits like the recent '12th Fail', didn't have any money to go to the US to attend the Academy Awards ceremony. But, money wasn't his only concern. Neither did he have a passport nor a tuxedo to attend the event. The ace filmmaker in this dire situation turned to Lal Krishna Advani for help. That was when the BJP leader, then the Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting, helped Chopra out. Vidhu Vinod Chopra's documentary short from 1978, 'An Encounter with Faces', which captured the lives of children living in orphanages, was nominated for the Oscars. That was a time when most documentaries were made with government support and didn't get the kind of traction as they do today. On Sunday (March 10), an India-based documentary, 'To Kill A Tiger', will be vying for the Oscars. It has been nominated in the Best Documentary Feature Film category. The film delves into a gang-rape case in Jharkhand, showing the challenges faced by the victim and her family in the fight for justice. 'To Kill a Tiger', backed by Priyanka Chopra and Dev Patel , is part of a recent trend. At the 2022 Academy Awards, it was documentaries from India like 'The Elephant Whisperers' and 'All That Breathes' that made the headlines. The Academy Awards has two categories for documentaries -- feature and shorts. While Kartiki Gonsalves' 'The Elephant Whisperers' won the award for Best Documentary Short Film at the 95th Academy Awards, Shaunak Sen's 'All That Breathes', a tale of brothers Saud and Nadeem from Delhi, was nominated in the Best Documentary Feature category. 'Writing with Fire', a 2021 Indian documentary film directed by Sushmit Ghosh and Rintu Thomas was the first Indian documentary feature film to be nominated for the Academy Awards. Vidhu Vinod Chopra's 'An Encounter with Faces' was the first documentary short from India to be nominated for the Oscars way back in 1979. The rise of documentary film-making is also a reflection of our times and the craving for real-life stories and dramas. Recent decades have seen \"documentaries emergence from the shadows of feature films\", film historian Avijit Ghosh tells IndiaToday.In. \"Documentary film-makers have established themselves independently. Screening documentaries in theatres is still not easy. But platforms to show them, like OTT, YouTube, Vimeo, have come up,\" says Ghosh. \"The Indian documentaries have created a far bigger buzz than feature films on the global film festival circuit,\" added the author of 'When Ardh Satya Met Himmatwala'. Really, documentary film-making has come a long way since Vidhu Vinod Chopra's 'An Encounter with Faces' and his tryst with the Oscars. Nominated for India's first Oscars in documentary shorts, Vidhu Vinod Chopra was struggling for money to travel to the US for the event. That is when LK Advani's timely intervention helped Chopra in 1979. Chopra, who had graduated from Pune's Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), made his first documentary film in 1976, 'Murder at Monkey Hill'. It was his second documentary film that got him into the Oscars reckoning. This was much before the filmmaker directed acclaimed films like 'Parinda' and '1942: A Love Story'. This was also the time when \"the Indian government's Film Division made and produced documentaries and newsreels on a massive scale\", according to Film historian Avijit Ghosh. \"In the early decades of Independent India, most films and documentaries were made by in-house people.\" Vidhu Vinod Chopra was a pathbreaker in that way. “When I was nominated for the Oscar, I didn’t have a ticket, a passport or a visa, so, I couldn’t go for it,\" Vidhu Vinod Chopra said in an interaction with The Lallantop. \"I went to Delhi to meet LK Advani ji. He gave me an Air India ticket to the US, and got me a $20 per day allowance,\" he said. LK Advani, who was then the Information and Broadcasting Minister, helped Chopra get \"a passport in just a couple of days for six months without police verification”. But, after securing the passport and the daily expenses with the help of LK Advani, Chopra faced the visa hurdle. \"He couldn’t get me a visa,\" added Chopra, recounting his 1979 Academy Awards tryst. As a result, how the 27-year-old Vidhu Vinod Chopra went on to get a US visa stamp on his passport is another interesting tale. Chopra, after returning from Delhi, seeking an American visa, went to the Mumbai Consulate on a Saturday. Naturally, the security guard did not let him in. \"I was shouting... 'Monday, there is the Oscars,\" Chopra recalled. That's when he caught the attention of a kind American consulate employee whom Chopra told about his nomination. \"Can you prove it?\" the man asked him. Vidhu Vinod Chopra had to prove his Oscar nomination with newspaper clippings. That helped. The \"American gentleman\", despite it being Sunday, granted him a single-entry visa, allowing Chopra to attend the Oscars ceremony. With the Air India ticket and daily allowance that LK Advani helped him with, now Chopra was all set for the event. However, another irritant remained. Vidhu Vinod Chopra, whose recent film '12th Fail' recently created a buzz and was lauded for the beautiful portrayal of the struggle and the chase for excellence, didn’t have money to buy a tuxedo for the Academy Awards ceremony. “I didn’t have money to buy a suit. They suggested I rent a tuxedo, but I didn’t have money for that either. So, they said wear your national dress,\" Vidhu Vinod Chopra told The Lallantop \"I was sitting at the Oscars in a white, khadi kurta-pyjama,” Chopra added. Chopra didn't get to kiss the Oscar statue, but went on to give people unforgettable movies like 'Parinda', '1942: A Love Story', 'Parineeta' and '3 Idiots'. Although Vidhu Vinod Chopra did not make a documentary film again, he gained phenomenal success in commercial cinema and trained other remarkable Indian filmmakers like Rajkumar Hirani and Sanjay Leela Bhansali in the coming years. Amid the anticipation and celebrations of Indian documentaries excelling on the global stage and Indian stories increasingly finding their voices, it's essential to note the struggles and the stories of perseverance that paved the way for today's successes. And Vidhu Vinod Chopra's 1979 rendezvous with the Oscars is one."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A British Captain once described Bengaluru as \"The Land of a Thousand Lakes\". The officer was tasked by Governor General Cornwallis to find an alternative route between Madras and Seringapatam (Srirangapatna). He made the \"discovery\" of Bengaluru while travelling. It was the late 18th century, the initial days of the British East India Company in the subcontinent. Centuries later, a retired bureaucrat, V Balasubramanian, in his 2013 paper titled, 'Death of lakes and future of Bangalore', concluded that Bengaluru's tanks and lakes stored \"sewage wastewater\". The majority of the 'thousand lakes' are nowhere to be seen in the urbanised Karnataka city of today. Of the 'thousand lakes', Bengaluru, as of now, has around 400 in its metropolitan region, according to a Deccan Herald report. However, Biome International's 2016 study said the lakes numbered just 200. Moreover, Bengaluru has just 17 \"good lakes\", says the Lakes Department website of the city's civic body, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). It is quite ironic that the growth of the city killed the lakes because the city developed due to the water bodies. Janaki Nair, in her book 'The Promise of the Metropolis: Bangalore's Twentieth Century' , credited the building and conservation of 'lakes and tanks' for the evolution of Bangalore as a metropolis. Bengaluru, once a city of a 'thousand lakes', is now staring at a hot and hard summer as the retreating monsoons failed to bring sufficient rainfall to south and interior Karnataka. The 'Silicon Valley of India' is facing acute water shortages on the back of a once-in-decades drought. It was the thousand cascading lakes that helped Bengaluru meet its water demands. The self-sustaining localised lakes were mostly man-made, stored rainwater to be used for domestic and agricultural needs during harsh summer months. The man to be credited with the cascading lakes of Bengaluru was Kempe Gowda, the 16th-century founder of the city. Bengaluru's international airport and bus terminal are named after its founder, Kempe Gowda. PM Modi inaugurated the ‘Statue of Prosperity’, dedicated to Kempe Gowda in Bengaluru and \"remembered him as a visionary put the welfare of people above everything else\". (Image: X/NarendraModi) Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the \"role of Sri Nadaprabhu Kempegowda in the making of Bengaluru\", calling it \"unparalleled\", when he inaugurated the ‘Statue of Prosperity’ in Bengaluru in 2022. The lakes of Bengaluru weren't ornamental, they served a purpose. But why did the city in Karnataka need the lakes? The answer lies in the geography and topography of Bengaluru. Bengaluru is located at an elevation of around 900 metres (3,000 feet) from the sea level and doesn't have a major river flowing in its proximity. Historically, scarce rainfall and the slopes of its terrain prompted the kings and kingdoms that ruled the region to construct lakes and freshwater tanks here. Bengaluru's four smaller rivers -- Hebbal, Vrushabhavathi, Koramangala and Challaghatta -- and their streams which flow outwards were not enough to meet the water needs of the city and the adjoining towns. Bengaluru's topographic map, where the colours denote the elevation of various parts of the city. (Image: Topographic-map.com) “For a site that was not close to a water source and was situated on an elevated ridge, a reliable supply of water for agricultural or domestic purposes was imperative from the earliest days of the settlement... No wonder then that the provision of water through a system of tanks became a crucial element of city building throughout the twentieth century,\" noted Janaki Nair, in her book 'The Promise of the Metropolis: Bangalore's Twentieth Century'. Some locals say that Bengaluru was once referred to as ' Kalyananagara ', a city of kalyanis or tanks, which further solidifies the importance of lakes and tanks in Bengaluru. The earliest recorded mention of the lakes of Bengaluru refers to renovation work in the 8th Century AD. It was built during the reign of the Western Ganga dynasty. If the lake was renovated in the 8th Century, it would have been built much earlier. The Bellandur Lake, one of Bengaluru's largest lakes, was also constructed during the rule of the Western Ganga Dynasty. The Cholas, the Hoysalas and the Vijayanagara dynasties continued constructing lakes and tanks. These water bodies helped harvest rainwater from the catchment areas in the rainy months, and in turn, fed the area with water when it was hot and dry. Archaeological evidence from Bengaluru's Agara Lake highlights how important maintaining lakes and canals in the city was. “The Irvvuliyur odeya, Irugamayya’s son Sirimayya, fixed sluices (gates of canals) to the two tanks, had the eastern tank built, and obtained the bittuvatta (land grant) of the three tanks,” said an unearthed inscription at the Agara Lake in Bengaluru's Southeast. The lakes, often near human settlements, locally called Kattes and Kuntes , were maintained and run by the local community, mostly with the royal patronage of chiefs and kings. Specific families and groups were responsible for maintenance tasks such as desilting, and maintenance of canals and tanks, while the communities enjoyed their access to fishing, irrigation, grazing, and collection of fodder, according to Francis Buchanan's book, A journey from Madras through the countries of Mysore, Canara, and Malabar. The lakes of Bengaluru became 'the cascading lakes of Bengaluru' by the 16th century, when Kempe Gowda I (reign 1513-1569), the Vijayanagar governor, carried out massive infrastructure projects in Bengaluru and adjoining areas, under his able patronage. Kempe Gowda, the man who rose up the ranks after conquering village after village in South Karnataka, founded 16th century Bengaluru. \"Kempe Gowda was a master builder. Whether his under-taking was a temple, tank, for or a town, in its execution he always exhibited the zeal of a pioneer,\" noted M Fazlul Hasan in his 1970 book, Banglore through the centuries. Kempe Gowda's mother's advice led him to \"emphasise the importance of constructing lakes and cultivating trees\", according to media reports. To enhance the finances of his new kingdom, Kempe Gowda brought vast areas of land under cultivation by constructing tanks, digging wells and cutting canals across arable lands, according to Fazlul Hasan's book. Kempegowda is credited for overseeing the construction of the renowned Dharmambudi Hebbal and Kempambudi lakes, alongside the Sampangi lake. While Kempambudi was built in honour of Kempamma, Gowda's family deity, the Sampangi Lake was to meet the water needs of the fortified city that Kempe Gowda had just built. Gowda laid the foundation of a network of tanks and irrigation wells in his reign of 46 years. To turn the lakes into cascading lakes, Kempe Gowda ingeniously interlinked the lakes, ensuring no drop of water was wasted. The collected rainwater from a lake located at a higher elevation would flow into one at a lower elevation through 'rajakaluwes' (canals). The process would be repeated in one lake after another. Water from one lake would trickle down to the one at a lower elevation, until the lake at the lowest elevation would discharge into the natural drainage valleys of Challaghatta, Koramangala, Hebbal and Vrishabhavati, according to V Balasubramanian's paper on Bengaluru Lakes. The series of lakes, interlinked to each other harvested rainwater, recharged groundwater, supported agriculture, and gave livelihoods to generations in the region, otherwise much tougher to sustain. The lakes were the lifelines of Bengaluru, which gave the city its favourable pleasant climate. The upkeep of the lakes of Bengaluru went on even during the rule of the Vijayanagara dynasty. The Mysore Sultans, then the Wodeyars, and finally the British, all realised the role of the lakes in Bengaluru's existence. \"The British did not draw legitimacy for their rule from the patronage of Brahmins and temples, but the supply of water to the old and new cities was as important as in earlier times,\" said a 2011 committee report submitted to the Karnataka High Court. The Ulsoor tank, Miller's Tank and Hesarghatta Lake are fine examples of reservoirs Bengaluru got in the 19th century, noted V Balasubramanian. Ulsoor Lake as seen in the cover photo shows it as a hub of agriculture and related activities, but the health of the lake has deteriorated multifold in the last few decades. Things, however, went downhill for waterbodies like these, with Bengaluru's rapid urbanisation and exponential population growth. The sprint to the 'Silicon Valley of India'-tag fuelled unchecked encroachments and pollution of the lakes. Unplanned and unscientific human settlements choked these vital water arteries of Bengaluru. The change in land use in Bengaluru between 1973 and 2020. (Image: Comptroller and Auditor General of India report) \"Encroachment and pollution of water bodies, the felling of thousands of trees, conversion of open areas and parks into commercial, industrial, and residential settlements were also the by-products of Bengaluru's economic growth, according to a 2013 journal by H S Sudhira and Harini Nagendra. As the rapid urbanisation and exponential population growth in Bengaluru is a reality, the vanishing of lakes is a reality too. So is the fact that the water situation in Bengaluru would have been better, had the city not neglected its 'thousand lakes'."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story It was the night of December 27, 1970, radios at homes crackled and Indira Gandhi, then the Prime Minister, began her address to the nation. What Indira Gandhi was going to announce on that cold winter night would freeze the election process for decades, until the nation once again attempted to revert to the earlier process of simultaneous polls. “In the present situation, we cannot go ahead with our proclaimed programme and keep our pledges to our people,” Indira Gandhi said. The Prime Minister then declared that the Lok Sabha was being dissolved, a full 15 months before the end of its term. That was the first time that the Lok Sabha was dissolved in Independent India. “We are concerned not merely with remaining in power but with using that power to ensure a better life for the vast majority of our people,” Indira said in her broadcast. Ousted from the Congress, Indira Gandhi was leading a minority government cobbled together with the support of several regional parties, including the DMK, and would have been the PM till February 1972. But she didn't just want to be in power. She wanted to be firmly in power. Indira's decision to dissolve the Lok Sabha and call for the general election 15 months ahead of schedule would result in decoupling the parliamentary election from the state polls. Till then, the parliamentary and the Assembly polls were held simultaneously in India. The current government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after five decades, revived the idea of holding polls simultaneously in India. Boasting the perks of reduction in governance distractions, moral code of conduct impact, poll expenditure and horse-trading, the government is considering a 'One Nation One Election'. A high-level committee led by former President Ram Nath Kovind recommended amending the Constitution and the election-related laws for simultaneous polls for the Lok Sabha, all the state assemblies and local bodies, starting in 2029. The Congress, Indira's own party, has criticised the Modi government's simultaneous poll move. But what exactly led to Indira Gandhi advancing the general election by 15 months, and what was it like when elections were held simultaneously? Had Indira Gandhi not recommended the dissolution of the Lok Sabha in 1970 and called for an early general election, the elections for Lok Sabha would have taken place in 1972 along with polls for state assemblies. If one would rewind to the initial days of the republic, India conducted its first elections in the winter of 1951-1952. The election of 1951-1952 was in fact a fine specimen of 'one nation, one election' , even if it was not a conscious choice of the founding fathers. It was the first election, and it had to be conducted together for both tiers of government. Understandably so, the first election was co-conducted for the Lok Sabha and all the state legislatures simultaneously, after the Constitution of India came into effect in January 1950. However, it must be noted that local body polls were not part of the 1951–1952 polls. The simultaneous polls which commenced in 1951-1952, as a result, went on for around two decades to come. The batches of Lok Sabhas and Vidhan Sabhas would commence and end their five-year terms together until Prime Minister Indira Gandhi tinkered with the harmonious polls in 1970. The harmonious poll cycle disrupted by Indira Gandhi was, however, a result of many complex factors and circumstances. The backdrop to the development was a period of considerable turmoil and transition within the Indian National Congress in the 1960s. The late 1960s, after the deaths of Jawaharlal Nehru and Lal Bahadur Shashtri, was an era of fragmentation for the Grand Old Party. After the mysterious death of Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri in Tashkent in January 1966, Indira Gandhi was sworn in as the prime minister , with the support of the 'Syndicate', which otherwise wasn't amenable to her. However, she was not the first choice of the party leadership, dominated by the unofficial group within the Congress party. The powerful 'Syndicate' consisted of K Kamraj, Atulya Ghosh, Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, S Nijalingappa, SK Patil and Biju Patnaik, among others. Indira Gandhi got the top job, whereas Morarji Desai, who also eyed the Prime Minister's chair, had to settle to be her deputy. Even outside the Congress fold, Indira Gandhi's credentials had not been tested yet, apart from her short stint in the Shashtri Cabinet as the Information and Broadcasting Minister. Indira Gandhi was even dubbed a goongi gudiya (the dumb doll) by socialist stalwart Ram Manohar Lohia after she appeared too nervous to read out a Budget speech. Gandhi was aware that she did not enjoy a lot of liking from her party people, particularly the 'Syndicate'. Hence, she started to consolidate her position among the masses. An assertive Indira, therefore, had jumped into the central ring, contrary to what K Kamaraj held her to be, \"a pliable, weak lump of clay they could mould and remould\", writes Tariq Ali in his book, 'The Nehrus and The Gandhis' . She gave it all in the 1967 Lok Sabha election and campaigned extensively with her slogan, \"garibi hatao\". Her stance on bank privatisation and privy purse did not go well with the 'Syndicate' and Morarji Desai. With brewing opposition in the party, she was expelled from the Congress in November 1969 for \"violating party discipline\". \"The Syndicate had never forgiven her (Indira Gandhi) for the independent stand she had taken on vital issues relating to the country,\" noted Pupul Jayakar in 'Indira Gandhi A Biography' . Indira's response to her expulsion saw her float a new party called the Indian National Congress (Requisitionists), against the Indian National Congress (Organisation), led by K Kamaraj and later Morarji Desai. Subsequently, Indira Gandhi's Indian National Congress (Requisitionists), formed a minority government with the help of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and left parties to stay in power. She was acutely aware of the instability. On Indira's advice, President VV Giri dissolved the Lok Sabha. \"Indira’s government after the split was vulnerable, and she was advised by [her secretary] PN Haksar to call a midterm election in 1971 to get popular endorsement of her policies,\" noted Inder Malhotra in 'Indira Gandhi: A Personal and Political Biography' . The decline in the Congress in the 1967 polls, a period of drought, rising prices, two wars with Pakistan, growing corruption, the decision to devalue the rupee, and the successive deaths of two Prime Ministers came together for Indira Gandhi to call the polls a year prior in 1971, according to political scientist Myron Weiner. The decision was fraught with risks, but Indira Gandhi's gamble paid off. Indira's Congress faction eventually went on to amass around 43% of the votes, translating to 352 seats (out of 518 seats) in the lower house, while the Indian National Congress (Organisation) could manage just 16 seats. \"By the margin of its victory, Congress (R) would require no qualifying suffix,\" noted historian Ramachandra Guha, saying, \"Indira's Congress came to be known as the real Congress.\" The premature dissolution of the Lok Sabha by Indira Gandhi, therefore, prompted a premature election in March 1971, which else would have taken place in 1972. This marked the first instance in India's 23 years of independence where Parliament had been dissolved prior to completing its full term. By advancing the elections, Indira Gandhi effectively decoupled the national election cycle from that of the state assemblies, whose terms were yet to conclude. Though Indira Gandhi's decision to call the general election early was a big factor in breaking the simultaneous poll cycle, there were some states that had already moved to a separate poll calendar. As early as July 1959, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru advised President Rajendra Prasad to dismiss the government of Kerala, led by E M S Namboodiripad, the 'first elected Communist government in the world'. The dissolution of the Kerala government cited its incapacity to rule based on the constitutional mandates, which historian V Krishna Ananth, called \"a significant abuse of Article 356 of the Constitution.\" As unstable state governments crumbled, Kerala, Haryana, Bihar, Nagaland, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal were compelled to hold midterm elections throughout the 1960s. Indira Gandhi, according to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, \"misused\" Article 356 of the Constitution on 50 occasions to dissolve elected governments. So, it was unstable Congress governments that fell off the simultaneous election calendar and the separation of the parliamentary election from the state polls was ensured by Indira Gandhi with her decision in 1970, which she broadcast on a cold December night in 1970."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story \"Sarkar to gayi. Hum haar rahe hain (The government is going. We are losing),\" Atal Bihari Vajpayee told his aide Shiv Kumar Pareek in 2004. It was midnight and the BJP leader and then Prime Minister had just returned from an election campaign in Lucknow. His aide refused to believe his ears. With all the confidence in the BJP and the 'India Shining' campaign, even the Opposition believed the BJP was returning to power. Internal polls had also suggested a victory for the BJP-led the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). \"In which world are you living in? I am campaigning among people,\" said former Prime Minister Vajpayee, next. Vajpayee's personal secretary for the longest time, Shiv Kumar Pareek, narrated the incident to a news agency in 2018. With the optimistic campaign and slogan of 'India Shining', the BJP was going in for an early poll, eight months before the 13th Lok Sabha was to end its term later that year. An early poll in the summer months of April and May, that Prime Minister Vajpayee wasn't in favour of, made the Lok Sabha election a summer affair. Lok Sabha elections in India used to be held typically in colder months, favourable for voters to sit in the open for rallies and then queue up for voting. Though the schedule went off the plan in 1991 because of midterm polls, it was the election of 2004 and stable governments after that which made the general election a summer exercise. The exercise of democracy amid a heatwave in many parts of India prompted the Election Commission to issue advisories for both poll officials and the public . It has done so this year too. The decision to hold the Lok Sabha elections months ahead of schedule was taken by an overconfident BJP. Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani and BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu, thought it was the right time to show how strong their party and its allies were . The BJP also had a good feeling after it won the assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The party thought Prime Minister Vajpayee was very popular lately, especially after his decision to hold a new round of talks with Pakistan's Pervez Musharraf. A 7% growth, with the Indian economy growing, reaping the perks of the LPG reforms in the early 1990s, was seen as another factor for BJPs surge in confidence. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister of India, found himself in a precarious position. The party agreed with the request for early polls at a two-day meeting in Hyderabad, and so did Vajpayee. \"There were two reasons behind the (2004) defeat. First, the slogan of 'India Shining' went against us. The second was the decision to hold early polls. Although Atalji was not in favour of early polls, the party decided to hold it,\" Shiv Kumar Pareek, who stood by Atal Bihari Vajpayee for over five decades, said in the 2018 interview. “Elections were due in, say, September. Now they are advancing them to an earlier date shows that they are afraid, that by September, they will not be in a position to have the support of the people,” Subhash Khasyap, an analyst with the New Delhi-based think-tank, the Center for Policy Research, said. Despite his initial reluctance, circumstances compelled Vajpayee to advance the elections. An underlying worry loomed large, prompting Vajpayee to take the plunge earlier than anticipated. President APJ. Abdul Kalam, following the recommendation by the Vajpayee Cabinet, signed the proclamation of dissolution on February 6, after Atal Bihari Vajpayee met Kalam twice in the preceding week. As the summer approached, the country prepared both politically and for the rising temperatures. The 2004 Lok Sabha election was held in three phases in just 20 days. India was ready, so were the 5,435 candidates, six national parties and the 36 state parties. Almost four million civilians, police and security forces were deployed and lakhs of polling booths were set up. Beneath the grand claim of progress, India Shining, discontent simmered among sections of the electorate, particularly in rural India. The summer heat and lack of electricity and water made matters worse. \"It is 40 degrees Celsius and you hardly have electricity or water, you are living in subsistence farming, are you really feeling good, really Shining'?\" asked a Samajwadi Partyu candidate, campaigning near Kanpur,\" noted Ruchir Sharma, in his book, Democracy on the Road. \"The crowd laughed, giving us a first inkling that the BJP message might be missing its mark,\" Ruchir Sharma wrote. The relentless summer sun beat down, so did the political heat on the BJP and its poll pitch in 2024. \"Where is India Shining?\", asked then Congress president Sonia Gandhi at a Delhi slum. The Congress had rejected the 'India Shining', calling it a mere \"eyewash\". When the results were declared, the BJP had slumped to 138 seats from 182 in 1999. The Congress had bettered its tally from 114 in 1999 and emerged as the single largest party with 145 seats. \"...the way urban elites had overlooked the depth of alienation in the heartland. We should have understood that voters who are struggling to subsist can't eat impressive-sounding numbers like '8 per cent GDP growth'. While many of us had come back sceptical about 'India Shining', none of us had the courage to defy the consensus and call an outright BJP defeat,\" wrote Ruchir Sharma in his book Democracy on the road, summing up the India Shining and BJP defeat. Traditionally, Lok Sabha elections in India have been held during the cooler months, primarily between February and April. The advancing of the polls in 2004 and the full term enjoyed by the governments changed it. As a result, the last three Lok Sabha elections after 2004 were held between April and May in 2009, 2014 and 2019. Election Commission data over the years 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019 show that there is a decline in voter turnout in the later phases of the polls as polling enters the harsh summer month of May. The voter turnout in 2019 fell from 69.50% in the first phase, which was held in early April, to 64.85% in the final phase on May 19. Likewise, the 2009 and 2014 elections also saw a minute dip as the poll phases entered the scourge of the heartland. In 2024, the seventh and last phase of the Lok Sabha election will be held on June 1. This year, polls will push through May and end up in June. The seven-phrased polls will commence on April 19. The whopping 44 days will cover the 543 Lok Sabha seats, the state assemblies of Sikkim, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh, and bye-elections on 35 seats. The Election Commission on March 26 issued an advisory to the Chief Electoral Officers of all states and Union Territories to prepare for the heatwaves expected during the polling season. It has a set of 'dos and don'ts'. Other than the test of conducting and participating in the largest democratic exercise in the world, the election machinery, the voters and the political parties all face the heat test too."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Over three thousand years ago, the Sun suddenly dimmed and disappeared in the middle of the day, in a part of the world that is modern-day Syria. The darkness gave rise to the worst of fears. It was seen as a signal of an impending doom for the ancient kingdom. The reaction in ancient Syria was similar to many other cultures where the disappearance of the Sun was seen as a bad omen. Centuries later, we came to know what happened on that day in ancient Syria from a clay tablet discovered in 1948. On April 8, 2024, parts of the United States will go dark during the day. The Sun will not set but will be cloaked by the Moon as it aligns in a straight line next to Earth in an intricate cosmic dance. For about 4 minutes and 28 seconds, places along a curved path on the continent of North America will experience a rare night during the daytime. The disappearance of the Sun that the ancient Syrians saw as a bad omen is now a well-understood cosmic phenomenon. The phenomenon is called the Total Solar Eclipse , and occurs approximately every 18 months somewhere on Earth, but isn't visible from all locations during each event. The last time it happened in the US was over seven years ago. Meanwhile, for India, a solar eclipse won't be visible till 2031. Evidence of eclipse observations has been found across many ancient cultures, from the Mesopotamians to the Egyptians, and across the Mayans. They viewed solar eclipses as omens or celestial events of great significance. But, a clay tablet unearthed in 1948 revealed how ancient societies feared the sudden disappearance of the Sun, and how it was associated with the downfall of an empire. The clay tablet was found amid the ruins of the Western Palace Archive of Ugarit, an ancient port city located on the northern Mediterranean coast, which today is Syria. Labelled KTU 1.78, the tablet was part of the final years of the city and is expected to have been written over 3,200 years ago between 1250 BCE and 1175 BCE. Analysis of the tablet by scholars revealed that it described a sudden dimming and disappearance of the Sun in the middle of the day. The darkness made \"its gatekeeper RÅáp,\" visible. RÅáp in ancient Ugarit meant Mars. The same way as the Total Solar Eclipse on April 8 will make four planets appear in the darkened skies . One of them will be Mars. The solar eclipse of 1223 BCE coincided with a turbulent period. (Photo: Getty) While the tablet does not mention a solar eclipse, as limited by the understanding of the time, the description points to it. However, what's more interesting is what was written on the back side of the clay tablet. The phrase inscribed on the backside read: “Two livers were examined: danger.\" Astronomers Teije de Jong and Wilfred van Soldt revealed the true meaning of the inscription years later, in 1989. In a paper published in the journal Nature , they noted that the anxiety stemming from the solar eclipse and the sudden appearance of Mars led to the practice of liver divination. Liver divination, also known as hepatomancy, is a form of divination or fortune-telling practised in various cultures throughout history. It involves the interpretation of the appearance and characteristics of animal livers, particularly those of sacrificial animals, to foretell future events or gain insights into matters of importance. Practitioners used to believe that these characteristics could reveal information about the gods' or spirits' intentions, the outcomes of battles or harvests, or the success of upcoming ventures. Study of eclipses has been crucial in advancing our understanding of astronomy. (Photo: Getty) The solar eclipse of 1223 BCE coincided with a turbulent period for Ugarit and its neighbouring kingdoms, which eventually fell. The clay tablet went on to become the oldest recorded evidence of a solar eclipse on the planet . Records of such observations have been found across civilisations. While Mesopotamians inscribed eclipse observations on clay tablets, Egyptians depicted them in temple carvings. Mayans incorporated eclipse predictions into their calendars and monuments. Native American civilisations like the Chacoans commemorated the total solar eclipse by carving it on rocks. Over the centuries, the study of eclipses has been crucial in advancing our understanding of astronomy and celestial mechanics. Historically, observations of eclipses helped early astronomers develop models of the solar system and predict future celestial events. On April 8, 2024, the eclipse will be studied and analysed once again, and records will be preserved for posterity, the same way as in ancient Syria."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story \"In practical politics, the Mahasabha knows that we must advance through reasonable compromises,\" Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the then president of the Hindu Mahasabha, said at the 24th session of the Hindu Mahasabha at Cawnpore (now Kanpur) in 1942. The remarks by Savarkar were regarding the coming together of the Hindu Mahasabha and Muhammad Ali Jinnah's Muslim League to form coalition governments in Sindh and North-West Frontier Province after the 1937 provincial elections. The alliance between the Hindu Mahasabha and the Muslim League, which was for a brief period, has returned to political discussions ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections , sparking a war of words between the Congress and the BJP. It all started after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, taking a swipe, said the Congress's manifesto \"completely bears the imprint of the Muslim League\" . Other BJP leaders also joined the PM in attacking the Congress over its \"politics of appeasement\". In a clap back, the Congress said BJP ideologue Syama Prasad Mookerjee, who was then part of the Hindu Mahasabha, \"formed governments in Bengal, Sindh, and the NWFP (North West Frontier Province) in the 1940s in coalition with the Muslim League\". The Congress's claims aren't completely true. A dive into the pages of history shows that while the Congress was right in saying that the Hindu Mahasabha and the Muslim League were in a coalition government in Sindh and NWFP, the story in Bengal was different. In Sindh and NWFP, the political coming together of the Mahasabha and Muslim League was marked by inherent contradictions and tensions as their long-term goals were at odds. Also, while the Hindu Mahasabha joined hands with the Muslim League for practical political reasons, it did not compromise its ideology. The collaboration of the unlikely allies started with the provincial elections in 1937, which coincided with Savarkar being elected as the president of the Hindu Mahasabha. However, both the Hindu Mahasabha and the Muslim League were decimated in the elections, with the Congress securing a landslide victory, winning 711 of the total 1,585 provincial assembly seats. The Congress also garnered an absolute majority in five of the 11 provinces -- Madras, Bihar, Orissa, Central, and United Provinces. On the other hand, the Muslim League even failed to form governments in Muslim-majority regions, winning just 106 seats. The League failed to win a single seat in Sindh and the NWFP. In Bengal, it could not win even one-third of the Muslim-reserved seats. The results gave a clear signal that the Muslim League had no mass support from the community as several Muslim-reserved seats went to Independents. However, two years later, the scenario changed. World War II broke out and the then viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, unilaterally declared India would go to war against Germany. The fact that the viceroy made the announcement without any consultation irked the Congress. In October 1939, the Congress proposed that it would support Britain's decision only if it committed to India's Independence after the war and recognised its right to frame its own Constitution. However, Linlithgow refused, and all Congress ministers resigned in protest. The incident opened up paths for the Hindu Mahasabha and the Muslim League to access political power. The two parties then went on to form an alliance in Sindh and NWFP -- both Muslim-majority provinces. However, differences between the parties, who were diametrically opposite ideologically, started cropping up in 1943 when the Sindh Assembly took up the Pakistan Resolution that recommended \"Muslims of India are a separate nation\". The resolution was eventually passed 24-3 in the Sindh Assembly as the Hindu Mahasabha members staged a walk out and three ministers in the government voted against it. At the same time, a massive churn was taking place in Bengal. In the 1937 elections in Bengal, a relatively lesser known Krishak Praja Party (KPP), which espoused the cause of the krishaks (peasants) and prajas (tenants), burst onto the political scene. Led by Fazlul Haq, the party, with its promise to abolish the zamindari system, swept the seats in the East Bengal region (modern day Bangladesh). As per 'Leaves from a Diary' by Syama Prasad Mookerjee, Fazlul Haq was keen to form a coalition with the Congress, but talks fell through. Haq then formed a coalition government with the Muslim League and some Independent members. However, the bonhomie between Haq and Jinnah was short-lived. In 1941, Haq decided to join the Viceroy's Defence Council during World War II despite opposition from Jinnah. The Muslim League withdrew from the ministry. However, Fazlul Haq found support from unlikely quarters and the Hindu Mahasabha, led by Syama Prasad Mookerjee, and the Forward Bloc of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose supported the Krishak Praja Party to save the government. The Hindu Mahasabha, which became popular among Calcutta's Marwari businessmen and wealthy caste-Hindu zamindars, started gaining popularity in Calcutta. So much so that the Progressive Coalition Ministry under Haq was popularly referred to as \"Syama-Haq ministry\". In his 'Leaves from a Diary', Mookerjee, who became the finance minister in the government, mentioned why he decided to join the Haq government. \"Left to himself, he (Haq) is one of the most lovable personalities. He indeed shines in the company he keeps -- a good batch of friends and followers may help him to do enormous good to his people and country, a bad lot may lead him to hell,\" Mookerjee wrote. In 1943, Mookerjee resigned from the Bengal Cabinet in protest against the interference of the Governor and the bureaucracy in ministerial affairs. He also blamed the Muslim League for the fall of the Haq government. \"The Muslim League for seven months carried on a relentless and vituperative campaign against the ministry and especially the Chief Minister, thus weakening the forces of law and order and rousing communal passions,\" he wrote in his diary. The Hindu Mahasabha had never partnered with the Muslim League in Bengal, like the Congress is suggesting, and on the contrary, it blamed the Muslim organisation for the fall of the government in the eastern province. After resigning, Mookerjee took the reins of the Hindu Mahasabha from Savarkar in 1943 and served its president till 1946. During this period, he took up the cause of Bengal Hindus in the run-up to Partition. However, two years later, he resigned from the Mahasabha amid differences with other leaders over his suggestion that it should stay away from politics and remain a cultural outfit. In 1951, Mookerjee, with the help of RSS volunteers, went on to form the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the predecessor of the BJP. So, the Hindu Mahasabha had indeed partnered with the Muslim League in Sindh and NWFP, both Muslim-majority provinces, but never in Bengal, like the Congress has now suggested. Also, the Hindu Mahasabha never compromised its ideology and the walk out in the Sindh Assembly during the tabling of the 'Pakistan Resolution' is clear proof of that."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In the spring of 1987, Syed Mohammed Yusuf Shah, better known now as Syed Salahuddin was a candidate in the 1987 assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir. That was the last time Syed Salahuddin participated in an electoral process before crossing the Line of Control and heading the terror outfit Hizb-ul-Mujahideen. Syed Salahuddin was contesting for Amira Kadal, a seat in the heart of Srinagar, as a Muslim United Front (MUF) candidate. The MUF was an alliance of several Islamist parties of the Valley. The crucial 1987 assembly polls were a referendum of sorts, for the Congress and the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) alliance and the Islamists under the banner of MUF. The turnout was massive. As the counting progressed, it became apparent that the conservative Syed Salahuddin was way ahead of his opponent, Ghulam Mohiuddin Shah of the National Conference. With Salahuddin's leading margin becoming bigger, Mohiuddin Shah left the counting centre disappointed. However, he was soon summoned back to the polling station, only to be declared the winner of the Amira Kadal assembly seat. Once trailing by a huge margin, Mohiuddin Shah was declared the winner by 4,289 votes. All hell broke loose as supporters of the Muslim United Front (MUF) and Salahuddin clashed with security personnel, alleging manipulation of the counting process. Parts of the Kashmir valley -- Anantnag, Sopore, Handwara and Baramulla -- were under a virtual curfew and the victorious Farooq Abdullah government was busy arresting top MUF leaders, which in turn gave credence to the allegations of rigging and electoral manipulations. Syded Salahuddin, along with his campaign manager, Yasin Malik, and other supporters were thrown behind bars without any charges. The election in the spring of 1987 was Syed Salahuddin's last attempt at India's electoral politics, before he took up arms with the aim of merging Jammu and Kashmir with Pakistan. He vowed to flood the Kashmir Valley with terror and obstruct any peace negotiations. His poll manager, Yasin Malik, crossed over to Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (POK) and went on to lead the Muzaffarabad-based terror outfit Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), which unleashed terror on Indian forces and the Kashmiri Pandits in the Valley. The 1987 polls and the outcomes changed the course of Jammu and Kashmir's history, and even after decades they still loom large over Kashmir and its political discourse. The 1987 election returned to contemporary politics after Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Conference (JKPC) leader Sajad Lone hit out at National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah and others over the rigged polls. \"A big step towards building confidence among Kashmiris would be by initiating an FIR against National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah, Congress leaders and bureaucrats for the manipulation which led to turbulence and bloodshed in Kashmir for the next three decades,\" Sajad Lone said. Earlier too, Sajad Lone had linked militancy and terrorism in Kashmir to the rigged polls of 1987. \"It was said that guns came here because of Article 370. The reality is that the gun did not come because of Article 370, it came in 1987 after the rigged elections, while Article 370 was there from 1950 onwards,\" Lone said, addressing a press conference in Srinagar. The rigged polls were one of the factors, the others being those promoted by Pakistan and its spy agency ISI to hurt India's interests. Sajad Lone's reference to the 1987 election comes amid talks of polls in Jammu and Kashmir being held soon. Speaking at an election rally in Udhampur in Jammu region, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about restoring J&K's statehood and conducting assembly polls soon. \"... The time is not far when Assembly Elections will be held in Jammu and Kashmir. Jammu and Kashmir will get the status of statehood. You will be able to share your dreams with your MLA and your ministers...,\" said PM Modi last week. He further added that the upcoming Lok Sabha polls will take place without the fear of terrorism, strikes, stone-pelting and cross-border firing. The 1987 elections were mired in controversy from the outset. Jammu and Kashmir Governor, Jagmohan, dismissed the Ghulam Mohammad Shah-led Awami National Conference government in 1986, igniting anger in the Valley. Jagmohan's action was seen as undermining Kashmir's Muslim-majority identity. The accord between Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah, an attempt to reconcile with him, sparked outrage. The coalition failed to quell mounting sentiments against it. As the polls approached, a wide array of Islamic fundamentalists came under the Muslim United Front umbrella for the elections, which was referred to as a watershed moment by Kashmir-based scholar Mehraj Hajini in his 2002 piece, 'Democracy of Denial in Kashmir'. The Kashmiri electorate in the Valley saw the polls as an opportunity to channel their anger against 40 years of \"family rule (of the Abdullahs)\", corruption, and lack of economic development in the state. The government was scarcely aware of the rising resentment until the smouldering embers burst into flames, according to Tavleen Singh's book, Kashmir: A Tragedy of Errors. It wasn't just Amira Kadal, the seat from which Syed Salahuddin was contesting, where the mandate was allegedly manipulated. An Amira Kadal-like situation was reported from several seats in the Kashmir Valley as well as in Jammu. News reports were full of eyewitnesses speaking of a pattern of \"rigging and strong-arm tactics all over the Valley,\" of \"massive booth-capturing by gangs\", of \"entire ballot-boxes pre-stamped in favour of the NC\", of numerous people \"simply not being allowed to vote\", and of government supervisors \"stopping the counting as soon as they saw opposition candidates taking a lead\", noted Sumantra Bose in his book, Kashmir, Roots of Conflict, Path to Peace. The vote counting was postponed in several MUF strongholds at the last minute. As the counting started in Handwara, the MUF candidate and his counting agents found themselves thrown out of the counting station by the police, according to an India Today magazine report of 1987. People's Conference (PC) candidate Abdul Ghani Lone complained to the Election Commissioner that ballot-boxes from a counting station in Handwara were removed overnight and 100 of his counting agents were arrested. \"This simply deepens people's feelings against the Government of India. If people are not allowed to cast their votes, where will their venom go except into expressions of anti-national feelings?,\" asked a disconsolate Abdul Ghani Lone, father of Sajad Lone. Reports of electoral rigging poured into several offices of District Commissioners from various parts of the Valley. Reports of electoral manipulation and coercive methods continued to inundate party headquarters and district commissioners' offices in various parts of the Valley. In Pattan, entire ballot books pre-stamped for the National Conference (bearing serial numbers 024864-024898) were recovered with counterfoils intact from polling booths, according to an India Today magazine report by Inderjit Bhadwar. Similar pre-stamped books were found by MUF agents from polling officers at Idgah, Handwara and Cahdura, according to the report. MUF candidates also alleged booth-capturing at Khan Sahib and Hazratbal where gangs of National Conference (NC) workers drove to polling stations in Matador vans and entered the booths while the police looked helplessly on, reported the India Today in March 1987. In several counting stations, the counting process was stopped when MUF candidates took the lead over Congress-NC candidates. In many instances, polling officers refused to seal ballot-boxes. However, the government machinery turned a blind eye to the allegations and complaints, and, instead, started its crackdown on opposition leaders. As a result, the polls were swept by the alliance of Farooq Abdullah's Jammu and Kashmir National Conference and Congress, led by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. While the Congress won all 26 seats it contested, the NC was declared winner in 40 of the 46 seats it contested. The Congress-JKNC combine winning 66 seats in the 76-member Assembly could have been a big deal. But it was not, for obvious reasons. However, the true scale of \"rigging\" is not known till date. A 2022 report submitted to the US Congress says \"...the belief that Rajiv Gandhi’s government had left the Kashmiri Muslim population in 1987 electorally disenfranchised\" was one of the factors behind the conflict in Kashmir. The blatant poll manipulations of 1987 were among the several factors, including those fanned by Pakistan and its spy agency ISI, that led to widespread anger in Jammu and Kashmir and resulted in the rise of militancy and terrorism in the Valley by 1989."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Cometh elections in India, cometh big promises of eradicating poverty through swift measures. While most poll promises do not see the desired implementation, their pitch and emphasis by political parties suggest the country's economic drift. The Indian economy thrived after the 1991 LPG (Liberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation) reforms, but the country's economy was in a shambles till the 1980s due to the socialist tendencies of the government. In 1970, the Indira Gandhi-led government increased the direct tax rate to as high as 93.5%, which went on to become 97.5% in 1973-74. The government's move, mirroring the global trends which villainised wealth creation. Indira Gandhi saw taxation as a \"major instrument to achieve greater equality of incomes and wealth\". Her policy to tax a small pool of people heavily, instead of widening the tax net, didn't work. Large-scale tax evasion forced the policy to be withdrawn within years. In 1949-50, then Finance Minister John Mathai tinkered with the tax rates for the first time. He reduced tax on incomes up to Rs 10,000 by a quarter of an anna, from one anna to nine pies in the first slab, and from two annas to \"one nine pies\" in the second slab. An anna was a currency unit formerly used in India, which was equal to 1/16 of a rupee. It was divided into 4 paisa or 12 pies, thus there were 64 paise in a rupee and 192 pies. After this, India adopted a progressive tax regime, and personal income tax rates were extraordinarily high during the decades of 1950-80. While the maximum income tax rate (including the surcharge) in the 1950s was 25 per cent, it shot up exponentially to 88 per cent in the 1960s. On February 28, 1970, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who also held the finance portfolio, read her Budget speech in Parliament. The theme of social welfare was central to the Budget and a number of provisions were made for the agriculture sector, which was in the thick of Indira Gandhi's policies following the Green Revolution. To fund these social welfare programmes, the government required major funding from the exchequer. With Indira Gandhi being a strong opponent of foreign direct investment (FDI), the taxpayer had to bear the brunt of her socialist ambitions. \"Taxation is also a major instrument in all-modern societies to achieve greater equality of incomes and wealth. It is, therefore, proposed to make our direct tax system serve this purpose by increasing income taxation at the higher levels as well as by substantially enhancing the present rates of taxation on wealth and gifts,\" said the Prime Minister in her speech. In her speech, Indira Gandhi announced an income tax rate of 10% on income between Rs 5,000- Rs 10,000, which progressively went up to 85% for income above Rs 2,00,000. With the addition of the surcharge at 10%, an astonishing 93.5% tax rate was applicable on those with income above Rs 2,00,000. In simpler terms, this meant that for every Rs 100 earned by a person above Rs 200,000, he/she could get just Rs 6.50. Moreover, the personal income tax had 11 tax brackets in 1970-71. In their paper 'Trends and Issues in Tax Policy and Reform in India', M Govinda Rao and R Kavita Rao note that \"the increase in income tax rates to confiscatory levels was completed immediately after the split in the Congress party in 1969 and appeared to be a part of the effort to give the party a pro-Left image\". The progressive taxation did not stop there. Even as India emerged victorious in the war of 1971 with Pakistan, the war strained the economy further. \"Fiscal instruments must be deployed to discourage payment of high salaries and remunerations which go ill with the norms of an egalitarian society,\" said former Finance Minister YB Chavan in his 1971 Union Budget speech. In the Budget of 1973-74, YB Chavan proposed an increase in the surcharge to 15%, taking the highest tax rate applicable to an individual to an astronomical 97.50%. A report by the Direct Taxes Enquiry Committee in 1971 attributed large-scale tax evasion, among other reasons, as a result of the exorbitant tax rates. \"Prevalence of high tax rates is the first and foremost reason for tax evasion because this is what makes the evasion so profitable and attractive in spite of the attendant risk,\" the committee report stated, recommending a reduction in the marginal tax rate to 75%. This change was implemented in 1974-75, when the marginal rate was brought down to 77%, including a 10% surcharge. In 1976-77, the marginal rate was further reduced to 66%. A major simplification and rationalisation initiative came in 1985-86, when the number of tax brackets were reduced from eight to four and the highest marginal rate was brought down to 50%. The last wave of reform in personal income taxation was initiated based on the recommendation of the Tax Reform Committee, 1991. The tax rates were considerably simplified to have only three tax brackets of 20, 30 and 40% in 1992-93. Further reductions came in 1997-98, when the three rates were brought down to 10, 20 and 30%. Prior to the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, the Congress has made promises to make people lakhpati without offering a real road map for funding such policies. Unlike the 1970s, India may not be allergic to FDIs, but the discussion around reintroducing inheritance tax and wealth tax and the idea of wealth redistribution surely reminds of the socialist times. These are the times of widening the tax net, not overtaxing the small percentage of people who diligently pay their taxes. Otherwise, the policy will backfire, as it did during the time of Indira Gandhi."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story It was August 1976, and a letter undersigned by Pakistan's Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto reached New Delhi. The letter was addressed to the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi. After talking about a few things about bilateral cooperation between India and Pakistan, the letter from Rawalpindi promptly jumped to a specific demand. \"I am writing to you about the treasure which is being unearthed in Jaipur under your Government’s orders... I would urge you to remain cognisant of Pakistan's claim to its due share of this wealth...,\" read Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's letter to Indira Gandhi. Pakistan's Prime Minister, Bhutto, laid claim to Pakistan's share in the treasure that was being searched for in Jaipur's Jaigarh Fort on Indira Gandhi's orders. We are reminded of the treasure hunt of 1976 under Indira Gandhi because of the talk of gold and mangalsutra in this Lok Sabha election. If Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleged that the Congress planned to snatch mangalsutras, Priyanka Gandhi said her mother had given away her mangalsutra for the nation . However, it is also true that Priyanka's grandmother Indira Gandhi had ordered the massive treasure hunt at Jaipur's Jaigarh Fort in 1976 after detaining Rajmata Gayatri Devi. The treasure hunt was so loud that it reached Bhutto in Pakistan, and he thought of laying the Islamic Republic's claim on a treasure that he never knew of. The treasure hunt was so colossal that it went on for five months in the Jaigarh Fort. The Army, the Income Tax Department, the Archaeological Survey of India and the local police were all engaged. Just as Indira Gandhi had her sights set on the gold at Jaigarh Fort, Zulfikar Bhutto pursued the buried treasure too. However, the treasure hunt which unfolded during the dark days of Emergency in 1976, actually had its origins at least a few hundred years ago during the reign of Mughal Emperor Akbar. In the year, 1581, Akbar sent his commander-in-chief Raja Man Singh I of Jaipur to the northwest frontier to crush rebel kingdoms and chieftains, and tasked him with bringing parts of modern day Afghanistan under Mughal rule. During this campaign, Raja Man Singh got hold of an unimaginable treasure trove of gold in Afghanistan and brought it back to India and hid it in the 16th century Amber Fort. \"Raja Man Singh I, one of the greatest generals in the mediaeval history of India, is said to have brought a huge amount of wealth from his Kabul expedition (1581-1587).\" wrote RS Khangarot and PS Nathawat in their 1990 book, Jaigarh, The Invincible Fort of Amber. They say that \"the wealth was stored in no other fort than the Jaigarh\", which came up later, in 1726. Despite his loyalty to Akbar, it is believed that Man Singh didn't tell the Mughal emperor about the gold haul that he brought back from the Kabul expedition. Years passed, and the treasure is believed to have remained hidden within the walls of the Amber Fort and in secret, until it was documented in an Arabian book. The first mention of the treasure came up in a book titled 'Haft Tilismat-e-Amberi' (Seven magical treasuries of Amber) which said that the wealth in the treasuries were located in a place called 'sagar' (water tanks), behind the Amber fort. Years on, during British rule, the colonial explorers also got hold of the book and grew curious. They tried to locate the treasure, but in vain. Thre treasure hidden by Raja Man Singh, pursued by the British, was the very same treasure that Indira Gandhi went after. The hunt commenced at the peak of the Emergency, which Indira Gandhi imposed on 25 June 1975. Civil liberties were suspended, the press was heavily censored, and political opponents like Jayaprakash Narayan, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai were put behind bars. Thousands of her critics languished in jails across India. One of them was Gayatri Devi, who was seen to be disfavoured by Indira Gandhi, her political opponent. The former Maharani of the earstwhile princely state of Jaipur had defeated the Congress thrice to reach the Lok Sabha, even in the Congress era. The treasure hunt at the Jaigarh Fort began just then, following the arrest of Gayatri Devi under the COFEPOSA Act, in a foreign currency case. The Act had to do with conservation of foreign exchange and prevention of smuggling activities. Indira Gandhi, reportedly advised by her son Sanjay Gandhi, commenced the five-month-long treasure hunt. A combined team of the Income Tax Department, the Army and the local police marched into the Jaigarh Fort, which had not seen such interest and footfall in the past. The news of the squad walking in brought back the 'seven magical treasuries of Amber' into the collective consciousness of the locals. The Archaeological Survey of India was roped in too. The eyes of the world were focused on the day-to-day happenings in Jaigarh during the wealth-diggings of 1976, according to the book Jaigarh, The Invincible Fort of Amber. \"It is also to be seen whether the Guinness Book of Records have taken note of this,\" write RS Khangarot and PS Nathawat in their 1990 book on the Jaigarh fort. \"As army helicopters would fly in and out of the fort, speculation about the treasure being found intensified, which was further fuelled by the visit of Indira's heir apparent Sanjay Gandhi on a chopper. The Jaigarh Fort was dug up and ravaged,\" says senior crime journalist Shams Taahir Khan in a Crime Tak story. The surroundings of the Fort were cordoned off, which further spread the treasure hunt news, and eventually got to Pakistan and prompted Bhutto to write the letter to Indira Gandhi and claim the treasure, banking on an agreement between the two countries. Indira Gandhi's replied to the letter from Pakistan's Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto only after the hunt was called off in November 1976. \"I had asked our legal experts to give careful consideration to the claim you made on behalf of Pakistan. They are of the clear opinion that the claim has no legal basis,\" Indira wrote back after five months. While she rubbished the Pakistani claim, she informed Zulfikar Ali Butto, \"Incidentally, the 'treasure' has turned out to be non-existent\". Gayatri Devi spent a bit more than five months in Delhi's Tihar Jail and was released after the Emergency was lifted. \"Indira Gandhi officially informed that no treasure was found in the Jaigarh Fort. Just 230 kg of silver was found,\" says Shams Taahir Khan. However, even after the raid ended and the announcement of the findings was made, a few questions still remained. Why was the 1726-built Jaigarh Fort raided, if Man Singh hid the Afghan treasure in the Amber Fort, probably during the last two decades of the 16th century? The high-profile Sanjay Gandhi visit had already given birth to various hypotheses. \"The government's silence on why the Delhi-Jaipur highway was closed for a day which saw 50–60 trucks moving from Jaipur to Delhi,\" says the Crime Tak story as it notes another lingering unanswered question. The answer to the choice of Jaigarh Fort, over the Amber Fort, where Man Singh hid the treasure, according to the Shams Taahir Khan report, is a tunnel connecting the Jaigarh Fort atop the Aravalis, overlooking the Amber Fort. It is still a mystery where the treasure from the Afghan expedition went. Some claim that the treasure was used in building the city of Jaipur by the Maharaja. Questions aside, Indira Gandhi's gold hunt in the Jaigarh Fort during the Emergency, targeting the ex-Maharani's glory, sparked debate if it was really a treasure hunt or a witch-hunt. Given the hopeless and the undesirable yield of the treasure hunt, authors RS Khangarot and PS Nathawat, called it to be \"a wild goose hunt\", in the concluding chapter of their book named, 'Jaigarh, The Invincible Fort of Amber'."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Director Sanjay Leela Bhansali debuted on Netflix with his eight-episode drama series 'Heeramandi', based on the life and times of the courtesans of the walled city of Lahore before the Partition. While the series is a period drama based in the 1920s, when the lavish lanes of Heera Mandi were going through a difficult phase, the locality has a fascinating history written in royalty through the times of the Mughals to the Sikh empire. Long before the Sikhs led by Maharaja Ranjit Singh arrived in Lahore at the end of the 18th century, Heera Mandi was the centre of culture, arts, and trade besides its association with the courtesans and performers who entertained the elite of society. During the time of the Mughals, Heera Mandi was called Shahi Mohallah. There are different versions of how the locality got its current name. While some accounts state that it got its name due to the diamond (hira) trade in the area during the Mughals, it was under the Sikh empire that the locality was christened Heera Mandi. When the Sikhs conquered Lahore in 1799 under Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the empire's capital was Gujranwala. Both Lahore and Gujranwala are now in Pakistan. While there were strategic reasons why Maharaja Ranjit Singh shifted his capital to Lahore, he stayed and operated from the area till his death, partly because of his love for a courtesan -- Moran Sarkar. Here's the story of Heera Mandi, how it evolved under the rule of the Sikh Maharaja and how it got its current name. Heera Mandi's history goes back to the 17th Century. It was first called the 'Shahi Mohallah' or royal neighbourhood, and visited by princes and nobles. During the Mughal period, women from Afghanistan and Uzbekistan were brought to Heera Mandi to entertain the royal court. These women were trained in various arts, including classical kathak, mujra, thumri, ghazal, and dadra, and became tawaifs upon mastering classical dance and singing. Tawaifs were highly skilled in music, dance, and other arts and were influential, refined and valued. They were financially independent and possessed agency over their lives and choices. Though prostitution is forbidden in Islam, Shahi Mohallah continued to thrive under the patronage of Mughal rulers. Lahore was among the three power centres under the Mughal rule, the other two being Delhi and Agra. Its opulence shone bright, and it was reflected in Shahi Mohallah as well. The area reached its financial and cultural heights during the Mughal rule. But during the early 18th century, after the death of Aurangzeb, the Mughal empire started to wane. After Ahmad Shah Durrani and the Afghan forces entered Lahore on January 12, 1748, Shahi Mohallah was reduced to a hub of prostitution. The situation remained the same until Maharaja Ranjit Singh's conquest of Lahore in 1799. Ranjit Singh, the young chieftain of Shukerchakias, a Sikh group, seized Lahore at the age of 17 and proclaimed himself the Maharaja of Punjab in 1801. While the Maharaja was known for his military prowess, he was also a great lover of beauty and art. Shahi Mohallah attracted his attention. It was in March 1802, a few days before Holi, that Ranjit Singh came to know about Moran Sarkar, a 12-year-old Muslim dancer from Shahi Mohallah, considered a \"perfect model of beauty\" and well-versed in the arts of singing and dancing. The Maharaja sent word to her guardians living in the area of courtesans that he would visit them in the evening. In the evening, a thin, tall girl, dressed in a tight churidar pajama and a long white shirt received Ranjit Singh. Then she offered him a betel leaf containing some grains of saffron. Accompanied by six musicians on instruments, Moran began singing and dancing for Ranjit Singh. Her steps in dancing, the grace, the rhythm, her slow and steady movements of hands, arms, head, body and feet were mesmerising. The 21-year-old Maharaja was smitten. In 'History Of The Sikhs, Vol. V The Sikh Lion of Lahore', author Hari Ram Gupta mentions how Ranjit Singh started spending most of his time in the \"house of his beloved Moran\". \"He spent nights in the house of his beloved Moran, the dancing girl. His meals and other things were supplied to him there. During his morning exercise, Moran was seated on the same horse and off he went riding with her. No followers were permitted to accompany him. He generally had a full gallop in the level plain between the fort and the river. Ranjit Singh must have enjoyed the greatest glee when Moran feared a fall and cried to the utmost pleasure of the rider,\" notes Gupta, citing the Persian language text Ibrat Namah written by the contemporary Ali-ud-din. However, their proximity infuriated the Maharaja's elite and religious companions, who scoffed at Moran's social standing and religion. But Ranjit Singh's love for Moran knew no bounds. The Maharaja married her and elevated her from being just a royal concubine. Shortly after, he was summoned to Amritsar before the Akal Takht, the highest temporal body of the Sikh faith. The Maharaja obeyed. Akali Phula Singh denounced him in the open assembly for violating the social rules of the Khalsa. \"The Maharaja listened to his accusation in a spirit of humility, and stood penitent before the congregation. He begged forgiveness with folded hands again and again. Phula Singh declared that he must be given one hundred lashes on his bare back before the Panth. The Maharaja at once took off his shirt. He was tied to the trunk of a tamarind tree which stood in a wing of the Akal Takht with his hands bound on his back,\" notes Hari Ram Gupta. However, the audience could not see their beloved Maharaja go through the punishment and intensely burst into tears. The Akalis accepted the public sentiment and the Maharaja was let go with just one leash on his back. Ranjit Singh never asked Moran to convert to Sikhism. He also built a mosque in her honour at Pappar Mandi, near Shahi Mohallah, where Moran lived and ran her own court. Gold and silver coins were struck in her name. She was referred to as 'Moran Sarkar' in these coins. Ranjit Singh's conquest of Lahore revived the cultural and social status of Shahi Mohallah. Later, the Maharaja's Prime Minister, Hira Singh Dogra, envisioned using Shahi Mohallah as an economic hub, a food market, situated in the heart of Lahore. The grain market that Hira Singh Dogra established came to be known as 'Hira Singh di Mandi' (Hira Singh's market), and gradually, as 'Hira Mandi'. However, many believed that the name resonated with the women of the place, in admiration of their unparalleled beauty. However, after the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and the British colonisation of Punjab in 1849, the cultural aspects of traditional dance performances in Heera Mandi came to an end. The British, influenced by Victorian-era conservatism, made no distinction between cultured tawaifs (courtesans) and common prostitutes, dubbing both as fallen women. This, in turn, led to the elimination of the dance aspect from the livelihoods of the courtesans, confining them to sex work under a cloak of secrecy instead. Despite these challenges, Heera Mandi continued to produce some of the most famous stars of Pakistani cinema, with entertainers such as Noor Jahan, Mumtaz Shanti, and Khurshid Begum all hailing from the now infamous neighbourhood. Today, Heera Mandi is a husk of what it used to be. While in the daytime it operates like a normal market, in the nighttime, it turns into a red-light district that sees women indulging in the flesh trade. Rare romantic stories might still be emerging from those dark bylanes of Heera Mandi, but none that matches the tale of a maharajah's love for a courtesan that made him marry her."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story On a mildly cold February day in Bihar's Samastipur, more than 5,000 party workers and supporters gathered in anticipation to greet and meet former Bihar Chief Minister Karpoori Thakur. The messiah of the downtrodden was set to travel from Patna to Samastipur. The party workers, who were eagerly waiting with flowers and garlands for their beloved leader, were to soon receive a devastating news. Karpoori Thakur, popularly known as Jannayak (people's leader), didn't reach Samastipur, but the news of his death reached them through an All India Radio (AIR) broadcast. They at once rushed to Patna, about 90 kilometres away. The flowers and the garlands that had been waiting for Karpoori Thakur's grand welcome were used on his mortal remains. Karpoori Thakur, two-time Bihar Chief Minister, died of a massive cardiac arrest on February 17, 1988. This year, on his birth centenary, the President's office announced that Karpoori Thakur was awarded the Bharat Ratna , India's highest civilian award. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote how Thakur, with his relentless pursuit of social justice, created a positive impact on the lives of crores of people of the country. Karpoori Thakur was a true socialist stalwart. After having served Bihar and its people twice as the Chief Minister, he became a formidable opposition leader in the late 1970s. Known for his simplicity and grassroots connections, Thakur was loved by the masses and revered by the opposition too. His tenure as Bihar CM was marked by his commitment to social justice and uplift of the downtrodden. The marginalised considered him as their own. An old woman, who was stopped by Patna Superintendent of Police (SP) from going near Thakur's funeral procession, hit out at the SP, saying, \"tumhe kya hai, hamara beta mara hai (How does the death matter to you? It is our son who is dead)\". The SP was moved by her words and allowed her to go, noted senior journalist Ganga Prasad. Just weeks before his death, the Jannayak roared in the Bihar Assembly. He slammed the police for a case of custodial brutality in Deoghar district in South Bihar (now in Jharkhand). The two-time chief minister didn't accumulate any wealth. All Karpoori Thakur left behind were a few dhotis, round neck kurtas and a few artefacts for the museums to display later. However, as a wise man once said, \"If you have no enemies, it's a sign that you're doing a very poor job\", the \"tall\" socialist Karpoori Thakur from the Nai (barber) community was no exception. An upright, selfless leader, Thakur had unknowingly made some enemies along the way. Karpoori Thakur, after losing his CM's seat, was also forced to give up the Leader of Opposition's post. He was the Bihar Deputy CM in the Mahamaya Prasad Sinha Cabinet from (1967-1968), and around that time, a new breed of leaders had emerged following Jayprakash Narayan's Sampoorn Kranti and Ram Manohar Lohia's socialist calls. The young leaders were looking for a more political say and were more than willing to edge out the veteran socialists. There was also a scramble amongst the leaders to be the successor of Karpoori Thakur. Leaders like Lalu Prasad Yadav, Nitish Kumar, Sushil Kumar Modi, Sharad Yadav, Narendra Singh, Bashistha Narain Singh, Chandradeo Prasad Verma and Syed Shahabuddin emerged at the same time. Following the death, while the then Harnaut (Nalanda) MLA Nitish Kumar called it \"a great loss to the people of Bihar\", a young Lalu Prasad Yadav, who was in a race to inherit the legacy of Karpoori Thakur, was seen crying inconsolably. As several leaders across party lines rushed to pay tributes to Karpoori Thakur at his official residence, 1, Deshratna Marg, Lalu Prasad Yadav was one of them. He was seen sitting near the body of Thakur and crying inconsolably. Lalu was even cradling Thakur's head at his residence, notes Patna-based senior journalist Santosh Singh and academic Aditya Anmol in their book, The Jannayak -- Karpoori Thakur Voice of the Voiceless. The book, published by Penguin, will be out later in May. The Jannayak -- Karpoori Thakur Voice of the Voiceless by Santosh Singh and Aditya Anmol will be out in the last week of May 2024. Lalu Prasad even pushed a few senior leaders aside, to make way for the lorry (being used as a hearse) and stood by the body, next to Karpoori Thakur's sons. \"This created the first visual of Lalu as the next leader after Karpoori,\" notes Santosh Singh in the book. Karpoori Thakur had a 'love-hate relationship' with MLA Lalu Prasad Yadav due to the latter's \"flippant ways of rising in politics\", according to The Jannayak -- Karpoori Thakur Voice of the Voiceless. Lalu Prasad Yadav once flatly refused to lend his jeep for a brief while to ailing Karpoori Thakur , who never owned a car until his death. Lalu told Karpoori Thakur that there was no fuel in his jeep. He even taunted Karpoori Thakur that he had been CM twice, so he should have bought a car at least, noted senior journalist Surendra Kishore. Although Karpoori Thakur suffered a minor heart attack two years before his death in 1988, and had a history of hypertension, the death of Bihar's beloved son at the age of 64, didn't seem straight to many. Many of those mourning Thakur saw a trail of mysterious incidents leading to his death. \"Karpoori's death left behind an unresolved mystery. An ardent Karpoori Thakur follower and MLA Raghuvansh Prasad Singh wrote to PM Rajiv Gandhi on 22 February 1988, demanding a high-level enquiry into Thakur's death,\" journalist Santosh Singh writes in The Jannayak -- Karpoori Thakur Voice of the Voiceless. The chapter is titled 'The Salty Solution and the Death Mystery'. The doubts crept into people's minds due to the appearance of a yoga practitioner, Atulanand, into Karpoori Thakur's life from nowhere. Thakur was known to take health advice from anyone and everyone, and Atulanand had put him on a rare yoga regimen. Those close to Thakur suspected Atulanand might have been linked to politicians who stood to gain from his death. \"Many kinds of doubts started cropping in the hearts and minds of the people. This has been confirmed by the reputed newspapers of Bihar and the country. People are taking the sudden death of Thakur as part of a bigger conspiracy,\" MLA Raghuvansh Prasad Singh wrote to Rajiv Gandhi, days after Karpoori Thakur's death. \"So far, no effort has been made by the government to nab Atulanand and to prove our doubts unfounded. Rather, doubts are getting stronger. In such a situation, when the whole of Bihar is agitated by the death of Karpoori Thakur, people have started considering his death as a part of murder and a bigger conspiracy,\" added the letter to Rajiv Gandhi. These talks of a potential conspiracy gained strength with the story of the salty solution and absconding Atulanand. Karpoori Thakur had been under his treatment for some time. Atulanand was a 45-year-old ambitious Ayurveda practitioner from Saharsa (Koshi region) and was introduced to Karpoori Thakur, who easily took health advice from anyone. \"My father had known Atulanand since 1985. We were not convinced about the salty water treatment,\" recalled Dr Birendra Thakur, the son of BJP leader Dr CP Thakur who held the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (2000-2002) in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Cabinet. Atulanand's abruptly shaving his long hair and disappearing after Karpoori Thakur's demise raised suspicions. \"Karpoori Thakur's family confirmed that on 16 February 1988 (a day before Karpoori Thakur's death), Swami Atulanand made Karpoori Thakur drink and vomit 13 litres of salty water on an empty stomach... Atulanand had convinced Thakur to drink and vomit rock-salt lukewarm water as part of some Sankhya yogic treatment,\" writes Santosh Singh in his new book. Administration of salt, which has a direct correlation with blood pressure, must have proved fatal. It's common knowledge that consumption of salt raises blood pressure. One can only imagine what damage the month-long administration of salty water might have done to Karpoori Thakur, a patient of hypertension who had suffered a mild heart attack a couple of years ago. The same concern was flagged by Dr CP Thakur, his personal doctor since 1976. \"Karpoori Thakur discussed the saltwater treatment with me. I had strictly advised him against it as salt -- induced blood pressure often does not subside and could result in cardiac arrest. I do not know the circumstances under which Thakur took that treatment, which could have been primarily responsible for his death,\" revealed Dr CP Thakur in a 2003 interview. \"One had the right to know the credentials of Atulanand, and why was he never searched and questioned? Who knows if Thakur's death was part of some political conspiracy?,\" added the veteran doctor. Atulanand was never to be seen again, and doubts grew. \"At the same time, many big leaders were successful in convincing his family members that there was no conspiracy behind Thakur's death,\" writes Santosh Singh. Questions over Karpoori Thakur's mysterious death still pop up regularly in Bihar. Several leaders, including Lalu Prasad Yadav and BJP's Nityanand Rai have questioned the death, its circumstances, and the fact that an enquiry was never ordered on Karpoori Thakur's death. The earliest demand for an investigation was made by Karpoori Thakur's ardent disciple, MLA Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, in his letter to PM Rajiv Gandhi in 1988, seeking a high-level enquiry. He even wrote to the newly appointed Bihar CM Bhagwat Jha Azad. However, the Congress leader, who took oath just four days ago in February 1988, did not take any action. In 2017, Nityanand Rai, the then president of Bihar BJP, talked about the mysterious death of Karpoori Thakur. On Karpoori Thakur Jayanti, January 24, he said the death was \"not natural\" but a \"murder\". He also demanded an investigation into the matter by the then Bihar government. Lalu Prasad Yadav, who went on to become the leader of Bihar for at least a couple of decades, said Karpoori Thakur died a premature death because of torture by his political opponents. \"Shivchandra Jha was then speaker of Bihar assembly. Karpoori ji was the leader of the opposition in the house. He was so tortured in those days that he used to frequently rush to my quarter to narrate his woes. He was tortured inside and outside the assembly,\" said Lalu Prasad in 2016. In 2021, RJD leader Nishindra Kinjalk demanded a high-level enquiry into the death. He, too, suspected a conspiracy behind the death of Karpoori Thakur. He even spoke about a letter that Karpoori Thakur had written in 1984, four years before his death, to Bihar's Chief Secretary, expressing fear that he might be murdered. The beacon of social justice died and requests for a probe fell on deaf ears. Bharat Ratna Karpoori Thakur, who brought the first reservations for backward classes, will always be remembered for his service to the downtrodden. Will also be remembered are the questions surrounding his death that are still unanswered."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Ever since the Congress manifesto for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections was released on April 5, it has been a hot topic for discussion. Besides promises, including a nationwide caste census and jobs guarantee, it is the party's stand on the Indian economy that has been at the centre of debates. The party's 2024 manifesto refers to the liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms of 1991, crediting them of lifting millions of people out of poverty. And while former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao and then Finance Minister Manmohan Singh are credited for bringing the reforms, the foundations were laid with the release of the Congress election manifesto in 1991 by ex-PM Rajiv Gandhi. Rajiv Gandhi, who was likely on his way back to power at the Centre in 1991, was killed in a suicide bomb attack by Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) terrorists in Tamil Nadu's Sriperumbudur on May 21, 1991. A month before his assassination, he released the Congress manifesto, which promised to bring radical changes to liberalise the economy from the clutches of the Licence Raj. The Licence Raj , also known as the Permit Raj, was a system of strict government control and regulation of the Indian economy that was in place from the 1950s to the early 1990s. Under this system, businesses in India were required to obtain licences from the government in order to operate, and these licences were often difficult to obtain. The term \"Licence Raj\" is a play on the \"British Raj\", which refers to the period of British rule in India, and was coined by freedom fighter and statesman Chakravarti Rajagopalachari. The Licence Raj was intended to protect Indian industry, promote self-reliance, and ensure regional equality. However, it led to a system where up to 80 government agencies had to be satisfied before private companies could produce something, and if granted permission, the government would regulate production. This system was criticised for stifling economic growth and preventing the Indian economy from reaching its full potential. Rajiv Gandhi's government began to loosen restrictions on business creation and import controls, promoting the growth of industries such as digitalisation, telecommunications, and software. These efforts led to an increase in the average GDP growth rate from 2.9% in the 1970s to 5.6%, although they failed to address systemic issues with the Licence Raj. Brought up in an independent India and coming with no ideological baggage, Rajiv Gandhi soon realised the aspirations of a new India. He reduced income and corporate tax rates, and tried to simplify the licensing system and deregulated sectors like computers, textiles and drugs. In telecommunications, Rajiv Gandhi dissolved the P&T Department and created the Department of Telecommunication in 1985. He also ended the government monopoly on the manufacture of telecommunications equipment, and allowed the private sector into it in the mid-1980s. In 1989, Rajiv Gandhi lost power at the Centre due to increasing allegations of corruption and other factors, including appeasement politics. However, two years later, the voters again got a chance to elect their prime minister as the Chandra Shekhar-led coalition government fell in 16 months. Rajiv Gandhi, seeking another term as prime minister, released the Congress manifesto on April 15, 1991, promising continuation of his economic liberalisation policies. Some of the major promises mentioned in the Congress manifesto were: - Maintain stable tax rates through the fiscal year in respect of Customs and Excise Duties - Throw open construction of highways and tool bridges to private and joint sectors - Abolish the monopoly of any sector or any individual enterprise in any field of manufacturing (except on strategic or military considerations) and throw them open to competition - The Congress government, in the first 1,000 days, will oversee the gradual withdrawal of the public sector from areas where the private and joint sectors have developed capabilities. - The Congress will tackle the problem of the present foreign exchange crisis by pursuing vigorous export promotion, effective import substitution, establishing and increasing productivity and efficiency in the economy. However, before he could see his party back at the Centre and usher in a new economic era, Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by LTTE terrorists. His death fuelled emotional support for the Congress and the party returned to power with the support of the Janata Dal. PV Narasimha Rao became the Prime Minister of the coalition government with Manmohan Singh as his finance minister. On July 24, 1991, Manmohan Singh presented the revolutionary Budget which changed the economic landscape of India. This Budget marked the end of the Licence Raj, and it came at a time when India faced an economic crisis with only two weeks of foreign reserves left. The Budget clearly had the imprints of the Congress manifesto released by Rajiv Gandhi and during his speech, Manmohan Singh mentioned the former prime minister eight times. \"Thanks to the efforts of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, we have developed a well diversified industrial structure. This constitutes a great asset as we begin to implement various structural reforms. However, barriers to entry and limits on growth in the size of firms, have often led to a proliferation of licensing and an increase in the degree of monopoly,\" said Manmohan Singh in his speech, as he began to bring down the Licence Raj. Just as mentioned in the Congress manifesto, the Budget allowed more participation by private players, lowered excise duty and welcomed foreign direct investment (FDI). Industrial licensing was abolished for almost all product categories, except for a few sensitive areas like alcohol, tobacco, hazardous chemicals, industrial explosives, electronics, aerospace, and pharmaceuticals. Tariff rates were reduced, and import restrictions were eased, encouraging competition and efficiency. Export incentives were introduced to boost foreign trade. The government also opened up sectors like telecommunications, insurance, and banking to foreign direct investment (FDI), attracting much-needed capital and technology. The Licence Raj had a significant impact on consumerism and the way normal Indians shopped. With the government controlling production and prices, there was a lack of competition, leading to low-quality products and a limited range of choices for consumers. The system also restricted the ability of businesses to innovate and respond to changing market conditions, which further limited consumer options. The end of the Licence Raj led to the rise of entrepreneurs in India, as freedom from regulations allowed more people to seek out entrepreneurship and changed the landscape drastically as competition replaced connection. The import restrictions and production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes did not prevent the use of foreign goods and services but rather invited them to help India's manufacturing sector grow. The economic changes offered more options to choose from, from brands of pens to cars, to consumers in India. The result was for everyone to see. India surpassed the 2-3% Hindu rate of growth to 6-7% annually, and the economy became one of the fastest-growing in the world. In 2024, while the Congress's election manifesto talks about the benefits the 1991 reforms brought to the country, it emphasises the need for a \"re-set of economic policy\". \"While a Congress government in 1991 abolished industrial licensing and controls, the independent regulatory regime that was put in place has deteriorated into a system of overt and covert controls. We will conduct a comprehensive review of the current rules and regulations and repeal or amend them in order to restore freedom to industry, business and trade,\" the manifesto reads. \"After 33 years, the time is ripe for a re-set of economic policy. We need a Nav Sankalp Economic Policy. The cornerstone of the Nav Sankalp Economic Policy will be JOBS. To create jobs, India must become a producing economy. We must produce goods and services for ourselves and for the world. There is a huge opportunity for India to emerge as the world's biggest producer,\" it adds. The Congress manifesto of 2024 reiterates its \"commitment to an open economy\". But there are two things that will decide if the poll document gets implemented. First, the Congress needs to be voted to power at the Centre. Even if that happens, it might be difficult to keep its promises in the face of alliance push and pulls. However, the importance of the 1991 manifesto is highlighted by the fact that the Congress refers to it even after two decades and the Indian consumer is spoilt for choice."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story It was 21 August 1978, a man in his mid-forties, dazed and bruised, rushed into Delhi's Kashmere Gate Police Station. He wanted to file an FIR. The man claimed that at least a dozen burly men kidnapped him the night before (August 20, 1978) and forced him to drive his Mercedes-Benz car to Modinagar (near Meerut) at gunpoint. A 21-year-old woman who was with him in the car, was also kidnapped, he said. He told the police that the men beat him until he became unconscious after he refused to comply, demanding he sign a few papers. The man also revealed that he had been told that those men took his compromising photographs with the girl. Those 40-50 photos of intimacy went on to translate into Independent India's first political sex scandal. The scandal, involving the high-profile Mercedes-Benz-driving victim not only rocked the nation, but buried the prime ministerial ambitions of a veteran politician, who had come very close to the top job in New Delhi. If there were still photographs in 1978, there are videotapes in 2024. A massive sex scandal, involving the family member of a former Prime Minister and his son, a sitting MP, is making headlines. The massive sex scandal rocked Karnataka and the entire country last month. Former Prime Minister Gowda's son HD Revanna, and his MP son Prajwal Revanna were caught in a political storm, after reports of around 3,000 obscene video clips, photos and documents of alleged sexual assault and abuse against several women became public. A protestor burning a poster of Prajwal Revanna. (Image: PTI) People burnt posters of Prajwal Revanna during a protest against his involvement in the alleged sexual abuse case. In the meantime, Pranjwal fled to Germany using his diplomatic passport. Rape charges were added to the FIR against Prajwal Revanna. Deve Gowda's son, HD Revanna, was arrested too. Deve Gowda, a former PM, came under massive opposition attack. His party, the JD(S), had allied with the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) to contest the 2024 Lok Sabha Election. Following all the criticisms and a stern warning from his grandfather, Deve Gowda, Prajwal Revanna finally landed back in Bengaluru early on Friday. Prajwal was arrested by an all-woman police team . An all-women police team arrested the JD(S) MP at Bengaluru airport, and took him to the CID office. (ANI Screengrab) A similar situation unfolded nearly 26 years back and hit a PM aspirant hard. The man filing an FIR in Kashmere Gate Police Station, in his mid-forties, was the flamboyant MLA from Bihar, Suresh Kumar Ram. He was the son of 'Babu' Jagjivan Ram, the champion of the backward classes. Babu Jagjivan Ram was then India's Defence Minister in the Morarji Desai Cabinet. And the 21-year-old woman was Suresh Kumar Ram's girlfriend, Sushma Chaudhary, a college student from a Jat family in Meerut. A sketch of Sushma Chaudhary (L) and a photo of Suresh Kumar Ram (R). (Image: India Today) Jagjivan Ram, who had also been the Deputy Prime Minister of India since 1977, saw his image and reputation dented after his son Suresh Kumar Ram's sex scandal became public. A day later, when details of the incident came to light, the news shook the nation and more so, sent shockwaves across political circles, which an IndiaToday Magazine of September 1978 described as having \"all the makings of a political intrigue, criminal frame-up and caste warfare. It had shades of Watergate and tinges of an exciting paperback thriller\". While The Indian Express carried the news, saying, 'Abduction of Defence Minister Jagjivan Ram's son and his girlfriend rocks the nation', the India Today Magazine, days later, headlined it, 'VVIP's son involved in sex racket'. And that is how India's first ever political sex scandal broke to the public. Suresh Kumar Ram was 40, married and had a daughter. His girlfriend was all of 21. The sex scandal dashed the prime ministerial aspirations of Babu Jagjivan Ram, who was a frontrunner for the top job. Morarji Desai's government was already showing signs of falling. A former Congressman, Jagjivan Ram, had joined hands with the makeshift Janta Party in 1977, after the Emergency. Jagjivan Ram, who by then had held almost every important ministry for 31 straight years, including labour, communications, railways and defence, was aspiring for the Prime Minister's chair. \"Iss kambakht mulk mein chamar kabhie prime minister nahin ho sakta hail,\" (In this wretched country a cobbler can never become the prime minister), Jagjivan Ram once said in the mid-1970s. Although he knew it was an uphill task, he did not give up. However, the road to the highest political office had hurdles in the form of two seasoned politicians, who wanted the PM's post, perhaps more than Jagjivan Ram did. One was the former PM Indira Gandhi. Jagjivan Ram had been Indira's close aide throughout the Emergency. He had also been an important member of the various Jawaharlal Nehru cabinets since independence. Indira, who was defeated in the post-Emergency general election of 1977, by the Janta Party, was away from power for a while. She was, therefore, constantly on the look-out for cracks to get her way back to power. \"She (Indira Gandhi) knew she could not risk Babuji (Jagjivan Ram) as PM, even as a stopgap,\" noted veteran journalist Neerja Chowdhury, in her book 'How Prime Ministers Decide'. Another hurdle was Charan Singh, a comrade of Jagjivan Ram, from the Janta Party. \"Both Charan Singh and Indira Gandhi knew he (Jagjivan Ram) was the only other serious contender for the top job, and would need to be marginalised if their plan were to succeed,\" wrote Neerja Chowdhury in her 2023 book. As the news became public, it brought Jagjivan Ram and his family, a significant embarrassment, which later undermined his credibility and left a blot on his image, enough to keep him from assuming the prized post at the PMO. Following the incident, \"Jagjivan Ram’s reputation nose-dived,\" and it \"proved to be a setback to his ambition\", according to Neerja Chowdhury's book. Jagjivan Ram, an honest politician, took moral responsibility for something that he didn't have anything to do with and distanced himself from power. However, the incident that blew up into India's first political sex-scandal was not a mere accident. It was a project, well-planned and executed. It was a result of the misadventures of Jagjivan Ram's privileged son, Suresh Kumar Ram, and sharp-eyed Janata party-men, Charan Singh and Raj Narain. Along with Charan Singh, author Neerja Chowdhury regarded socialist leader Raj Narain, who famously defeated Indira Gandhi in Raebareli in 1977, as \"the executor of 'Operation Suresh Ram'\". While Suresh Kumar's version of the incident, as per the FIR, exploded, Babu Jagjivan Ram stayed tight-lipped to India Today's persistent requests for reactions. And what actually transpired on August 20 was not public knowledge till then. The incident of August 20, was actually a \"result of two Janata Party workers, KC Tyagi and Om Pal Singh, who had been proteges of Raj Narain, and had been keeping Suresh Kumar Ram under surveillance for several days\", noted author Neerja Chowdhury in 'How Prime Ministers Decide'. \"On 21 August 1978, there was a car accident in front of the gates of the Mohan Meakin (manufacturer of the famous Old Monk rum) plant in Mohan Nagar on the outskirts of Delhi. The car, a Mercedes, hit a man who died on the spot. Inside the car were a man and a young woman. Fearful that they would be attacked by witnesses, they rushed towards the gates of the plant. The watchman, who had seen the accident, called up the office on the intercom. Anil Bali, then the manager, came out. He recognised Suresh Ram, son of Defence Minister Jagjivan Ram, and took him inside,\" wrote Chowdhury. Photos of Om Pal Singh (L) and KC Tyagi (R). (Image: India Today) Suresh Kumar Ram had told Bali that he was being followed by a few men. \"Babuji dekh lenge gari ko (My father will take care of the car),\" Suresh Ram told Bali about the damaged car and left for Delhi in one of Mohan Meakin's cars. What Suresh told Bali revealed what actually happened that day. The 40-50 compromising photographs, which Suresh claimed to have been taken, were actually with him in his car all this while. \"They knew he (Suresh) used to take photographs with a ‘polaroid camera’, to keep his girlfriend, Sushma Chaudhary, in check and get vicarious pleasure from the exercise. They wanted to lay their hands on the photos and found them in the glove compartment of the car Suresh Ram was driving,\" wrote Neerja Chowdhury in her 2023 book. The photos slipped out of the glove compartment after Om Pal Singh had asked Suresh Ram for cigarettes. More details of the compromising photographs of Suresh Kumar Ram and his girlfriend were later revealed by Raj Narain. The Mercedes Benz used by Suresh Kumar Ram being towed away (number plates removed) from Jagjivan Ram's residence in Delhi after the incident. (Image: India Today) \"Raj Narain is known for quoting from the Ramayana. But on this occasion he sounded as if he had got hold of the Kama-sutra,\" reported an India Today Magazine piece from August 1978. \"They were like what you see at Khajuraho. In fact, they were worse, said Raj Narain about the photos. \"Gesticulating for greater effect, he began explaining the lurid details of the sexual circus in shuddh Hindi. When he came to describing fellatio and cunnilingus, in the photographs he claimed to have seen, he found Hindi inadequate to show his indignation. He is very perverse\" (sic) he spat out in English,\" the India Today Magazine report added. Raj Narain claimed the photographs indicated that the couple had posed willingly. \"You can't force anyone to pose like that,\" claimed Narain. Most newspapers blanked out Raj Narain's graphic descriptions of the photographs in the interest of good taste. To control the damage, Jagjivan Ram met Raj Narain at Kapil Mohan's (Mohan Meakin's chief) house to strike a bargain, but it failed. He even lured Narain by saying, \"I am going to become PM soon. Let me know if you want anyone made minister.\" Failing to reach a deal, he left Kapil Mohan's house. \"Aaj yeh kaboo maen ayae (Today he has been tamed),\" Narain said after Jagjivan Ram left. After Jagjivan Ram left Kapil Mohan's home, his aide, Anil Bali, drove to Indira Gandhi's home to hand some of the compromising photos to her son, Sanjay Gandhi, on the liquor baron's insistence. Raj Narain. (Image: India Today) Woken up at 1 am, Sanjay Gandhi instructed Bali to \"keep KC Tyagi and Om Pal Singh somewhere safe\", while Indira Gandhi commanded Mohan's aide to \"keep Raj Narain under control\", according to the book 'How Prime Ministers Decide'. The photos were subsequently published by Sanjay Gandhi's wife Manaka Gandhi, in the Surya Magazine, which she edited. \"The photographs, across two pages, showing forty-six-year-old Suresh Ram and Sushma Chaudhary, 'indulging in sexual acrobatics'. The article was headlined, 'The Real Story',\" writes Neerja Chowdhury. \"By merely publishing the two-page spread of photographs showing Suresh Ram and his amorous mistress Sushma Chaudhury indulging in sexual acrobatics, Surya wanted to ensure its biggest sales since the halcyon days of the Emergency ,\" reported senior journalist Dilip Bob in his report for India Today Magazine in 1977. Maneka, however, refused to share with India Today any information regarding the reactions to the expose, legal or otherwise. \"...The controversial issue was not pushed out through regular distribution channels, but was sold to individual hawkers. Sanjay himself directed the operations,\" added Dilip Bob in the report. Sales of the Surya Magazine, which had dropped after the Emergency, soared, while Jagjivan Ram's reputation nosedived. \"The Surya issue was even blackmarketed,\" Neerja Chowdhury told the BBC. The political damage to Jagjivan Ram due to his son's sex scandal proved irreparable. Despite becoming the leader of the opposition in 1979 and making a record with his uninterrupted parliamentary run from until 1986, Jagjivan Ram never got the cherished chair. Independent India's first political sex scandal dashed a prime ministerial dream. The burden of son Suresh Kumar Ram's scandal and his death in mysterious circumstances a few years later shattered Babu Jagjivan Ram. It can be understood by what he told one of his few remaining confidants, Krishan Kant, \"Main toot gaya hoon\" (I am a broken man)."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Narendra Modi is set to take oath as the prime minister for his third consecutive term, equalling the record of Jawaharlal Nehru. While he could not steer his party, the BJP, to a clear majority, retaining the top seat in the largest democracy for a third term is no mean feat. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of Independent India, remained in power from the day of Independence on August 15, 1947 to May 27, 1964, when he died of a heart attack. Unlike Modi, Nehru did not face a strong opposition as the Congress, the only state and national-level political party at the time, reigned supreme. He won his three terms at Centre with a brute majority. However, despite another landslide win in the 1962 Lok Sabha election, Nehru faced challenges rising from within and outside the Congress, especially from regional parties, questioning his authority. The 1951-52 general elections were the first in Independent India, held from October 1951 to February 1952. The Congress, under Nehru's leadership, emerged victorious, securing 364 of the 489 seats in the Lok Sabha. This amounted to around 75% of the total seats. The 1957 elections reinforced Nehru's dominance in Indian politics. The Congress won 371 out of 494 seats in the Lok Sabha, slightly increasing its tally from the previous election. Not only at the national level, but the Congress's rule in states also remained unchallenged until 1957, when it was defeated by the Communist Party of India (CPI) in Kerala. There were several reasons for the Congress's landslide wins. Firstly, the Congress was the only pan-India party. The party's involvement in India's struggle for Independence and association with national heroes like Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru himself contributed to its widespread popularity. Additionally, Nehru's charisma and leadership skills helped maintain the party's unity and appeal. He was seen as a leader who had the best interests of the country at heart and someone who could be trusted to lead India through its early years of Independence. The Opposition was fragmented and lacked the organisational strength and leadership to mount a serious challenge to the Congress. Parties like the Communist Party of India and the Bharatiya Jana Sangh were still in their nascent stages and could not significantly dent the Congress's dominance. While people across the country unanimously accepted Nehru's leadership, the state and local leadership of the Congress was increasingly being questioned. The party leadership at state level was clustered with castes and classes dominant in the region, like the Marathas in Maharashtra, Patels in Gujarat, Reddy's in Andhra Pradesh. In her paper 'Regional parties and the emerging pattern of politics in India', author and political scientist Professor Sudha Pai notes that during the Nehru era, the major electoral base of the Congress was the Hindi heartland. In 1957, the Congress won 90% more seats and 2% more votes in the heartland than its national average, and its performance on both these counts was better than in any other region. One of the reasons, Pai states, was linguistic homogeneity. This delayed the rise of sub-regional movements to emerge in these states, unlike in West Bengal and southern states, where the Left parties were looking to express regional aspirations. \"There is no doubt that central domination was due to the existence of a single political party at both the central and state level. This factor both made possible strengthened the other centralising factors. Indian federalism developed in a 'one party dominance system'. Other parties could operate within the country's broad democratic framework, but their homogeneity and weakness prevented them from exercising an important influence upon the operative machinery of Indian federalism,\" Professor Pai notes. However, 1957 was the year when the Congress's electoral bull run was halted. The Congress lost the state election in Kerala, with CPI winning 60 out of 126 assembly seats. Factionalism within the party significantly contributed to the party's defeat. Prominent Congress leaders such as Pattom Thanu Pillai, TM Varghese, and R Shankar were often at odds with each other. These rivalries were fuelled by personal ambitions and ideological differences, leading to a lack of coherent strategy and leadership. The CPI unit, led by EMS Namboodiripad, who later became the chief minister, campaigned on promises of agrarian reforms, removal of unemployment, and elimination of corruption. Besides CPI, another political force was rising the ladder of power in the South. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), founded by CN Annadurai, was gaining ground in Tamil Nadu. The party, though formed in 1949, entered politics in 1957 and started cornering the Congress over issues like alleged Hindi imposition. The DMK promoted Dravidian ideology and ran a radical, separatist campaign, pitching for a separate country for Tamils called 'Dravida Nadu'. They opposed the dominance of North Indians and Brahmin culture, which they associated with the Congress. In 1961, Jawaharlal Nehru held a National Integration Conference to promote national unity to address the challenges of a diverse society marked by linguistic, religious, and cultural differences. One of the primary topics was the linguistic diversity in India. Discussions focused on the adoption of Hindi as the official language while ensuring the protection and promotion of regional languages to maintain cultural diversity. This gave fodder to DMK's propaganda as they accused the government of planning to impose a Sanskritised language on a Dravidian society. It became the focal point of the party's protest against the Congress. And the results were visible in the 1962 general elections, when the DMK won seven Lok Sabha seats. Despite his tall status, Nehru witnessed increasing criticism within the Congress party. This became evident with the 1959 All India Congress Committee session in Nagpur when Chaudhary Charan Singh criticised the Cooperative Farming Resolution. The Cooperative Farming Resolution was part of Nehru's vision for agricultural development, but it faced opposition from various quarters. Charan Singh's criticism at the Nagpur session reflected the concerns of many farmers and regional leaders who felt that the resolution would lead to the loss of individual landholdings and the concentration of power in the hands of the state. This opposition was not limited to Charan Singh. Another regional leader, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, popularly known as Rajaji, was critical of Nehru's economic policies and the increasing influence of socialism. He resigned from the Congress in 1959 and formed the Swatantra Party, which favoured a free-market policy. Despite the growing criticism and influence of regional parties, the Brand Nehru was unaffected as the prime minister won his third term by winning 361 out of 494 Lok Sabha seats. The CPI stood second with 29 seats and Rajaji's Swatantra Party won 18 seats. Nehru was aware of the growing dissent. In his speech in Lok Sabha on March 19, 1962, he lamented the separatist voices during the election campaign, specifically mentioning the DMK. \"... I suppose, the most fundamental thing of all and all the tendencies which have been so obvious in this election, caste tendency, communal tendencies and the like which are harmful and which disintegrate the country have to be met as far as possible unitedly. Hon. Members know that a party has risen in the South... Yes DMK. It talks loosely and wildly about separating from India,\" he said. Nehru also lashed out at the opposition parties for the charges they levelled against the Congress, including that of corruption. \"I do not pretend to say that Congress candidates were virtuous angels. But I do say -- that is my impression -- that I was shocked beyond measure at what the opponents of the Congress did in these elections. They were beyond excuse -- of course it is a weak word. Some of the things done were so abhorrent and abominable that I was amazed at them,\" he said. \"I do not wish to name any party or anybody. But they lacked the commonest decency. Maybe some individual Congressmen had done so. But there it is not an individual Congressman or an individual member of a party but groups functioning in that way, and large numbers of them,\" the Prime Minister added. In his third term, Nehru's government faced several challenges. The war with China in October 1962 dealt a significant blow to Nehru's foreign policy doctrine of Panchsheel, and the Congress party suffered defeats in several bypolls held between the 1962 Lok Sabha election and July 1963. These setbacks allowed opposition leaders like Acharya JB Kripalani, Ram Manohar Lohia, and Deendayal Upadhyaya to gain ground, eventually leading to the first no-confidence motion against Nehru's government in August 1963 . While Nehru managed to defeat the motion, it became an epochal moment when the Opposition challenged the might of the tall Congressman. Winning consecutive general elections in India is an uphill task. Voters' sentiments and their aspirations change over five years. To win three successive terms as prime minister while being the face of the party, a leader has to be larger-than-life and someone who enjoys the trust of the masses. Modi, just like Nehru, possesses the two qualities. As Narendra Modi steps into his third term amid a more fragmented political scenario, Nehru's legacy serves as a reminder of the evolving dynamics of Indian democracy. While Nehru had to deal with the regional forces and their ambitions outside his party, Modi would have to be more accommodating to their demands as they helped him win his third term."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story \"Cricket was America's first modern team sport\" For the unversed, this may sound unbelievable. The United States of America is crazy about team sports such as baseball and basketball. Cricket is considered mostly an immigrant phenomenon which is taking baby steps towards fulfilling its American Dream. Their cricket team, consisting of mainly Indian and Caribbean immigrants , is proving to be a giant killer in the ongoing T20 World Cup, having already knocked out Pakistan, which is a full-time member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). But the gentleman's game has a long history in the US. Long before baseball claimed the American sports landscape, cricket was a prominent and popular game, embraced by a diverse array of players across the young nation. George B Kirsch, a sports historian who was a Professor of History at Manhattan College, wrote in his 1984 paper 'American cricket: Players and clubs before the Civil War' that cricket may not have flourished in the US, but its early enthusiasts did contribute much to the rise of modern American team sports. Let's trace the origins, rise, and eventual decline of cricket in the US -- its journey from a colonial pastime to a nearly forgotten sport and the attempts for its revival. The British colonists brought cricket to North America as early as the 17th century, though the first documented version of the game is recorded in 1709 in a diary entry of William Byrd II, a prominent writer, satirist and diarist of pre-Revolutionary America. In his diary entry dated May 6, 1709, Byrd wrote, \"I rose at 6 o’clock and Colonel Ludwell, Nat Harrison, Mr Edwards and myself played at cricket, and I won a bit. Then we played at whist and I won (sic).\" In 1751, the New York Gazette and the Weekly Post Boy published the earliest known report of a cricket match in North America, detailing a game between a team from London and a team from New York City. Sketch of a cricket game being played before the 18th century. (Source: www.icc-cricket.com) For the British colonists who settled in North America, cricket was a pastime. By the mid-1700s, cricket had spread to other territories, with matches being reported in Virginia and Pennsylvania. After 1783, when the American Revolution ended, the interest in all things British waned in America. But cricket continued to thrive and by the mid-1800s, the sport was being played in 22 states. Cricket was also introduced in schools and universities, with institutions like Haverford College and the University of Pennsylvania incorporating the sport into their athletic programmes. The 19th century marked the golden age of cricket in the US. During this period, cricket was the dominant bat-and-ball sport, even more popular than baseball. In his paper 'American cricket: Players and clubs before the Civil War' published in the 'Journal of Sport History', George Kirsch wrote, \"The sport's modern phase began with the founding of New York's St George Cricket Club in 1839, and Philadelphia's Union Club in 1843. By 1850, at least twenty organisations in more than a dozen American communities fielded elevens, enrolling perhaps five hundred active players.\" In 1844, the first international cricket match was played between the US and Canada in New York, in which the former emerged victorious. This historic cricket match is recognised as the first international sporting event in the world, predating even the first modern Olympic Games. Haverford College's cricket team in 1902. (Source: usacricket.org) Philadelphia, in particular, emerged as a cricketing hub. The Philadelphia Cricket Club, established in 1854, is one of the oldest cricket clubs in the United States. Matches drew large crowds, and cricket was a regular feature in newspapers and periodicals. George Kirsch explained the craze of cricket as \"once bitten by the cricket bug, those addicted devoted countless hours to its pleasures and pain\". While baseball had long been a \"familiar child's game in the United States\", Kirsch explained that cricket, despite being a British pastime, attracted significant numbers of Americans, especially in New York and Philadelphia. And while the American baseball players were amateurs, there were a few professional cricketers in the United States who competed for both the love of the sport and for money, as per Kirsch. The Philadelphian cricket team during its tour of England in 1884. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) Despite this, cricket remained a British phenomenon, dominated by those belonging to the middle and upper class. And they made no effort to popularise the game beyond the power centres of New York and Philadelphia, especially after the end of the American Civil War in 1865. The American Civil War, which took place from 1861 to 1865, proved to be a death knell for cricket in the US. Jason Kaufman and Orlando Patterson, in their paper 'Cross-national cultural diffusion: The global spread of cricket', note that \"the extent to which an elite cultural practice like cricket was shared with or shielded from the general population was a direct result of the elites’ own sense of their place atop the social hierarchy. Had American elite cricketers felt less anxious about their social position, for example, they might have popularised the sport along the same lines as baseball (or golf or tennis)\". Besides this, the Civil War caused widespread disruption across the US. Men who would have been playing and promoting cricket were instead enlisted in the military. Cricket clubs lost many of their members to the war, and matches were cancelled. The Civil War also saw a cultural shift in American sports as baseball began to be seen as a more American sport compared to cricket, which had a strong British association. The post-war period was a time of growing American nationalism, and baseball fit well into this cultural shift. In their paper 'Why baseball, why cricket? Differing nationalisms, differing challenges', Boria Majumdar and Sean Brown write that \"Baseball's association, with the season cycle, its trend towards extreme quantification, rural nostalgia, its ability to produce folk heroes and as 'a compensatory mechanism for the travails of industrial life', all of which are seen as something intrinsic to the American character\". But baseball didn't only have a cultural advantage. The simplicity of the game compared to cricket, requiring less equipment and fewer players, made it more accessible. After the Civil War, it became extremely difficult to organise cricket matches due to the unavailability of suitable grounds. \"Cricketers had more trouble than baseball players in finding and improving a good field, for cricket required a well-manicured grass surface for high-quality performance,\" according to George Kirsch. Philadelphian Bart King, popularly known as the 'King of Swing'. (Source: usacricket.org) Cricket, however, experienced a revival from the 1870s onwards. Players such as John Barton King, the proponent of swing bowling, emerged in Philadelphia. King's tours with the Philadelphians to England and Australia created waves, as both cricketing giants began to take notice of American cricket. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, often referred to as the Bible of Cricket, recognised King as one of the finest bowlers of all time. However, cricket could never again compete with baseball as either a participatory or a spectator sport in the US. By the early 20th century, cricket found its new competitors in football and basketball. The US and India, both British colonies once, were introduced to cricket by the colonists. But while the sport gained a cult-like status in India, it died a slow death in the US. In his paper 'The fate of cricket in the United States: Revisited', author George Kirsch wrote that cricket could not gain prominence in the US as it closely resembled a well-established rival indigenous sport -- baseball. While sports such as tennis and golf thrived since they did not have a direct rival, cricket suffered due to its similarities with baseball. However, in India and other British colonies, cricket did not face competition from any native premodern team sport, noted Kirsch. Moreover, while American nationalism detested cricket for its colonial association, Indian nationalism saw the sport as a non-violent tool to beat the British at their own game. \"In India, the nationalist movement from the close of the nineteenth century made it imperative that cricket be taken up as a non-violent means to compete with the ruling British. In the United States, where independence was achieved a century and a half earlier than India, this need was totally irrelevant,\" note Majumdar and Brown in their paper 'Why baseball, why cricket? Differing nationalisms, differing challenges. Reminded of the Amir Khan-starrer Lagaan? In recent years, cricket has experienced a modest resurgence in the US, driven largely by immigration from cricket-loving nations such as India, Pakistan, the Caribbean. The formation of the United States of America Cricket Association (USACA) and its subsequent reorganisation into USA Cricket has sought to revive and promote the sport at both the grassroots and professional levels. USA's Saurabh Netravalkar celebrates after dismissing India's Virat Kohli during the ICC men's Twenty20 World Cup 2024 Group A match. Netravalkar, an Indian-origin Oracle engineer, has emerged as one of the prominent performers in the tournament. (Photo: AFP) The establishment of Major League Cricket (MLC), with its inaugural season launched in 2023, marked a significant milestone in the effort to re-establish cricket in the American sports landscape. The second season of the MLC will begin shortly after the T20 World Cup and will see the participation of many high-profile cricketers, including Australian skipper Pat Cummins. Cricket has returned to the US in a shorter, sharper, more entertaining form. For cricket, there is a long way to go for it to be among the major sports in the US. The T20 World Cup, in which Team USA has managed to reach the Super 8 stage, is just the beginning. While the sport still remains popular mostly among immigrants from Southeast Asia, it could see a deeper penetration as the T20 format is more about the masses than classes."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story It's a happy teachers' day for many but not all. For a few, and there are quite few of them, for whom being a 'teacher' defined everything they could never become. Where they were pigeonholed into set stereotyped roles which were acceptable as - ideal job for women. A job of convenience for others, for women who were ambitious and career oriented. In the swathe of our massive 'moralistic' middle class, a career option deemed suitable for a woman because it was and is seen to be less demanding with shorter hours and by that sheer virtue, more compatible with household and child care responsibilities. The result of that career choice has not just impacted so many women who culled their career dreams for the only option available. The impact of it has been cascading on the basic 'tenets' of education. Where children were taught by women who were never quite interested in the job of an educator. If I was to look back from my 1st grade till my 12th, and especially in my early primary years, nearly all my teachers have been women. In my entire schooling years, I can count three male teachers who taught me - my physical education teacher, French teacher and my accounts teacher. Not to be disrespectful, but mostly my teachers were either bored army housewives or women who just were not interested in the job of teaching. I will say there were a few for whom the real calling was education, they flourished and so did their pupils. There were also those very few, who might not have wanted to be a teacher but did justice to the saying, 'It's not about the cards you are dealt but how you play the hand', which brings me to my English teacher. ALSO READ | How Savitribai Phule, India's first female teacher, dealt with abusers hell bent on preventing her from educating girls When I was in my third grade my much-adored English teacher asked us what we wanted to become once we grew up. The answers were as varied as the imagination of a seven-year-old. From firemen to doctors, to Amitabh Bachchan to the prime minister to the enviable job of an ice cream seller, all echoed in a classroom peppered with peals of young laughter. When my turn came, I promptly said, \"A teacher just like you.\" As little that I was, little did I know I had touched a raw nerve. I would know exactly why over many a-conversations spread over the next nine years till I would pass out from Class 12th. At the time, my teacher smiled at me and asked why I wanted to be a teacher. She further cited many other career options for me to pick from. We settled on that I should think about it and get back to her. I never did get back to her on my choice of career, but over the years when she recommended and sometimes gifted many books that I read with glee, I did find out that my fabulous English teacher always wanted to be an air hostess. A career option that her army General father looked down on and her army Major husband chided her off. In any case an army wife is an army wife first before a career woman and no one will know this better but an army wife... even today. ALSO READ | Education gender bender: Why do we see more female teachers in Indian schools? It is but rather evident that women are over represented in the education sector, it's something we have never questioned or really thought about. At the level of government policy when it was decided to increase enrolment of girls in school, it was decided that there be at least one female teacher in every primary school. To further this goal, many teacher training centres were set up exclusively for women. Women teachers were given incentives. This should have been great incentive to women who truly wanted to teach, but in addition to government policies, societal patriarchal compulsions slug the albatross around the neck of most women who wanted a career. For the rest of the women, it was a rather comfortable option that combined paid work with household work. It meant shorter work hours that coincided with their children's school, so they were back with the kids to pick up the household chores they started in the morning. It meant long vacations that again coincided with the kids' vacations. It meant that the husband would never have to 'adjust' or work around her work hours. The piece all so perfectly fit in the big middle class patriarchal puzzle. As per the data from the education department, more than 80% of all teachers in kindergarten through high school are women. The gender imbalance is glaring in elementary and middle schools, where more than two-thirds of teachers are women. What's more is that the pay scale is mostly gender skewed in favour of male teachers. According to the Unified District Information on School Education (U-DISE) report 2019-2020, at the pre-primary level, there were over one lakh women teachers, while the count for male teachers remained just 27,000. At the primary level, 35.44 lakh teachers were recorded. Of these, 19.68 were female and 15.76 were male. There are two ways to look at the glut of women teachers in India - one we subscribe to the over used cliche of 'naari shakti' and herald it as sign of women empowerment without reading the fine print. The other option is we recognise the subtle stereotypes enforced and celebrated over decades in India... we recognise the woman behind the 'teacher' and her aspirations. ALSO READ | Female teachers can do away with 'Ms' or 'Mrs' before names, thanks to campaign by BHU women's college teacher A good example here is Savitribai Phule, the first female teacher of India. She was a feminist, a social reformer who worked for the abolishment of the caste system, a philanthropist, an anti-infanticide activist, and she was a poet too. Savitribai Phule became a teacher in a sea of male educators, she didn't just push the envelope she tipped it off the table, she became what she wanted to not what she was supposed to. As we draft our emotion laden teachers' day messages maybe pay Savitribai Phule, a tribute long overdue. She blazed through creating a space for all women teachers, she wasn't easy with status quo... Should we be?"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story For an agnostic, blind faith fascinates me. More so when I travel though the rural crevices of India, where forget about divinity, even basic justice seldom reaches. The more I have traveled through rural India the more I have understood the true essence of 'Ram bharose'. The customary greeting of \"Ram Ram\" is often steeped in the belief that it's all up to him and no one else. Primarily because there is no one else and those in the villages know it best that it's all Ram bharose. The rural health infrastructure of our country pays the fittest tribute do that old adage of Ram bharose. Before I get to the pandemic which bridged the rural-urban divide far better than anything else could, I want to talk about the 'mystery fever' that has killed at least a hundred across Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The fact that at least 50 of those who died were kids is a side note that might temporary shock the urban dwellers but for the rural record books, it's a routine statistic during flu/viral/encephalitis/mystery fever season. It was around August 18 that news started to filter in of sickness in the hinterlands of Uttar Pradesh. A wave of mystery fever was sweeping the rural heartland of the state. Small towns and villages around them were mostly in its grip. The epicentre was Firozabad. Hundreds were falling sick, many were dying. As days went by, the cases rose. What was highly troubling was the fatality rate among children. The import of young kids dying of the fever raised an alarm. What could authorities do? This was after all a mystery fever that had come calling after a deadly pandemic. Days turned to weeks and the numbers of dead and infected rose to hundreds and thousands respectively. Neighbouring state Bihar was also now in the grips of this fatal fever. Reports of the sick and dead from many areas started to filter in. The intense fever was sweeping through the two states. In Uttar Pradesh most children who passed away had symptoms of high fever, dehydration sudden drop in platelet count. Two weeks later, as the fatalities rose yet the Indian health authorities remained confounded as to what this mystery illness was. The national media picked it. The news made it to international publications. It was then the authorities finally solved the mystery of the debilitating illness at-least two weeks after it was reported. It was not one but two diseases - one caused by a bacterium and the other a virus. What had foxed authorities for weeks was scrub typhus and dengue. Not any mystery illness but two well-versed easily diagnosed diseases. Yet, we have lost at least a hundred people including more than 50 kids with thousands sick. Kids died like flies because in many cases platelets count was never done. Something that could have easily been avoided but wasn't because when it comes to the rural heartland it's all Ram bharose. It now brings me to how the pandemic silently ravaged through rural India. If urban India was about desperate tweets screaming for help, then rural India's angst and desperation were eerily displayed by floating bodies in the Ganga. Shallow graves around rivers laid testimony to the shallow promise of equity. Village after village I saw many hooked onto IVs (intravenous intubation) from trees being injected by quacks. A vivid memory from eastern Uttar Pradesh during the brutal second wave is that of a halwai's shop on top a hardware basement store in Ghazipur. Both had been turned into a make shift hospitals run by unqualified 'jholachaps'. The problem was not as much as the free-run of these quacks but the fact that most villagers preferred seeking treatment from them to even setting foot in a government-run unit. Here, the promise of 'private' was found way safer than a government hospital. Nothing can be a more honest testimony to the state of our rural health infrastructure than that someone trusts a phoney with their life over a possible doctor at a government ward. The disparity between rural and urban India has always been stark. Even though urban India suffers from massive shortcoming in comparison to its rural sibling, it's in far better stead. While urban India takes the lion share of facilities, rural India is but left Ram bharose. According to World Bank data, more than 65 per cent of India lives in rural areas. Yet, hospitals in rural areas have just 37 per cent of the beds available in all government hospitals across the country. According to the World Bank, in 2017 India had only 0.5 beds per 1,000 people, far below the global average of 2.9 beds. No surprises that the rural healthcare infrastructure is in tatters. According to the Rural Health Statistics (RHS 2019-20), there are 1,55,404 rural Sub-Centres (SC), 24,918 Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and 5,183 Community Health Centres (CHCs). As per the same data, there is a shortfall of 18 per cent SCs, 22 per cent PHCs and 30 per cent CHCs. What is worse is the inaccessibility to these centres, and how these centres are crumbling, ill-equipped and mostly shut. The second wave of Covid-19 pandemic underlined all of the above, where all these inadequacies were exposed. Travelling through several districts in Uttar Pradesh, I never saw a PHC which was open or a CHC which was equipped to deal with even a basic illness leave alone a pandemic. The government hospitals in the smaller cities are a nightmare. The way to understand how bad a nightmare is to walk into emergency or the general ward of one. India's public health expenditure has remained between 1.2 per cent and 1.8 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product) between 2008-09 and 2019-21. Let's compare this with health expenditure done in other countries such as China (3.2 per cent), the US (8.5 per cent) and Germany (9.4 per cent). Let's now also look at another figure in the mix. The allocations for the rural component (under the National Rural Health Mission) have been decreased by three per cent since last year. As of 2018, there was a deficit of 46 per cent of doctors, and 82 per cent of specialists including surgeons, gynaecologists and paediatricians required in the PHCs across India. Primary Health Centres (PHCs) were primarily made by the states to facilitate rural health care. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends 44 health workers per 10,000 people but India has only 22 health workers for every 10,000 persons. Rural areas have lower health worker density than the national average. India has a doctor-population ratio of 1:1445. The WHO recommends a ratio of 1:1000. The doctor-population ratio in rural India is appalling; a small example - the doctor-population ratio in Bihar is 1:28,391. The heath infrastructure statistics of rural India are always shocking. Sadly, the collateral it extracts from rural India has always been nothing more than a statistic in itself invoking zero empathy. Accepted as something that happens in the hinterland, afterall, it's a land where everything including 'god' is 'Ram bharose'.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story This one is tricky, as it speaks on the legend of India's Holy Grail. No, not just a legend but a saint, taught to us as an undisputed, all-inclusive historical icon of non-violence. The Father of the Nation. To criticise his legacy is to criticise the very core of Indian ethos; to question him is worse. Worse still is to refer to him as Gandhi and not Gandhiji. Even the far 'right' accused of being linked to his assassination will never say a word against Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. So, why in the world do I want to be trolled by Left, Right and Centre, along with some new-age 'wokes' thrown in? Well, because he was seemingly being credited for something he simply wasn't - a feminist. But why am I talking about him now? At a Mahila Congress event, Rahul Gandhi said, \"When one saw pictures of Gandhi, one saw many women with him. When one sees pictures of RSS leader Mohan Bhagwat, one doesn't see any woman as the RSS ideology is anti-women.\" ALSO READ | Gandhi visited Shakha in 1947, applauded RSS workers' absense of divisive feelings: Mohan Bhagwat In the physicality of the pictures, yes. But in essence and actuality, Rahul Gandhi was incorrect. I learnt it the hard way, indoctrinated since childhood to accord saint-like status to Mahatma Gandhi. In college, I was affronted with a few facts that were never quite told to me. Disbelief, denial and acceptance -- the usual trajectory to shock followed. Coming back to what Rahul Gandhi said. The RSS, with its core ideology, has been anti-women. Definitely no champion of women's rights, rather far from it, but neither was Gandhi. No, he was no flag bearer of equal rights. More so, certain facets of his personality were extremely troubling, unforgivable and importantly indefensible. ALSO READ | Gandhi can't be father of nation where people are lynched, says artist The women that he was often pictured with in his late 70s were Manuben, Sushila Nayar and Abha. Which brings me to the unforgivable facet of his personality, his experiments with celibacy. I know I'm on thin ice; this would be deemed deviant and criminal. These highly controversial celibacy experiments began after Gandhi's wife Kasturba Gandhi had passed away. Manu, the daughter of Gandhi's nephew, having lost her mother, was brought up by Gandhi and his wife Kasturba Gandhi. In the mid-1940s, to test his vow of celibacy, Gandhi, in his mid-70s, asked his 19-year-old great-niece Manu to sleep in his bed naked. Manu, for the record, despite the unequal power equation between her and her great-uncle, never complained. Gandhi went on to include Abha, his great-nephew Kanu Gandhi's wife and his personal physician Sushila Nayar in these experiments. There is also enough evidence to corroborate that there were many more. At the time, many did express disapproval over this behaviour. His stenographer RP Parasuram left his ashram when Gandhi refused to stop these \"experiments.\" Two editors of his newspaper refused to print his sermons on these unusual sleeping arrangements and resigned. ALSO READ | Newly discovered diaries of Gandhi's personal attendant reveal how his experiments with celibacy changed her life Nehru, in his autobiography, described Gandhi's idea of celibacy as abnormal and unnatural and said, \"His advice may fit in some cases, but as a general policy, it can only lead to frustration, inhibition, neurosis, and all manner of physical and nervous ills I do not know why he is obsessed with this problem of sex.\" Sardar Patel, in a letter to Gandhi in 1947, expressed his disgust over the experiments. To quote his biographer, historian Ramchandra Guha, \"Gandhi was also obsessed with his own sexuality and celibacy, which is hugely problematic. He was doing these experiments to test his celibacy. He wanted to make sure he was not a sexual predator. Those experiments cannot be defended. They were an imposition on young people and an exercise in power, because he is the great Mahatma and she's just a young follower.\" How would Gandhi's celibacy test be seen by the world today? For Gandhi, this was his pious plea of chastity, but it would have been criminal not just in the #metoo era but much before it. ALSO READ | Gandhi's enemies While we are talking of women's rights and Gandhi's take on celibacy, it's unclear if he asked his wife Kasturba before he took the vow of celibacy. In 1906, Gandhi took a vow to practice celibacy. In his own words, \"I had not shared my thoughts with my wife until then, but only consulted her at the time of taking the vow. She had no objections.\" In many interviews, he has made it vehemently clear that he believed women did not have sexual desire and that it was the preserve of men. Celibacy was one of the 11 vows taken by his ashram inmates, even married couples. On a number of occasions, he forbade his disciples to marry. They were encouraged to sleep naked with each other but refrain from sex. Gandhi's views on rape were disconcerting, to say the least. He wrote, \"I have always held that it is physically impossible to violate a woman against her will. The outrage takes place only when she gives way to fear or does not realise her moral strength. If she cannot meet the assailant's physical might, her purity will give her the strength to die before he succeeds in violating her It is my firm conviction that a fearless woman, who knows that her purity is her best shield, can never be dishonored. However beastly the man, he will bow in shame before the flame of her dazzling purity.\" ALSO READ | Let the world say whatever it wants, says Manuben Another incident that seemed to put the onus of sexual harassment on women. He wrote that when he was still in South Africa, he found that a man had been harassing his female followers. He reportedly personally cut the girls' hair to \"ward off\" unnecessary attention. While many laud him to be one who gave women prominent positions in the Congress party and championed education for women, he ultimately did believe that home and children were women's primary responsibility. Mirroring what most men feel today women can go thus far and no more. On women and modern dressing, He wrote to Manu Gandhi, \"What a pity that the modern girl attaches greater importance to following the code of fashion than to the protection of her health and strength.\" As Gandhi slowly turned into Mahatma and marketed to a global audience as a beacon of ahimsa which he was, much of the unflattering damaging facts were less talked about. Even now, to touch upon the shortcomings of Gandhi is blasphemous. A small example. When the news broke on Rahul Gandhi invoking Mahatma Gandhi as the champion of women's rights, a highly explosive debate raged on in my newsroom. Nearly all experienced, stellar editors, with many years under their belt to be able to teach me a thing or two about journalism, were quick to defend Gandhi with \"a man who had his faults\" or it takes immense greatness to be able to admit and write about one's own failings on their own, which Gandhi did. I find myself a little ashamed to say this about the father of my nation, but to me, despite a wealth of good that he did for India, and there is so much of that, but a man in his 70s who invites girls in their teens to sleep with him naked to test his celibacy might be a visionary, but he is a dirty old man. None of the women complained, but what would have been the power equations when the request to strip came from the Mahatma himself? So, can I allow Gandhi a free pass with the \"the times they lived in were different\" excuse? No, I can't. Can I disregard his legacy no matter how flawed? No, I can't. Can I reject his every revolutionary thought on a non-violent revolution, western hegemony, rural economy (and I can go on here)? No, I can't. But can I say he was no Mahatma, far from it? Yes, I will."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story And another one bites the dust. The house of Sabyasachi has also yielded. Under heavy online trolling, a legal lawsuit clubbed with a high political pitch, the fashion house of Sabyasachi has pulled down its latest ad campaign. The fashion designer was in the eye of a right wing storm for a campaign that allegedly insulted the Hindu symbol of marriage -- the mangalsutra. A symbol that many 'modern' Indian women have deep reservations over is the topic for another opinion piece. All it took was an ad campaign where the 'sacred' flirted with the sensual -- the mangalsutra resting on a partially exposed heavy bosom and the skin that was getting thinner by the day of the proud nationalist Hindu was pricked. Most of the distress was felt by strident Hindu men. However, I admit there is a rising brand of 'proud Hindu' women found in copious capacity on the internet whose honour gets threatened quite often. So, it was a clear affront that creative liberties were taken with the 'suhag ki nishani' or the pious thread of matrimony. OPINION | Mark Zuckerberg is chasing metaverse dream but it's a dystopia and not utopia The ad campaign very quickly went viral, albeit for the wrong reasons. Sabyasachi's new collection, titled \"Intimate Fine Jewellery\", featured models flaunting the fashion house's newly launched mangalsutra. Heterosexual and same-sex couples posed wearing The Royal Bengal mangalsutra, which is a part of the designer’s intimate jewellery collection. These photos also feature models dressed in intimate apparel wearing a mangalsutra. One particular picture that was brutally trolled was of a dark-skinned, voluptuous model wearing a mangalsutra and resting her head on a bare-chested man. Exceptional offence seemed to have been taken over this picture with many calling it obscene, and even pornographic. A flood of tweets on how Hindu culture was insulted by women in intimate wear made Sabyasachi's 'asabhya' ad the top Twitter trend and what it also did was pave the way for mainstream players (read not fringe) to jump in once again as saviors of Hindu traditions. Enter - Narottam Mishra, Home Minister of Madhya Pradesh. Designer Sabyasachi was served a warning by Mishra, who gave the fashion house 24 hours to pull down its campaign. Under pressure, Sabyasachi buckled and withdrew the ad campaign. OPINION | Ban India-Pakistan cricket matches till religion bows out However, should the land of Kamasutra be affronted by a mangalsutra that rests on partially exposed breasts? That's come to be quite a tricky question. One would think if a country is cool with defying eroticism at the Khajuraho temples, then a little bit of skin while sporting a mangalsutra would be alright. Not quite! The dichotomy of India's hypocrisy lies in its complex Indian society that is paradoxical, riddled with contradictions and currently going through a phase where the smallest thing can trigger its majoritarian ego. This in the backdrop of big corporates withdrawing ad campaigns after facing online and political heat. Dabur India Limited tendered an unconditional apology and withdrew its latest advertisement featuring a lesbian couple celebrating the Hindu festival of Karwa Chauth. The brand had come under heavy political and online fire for promoting lesbianism. CEAT came under attack, with its brand ambassador Amir Khan asking people, in what would seem sage advice, not to burst crackers on roads. The ad was given a communal religious twist of a Muslim advising Hindus to not burst crackers on Diwali and clamour grew to ban it. Ceat, till now, seems to have stood its ground with the ad campaign still in circulation. Before the outrage over Ceat, there was Fabindia. BJP youth leader Tejasvi Surya led the charge, calling for an economic boycott of the brand. Fabindia was forced to pull down its ad campaign owing to political and social media pressure for labeling their Diwali campaign Jashn-e-Riwaaz. Also, how dare the models not wear bindis while celebrating a Hindu festival? Those supporting this unprecedented backlash feel there is a concerted attack on Hindu traditions in popular culture, questioning why these ads are not made on other faiths but only \" target\" Hindu traditions. Others question the ethos of new India, where if you believe in a multicultural liberal society that promotes inclusivity, you will be silenced. It’s a woke versus right-winger battle. The word ‘woke’, which many struggled to understand, has quickly been mainstreamed. Not too many months ago, I remember trying to explain its meaning to my right-leaning 75-year-old paternal uncle, who, after hearing me, quickly dismissed it as the progeny of the older word \"liberal\". And like it’s mother ‘liberal’, ‘woke’ also seems to be fighting a tough battle, often dismissed, misconstrued, berated and sometimes even equated with being a cuss word. Considering all that 'woke' originally meant was to be alert to racial prejudices, discrimination and social inequalities. But these are strange times, where the mad fringe is now mainstream, ministers openly issue threats in the guise of guardians of the faith, social media has become super censor, leading to tangible consequences, where pulling back, submitting and letting a bully have his way seems to be the safest option. A time when the vicious normalising of bigotry is going unquestioned. A time when a ‘liberal’ would tell its offspring, \"You stay woke...this bigoted cloud will pass\"."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A motley crew of anarchists, Khalistanis, andolanjeevis, atankvadis, opposition parties with a smattering of farmers belonging to just two states of Punjab and Haryana have made the government take back three farm laws that were so damn good for the farmers. What a pity, right? You would believe this if you sat through television debates raging on prime time across many channels for a full one year. After all, every spokesperson of the government would come and tell us that those squatting on Delhi’s borders were not kisans but krantikaris or anarchists. So, what made the government yield to anarchists? It doesn’t need me saying this as the answer is pretty obvious: upcoming elections in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Uttarakhand. Days before election dates are announced, the country woke up to a massive announcement: the Prime Minister on the occasion of Gurpurab addressed the nation. While apologising to the farmers and the country, the prime minister said, and I quote, “ I want to say with a sincere and pure heart that perhaps there must have been some deficiency in our efforts, due to which we could not explain the truth like the light of the lamp to some farmers.” He went on to urge the farmers sitting on Delhi’s borders to go home now. This is the second occasion that the PM has backtracked on a reform he was set on. What is interesting is that both have involved farmers. If the first was the land acquisition law, this time it’s the farm laws. While the address was emotional and sincere, replete with an apology, it remains to be seen if this could be a balm on a wound so raw carried by a lot of protesting farmers. Questions will remain if it has come a tad too late. The agitation has now crossed a full year, and to say there has been a complete trust deficit between the government and farmers would be putting things mildly. The acrimony was made worse by what went down on January 26. What added to it was spokesperson after spokesperson, minister after minister calling the farmers Khalistanis, anarchists and opposition clad in farmers’ clothes. For a lot of those who watched TV debates avidly, it would be fun to watch government spokespersons tonight. While there are genuine concerns about the inability to enforce reforms in India, and it is a fact that the farm sector is crying out for reforms, the end result of what we have seen transpire for a year now gives credence to the question: can reforms happen by stealth in a democracy? But then there is this beauty to a democracy. It turns regular farmers into andolanjeevis and regular politicians into chunavjeevis, all in a year’s time. And now the government will clean the egg on its face with what it hopes will be dividends of an electoral trade-off in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. The farmers that stood united on two borders now seem divided by the announcement, something that could be a preview of the coming two elections in UP and Punjab. Jalebis are being distributed at the Ghazipur border between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, while cynicism is still apparent at the Singhu border between Delhi and Punjab. How much the taking back of the farm laws and an apology by the Prime Minister will impact the coming elections, time will tell. But for now, the hinterland is booming with just one narrative: to say it in colloquial Haryanvi, Bhai, kisaan ne sarkar ke godde tika diye. (the farmers have brought the government to its knees).

I pray at home.. We are all Hindus.\" In response to the question about 'lal topi khatre ki ghanti' (red cap is a warning bell), Yadav said, \"Laal topi BJP ke liye khatre ki ghanti hai (the red cap is a warning bell for BJP).. People want a yogya sarkar (capable government) not a 'yogi sarkar'. The double engines are crashing into each other in UP.\" He reiterated his stand to not align with Congress or AIMIM. \"We will never align with Congress again. It was a terrible experience in 2017. Will not tie up with Owaisi. No more alliances, my house is full,\" he said."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Yes, the term 'Rashtrapatni' is downright sexist, but let’s be under no illusion that 'Rashtrapati' wasn’t coined with the assumption that a woman will or could not hold India’s highest constitutional post! Simply put, how would one address the President of India in Hindi, if she happens to be a woman? Rashtrapati? The standard title for the President in India is the Hindi word 'Rashtrapati'. However, 'pati' translates to 'husband' , which is seemingly at odds with a woman elected to that title. Usually, in India, even with its 1.4 billion population, it's not been an issue as only two women have been elected to the post so far. Of this, the second one occupied the Office of President recently, on July 25, 2022. President Droupadi Murmu has officially taken over as the President of India, becoming not only the second woman to hold the largely ceremonial yet the highest constitutional post in the country, but she is also the first from a tribal community to hold the post. Once again leading a few, largely those concerned with women's rights and gender equality, to ask a deceptively simple question -- is Rashtrapati a gender-neutral title? The first time the need for bias-free titles raised in recent memory was when India elected its first woman president, Ms Pratibha Patil, in 2007. The nomination of a woman for the first time to the top constitutional post led to a dilemma especially amongst the media as to how to address Madam President in Hindi? I remember anchoring shows then, where constitutional experts maintained not much should be made of the nomenclature of the title and she should continue to be called Rashtrapati, as it is a constitutional post, it remains gender neutral. Before becoming the president, Patil was also the deputy chairperson of Rajya Sabha, where she was addressed as Upsabha-pati in Hindi. Moreover, if a governor can be used in a neutral form, why not the President? Yes, it can be used in a neutral form for sure, but is it truly gender neutral? What it is, is a gender-biased word. The sheer virtue of it being used for decades as a constitutional title does not make it neutral. Would it be socially acceptable for a man to occupy a post where the title had a suffix of 'patni' ? There is another argument by Hindi linguistic academics made at the time of Pratibha Patil that the word 'pati' didn't literally mean husband but meant a 'custodian'. But the genesis of 'pati' being related to a custodian lies in what the term 'husband' meant -- the Sanskrit compound of master/lord/swami /ruler. One could think of it as quite sexist. Incidentally, how to address a President was a moot point even in the Constituent Assembly in 1947. Members K T Shah and Sri Gokul Bhai Dutt had suggested that a woman President could be called “Neta” and one suggestion was “Karnadhar (captain)”. Then a committee was also formed to deliberate on the issue and file a written submission. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru rejected the suggestions and finalised on “Rashtrapati” . During the freedom movement, Congress presidents were addressed as “rashtrapati”. So began the constitutional tradition of addressing the President as Rashtrapati. Until there was a woman elected to the post, decades of use had cemented the constitutionality of the title as 'gender-neutral'. The pushback in 2007 at the time of Ms Patil, and even now at the time of President Murmu, has been mostly from women's rights activists. I remember former NCW chief Ranjana Kumari in 2007 had written to the PM to address what seemed like a patriarchal title for a woman to hold. Gender rights activists at that time had called for a nationwide debate on whether the title needed to be changed. That debate never happened in 2007. 15 years later, India has a new Rashtrapati , and she is a woman."

The operational goal for the Opposition meeting is said to ensure a common candidate against the BJP in at least 450 seats already identified by Nitish as potential locations to beat the saffron party in the Lok Sabha polls.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who recently retired as a judge of the Supreme Court, said that he is troubled by the way bail jurisprudence is being handled. In an exclusive conversation with India Today TV, the retired judge said he felt there’s a problem that the custody period cannot be substituted for conviction. \"It can’t be that we may or may not get a conviction, so let's keep the person behind bars. So the entire objective of keeping a person under custody is to prepare a case within legal parameters, so you get all the material, he doesn’t try to influence the trial etc. But it can’t be a prolonged affair,\" Justice Kaul said. According to him, if the trial goes on, the person must get bail, and jail being the rule and bail being an exception is not the correct position. \"You are depriving his right. Tomorrow if you don’t get a conviction, how do you compensate him for the period he was in custody? So this whole culture of change, are we evolving? That jail is the rule and bail is an exception? I don’t believe that’s the correct position,\" Justice Kaul underlined. Responding to a question about whether it’s disconcerting that denial of bail is becoming the rule of thumb in courts, Justice Kaul said that he doesn’t know why the signals sent by the top court through its judgements still haven’t gone down to what the court expected. He added that according to him, denying bail is intellectual dishonesty and that any man deserves bail. \"I don’t know why signals we have sent through various judgements still have not gone down to what we expected them to be. I can only hope the courts realise. At the judicial academy, I used to say if you think giving dishonest bail is wrong, denial of bail is intellectual dishonesty, if you feel a man deserves bail,\" Justice Kaul said. Further, referring to investigating agencies like the CBI and the ED, Justice Kaul said that these are premier investigating agencies, and their work has to be of the highest order. In cases of economic offences, Justice Kaul said it can be the case that trials don’t go on or get delayed, and the person is kept behind bars. If the person is seeking unnecessary adjournments, which is a challenge the prosecution claims to face, then the court should control those proceedings, he said. \"...And send them behind bars, but they should be given a chance to defend themselves,\" the retired Supreme Court judge told India Today TV. Justice SK Kaul said he was not keen on heading for a government post after his retirement. He said it did not fit his scheme of thought process for what he should do and said that he would like to live a private life post-retirement. When asked about judges taking government appointments after retirement, and whether there should be a period to cool off, Justice Kaul said it was an individual’s call. \"The constitutional position of a judge should be able to take his call on what is proper. There are judicial posts that I don’t want to take, someone else might, which is his/her call,\" Justice Kaul said. Justice Kaul said he would like to spend time with his family, wishes to travel in the country and outside, concentrate on health and spend more time in Kashmir where he belongs."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In an interview with India Today TV, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who recently retired from the Supreme Court, emphasised that the judiciary serves as the conscience keeper of the Constitution, and not of the Opposition or the government. Justice Kaul further added that courts are to adjudicate legal issues and political nuances must be debated in political space. Justice Kaul addressed the influx of political cases brought before the Supreme Court and highlighted the impact of these political cases on the court's schedule. He expressed concern that they divert attention from cases where litigants have been waiting for resolution for many years. \"In a way, it's taking away time from ‘Ramlal vs Shyamlal' matter. Poor chap whose case has been pending for 13-14 years, he doesn’t get the result of his small dispute. My belief is those cases also need to be addressed,” he said. Justice Kaul urged against bringing political battles into the court , not in terms of adjudication but in recognising that some issues are better suited for political debate. Regarding the current political landscape, Justice Kaul acknowledged the strength of the present government but emphasised that the opposition must engage in the necessary fight. “Sometimes one government is strong, sometimes there are balance governments of opposition. Today, we undoubtedly have a strong government at the helm of affairs. But the solution is- the Opposition has to fight,” Justice Kaul said. Justice Kaul clarified that while the judiciary is a conscience keeper, it is the conscience keeper of the Constitution and not of the opposition or government. He emphasised that the court's role is to address legal aspects, and political nuances should be debated in the political space. “When I say we can’t play the role of the Opposition, I mean in areas which are not debatable in court; the more political nuances must be debated in political space. legal aspects will be debated in courts only and courts can’t shy away from taking a call on those. That is the job of the courts. Unfortunately, our job is such that we are bound to displease somebody or the other,” Justice Kaul said He added, “Maybe in terms of a weak opposition, sometimes the expectation is we will extend ourselves beyond a certain level. But we can’t extend ourselves beyond what we do.” When asked about the three criminal laws brought in by the government, Justice Kaul said that implementation is a critical issue in such cases. He emphasised the importance of well-drafted laws to minimise litigation and suggested the need for judicial and legal impact studies to anticipate the effects of new laws on litigation. “I’ve not applied my mind to it. I believe implementation is the bigger issue. Law must be well-drafted, not well-drafted laws generate a lot of litigation. Some laws, even earlier were well-drafted, like Evidence Act. I’m told a lot is incorporated in the new act,” Justice Kaul said. He further added that he has often emphasised that there should be judicial impact study and legal impact study to see how much more litigation the new laws will lead to. ‘If you do that, you can create infrastructure. Often, that is not done. And in some case, the oldest example being of the Cheque bounce cases, it generated a huge amount of litigation and the purpose it was supposed to serve didn’t get served,” Justice Kaul said. In response to questions about his previous statement advocating boldness in judges, Justice Kaul clarified that judges should not hesitate to provide relief where due. “We blame the Executive that they don’t take a call as they think they may face something; we have Constitutional protection, we shouldn’t hesitate to give relief where due. When I joined, this one judge told me that a litigant comes as a last resort to court, if he is entitled to 50 don’t give him 45,” Justice Kaul said. He said that judges are not revenue collectors for the government, adding that he had never been impressed when the government counsel mentioned the stakes involved in cases. With regard to his statement that intolerance is on the rise, Justice Kaul said, “Everyone wants to say something, but are you listening? You aren’t willing to listen to other's point of view.”"

The Mamata Banerjee-led party is of the opinion that the dominant party in the state should be allowed to take the final call on seat sharing, sources added. The seat-sharing number, as per sources, is based on a clear formula involving a look at parliamentary elections and a look at state assembly elections. The Trinamool Congress also reiterated their choice of Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge as INDIA bloc convenor . The Trinamool Congress sources said that while the party did not have anything against Nitish Kumar, it believed that Kharge would have a better impact as the Opposition alliance’s convenor. The Trinamool Congress believes that Kharge, who hails from the Dalit community, is the better option as he can influence 58 seats, sources said. During the recent meeting of the Opposition INDIA bloc , held last month in New Delhi, it was decided that the seat-sharing talks for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections should be finalised at the earliest. The Trinamool Congress had sought the seat-sharing details to be finalised by December 31, 2023. The deadline has since passed, with the INDIA bloc yet to arrive at consensus on seat-sharing."

Sources revealed that Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra initiated the conversation and spoke to Akhilesh Yadav after discussing the matter with Rahul Gandhi. The talks moved forward after the Congress gave up their demand for the Moradabad seat and instead asked for Sitapur, Shravasti, and Varanasi. \"All is well that ends well...there is no dispute...there will be an alliance,\" Akhilesh Yadav said when asked about his absence from Rahul Gandhi's 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' in Amethi and Rae Bareli. He had on Monday said that he would join Rahul Gandhi's yatra only after seat sharing was finalised . Congress is likely to contest in Amethi, Rae Bareli, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Maharajganj, Deoria, Bansgaon, Sitapur, Amroha, Bulandshahr, Ghaziabad, Kanpur, Jhansi, Barabanki, Fatehpur Sikri, Saharanpur, and Mathura seats. Both parties are likely to hold a joint press conference soon to formally announce the alliance.\\ On January 30, the Samajwadi Party announced its first list of candidates for 16 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh. On Monday, the party declared 11 candidates, and on Tuesday, it declared five candidates, fielding Akhilesh Yadav's uncle, Shivpal Yadav, from Budaun."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Trinamool Congress is likely to contest alone in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, hinted the party's Rajya Sabha MP Derek O'Brien on Friday. \"A few weeks ago, TMC Chairperson and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee stated that TMC is fighting all the 42 seats in Bengal. We are also in the fray in a few seats in Assam and the Tura Lok Sabha seat in Meghalaya. There is no change in this position,\" said Derek O’Brien. According to sources, there has been no communication between the Congress and TMC in the last couple of weeks regarding seat-sharing. Sources said if the Congress agrees to the TMC’s formula of two seats in Bengal for Congress (Maldaha Dakshin and Berhampore), one seat in Meghalaya for TMC (Tura) and two Bengali-dominated seats in Assam (out of four), then talks can resume and an alliance can be sealed. The earlier rift between Congress and the TMC had begun after the ruling party in Bengal reportedly denied the 'grand old party's' request for at least 8 to 10 seats. Last month, Mamata Banerjee declared that her party would contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections alone in the state. However, after the Congress and AAP agreed to seat-sharing , the TMC also changed its stance to renew talks with the Congress , sources said. The Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party (SP) and Congress also decided on a seat-sharing strategy for Uttar Pradesh. Congress will contest 17 Lok Sabha seats and the remaining 63 seats will be contested by the Samajwadi Party and other alliance partners of the INDIA bloc."

The party has also asked Maliwal to give her statement in connection with the matter, sources added. On Monday, May 13, Delhi Police received two successive calls, both originating from Kejriwal's residence, in which the caller, claiming to be Swati Maliwal, dialled the police after allegedly being assaulted by Kejriwal's aide, Bibhav Kumar . Later on Tuesday, party MP Sanjay Singh said that Kejriwal's personal assistant Bibhav Kumar had \"misbehaved\" with Maliwal at the Delhi CM's residence and that Kejriwal would take strict action in the matter. According to sources, Singh has also been tasked to mediate in the matter. Meanwhile, Maliwal has demanded strict action against Kumar in the matter. She has not yet filed a police complaint in the matter. A team of Delhi Police officials visited her house on Tuesday but declined to provide details. Meanwhile, the National Commission for Women (NCW) chief Rekha Sharma also expressed concern over the safety of Maliwal on Tuesday and asked her to speak up. The NCW chairperson wondered if Maliwal was under pressure not to complain to the police in the matter. \"I am worried about the safety of @SwatiJaiHind... what pressure is she under that she is unable to come forward and file a complaint with police. Be brave Swati #speakup,\" she said in a post on X."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story India’s bowling coach Paras Mhambrey lauded the star Indian batting duo Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma for their aggressive intent during the Super 8 fixture against Bangladesh in the T20 World Cup 2024. The duo got India off to a brisk start by adding 39 runs for the first wicket off 22 balls. Rohit scored 23 (11) with the help of three fours and a six, while Kohli registered his highest score of the tournament so far, scoring 37 (28) with the help of one four and three sixes. The Indian skipper got into the groove after facing just three balls in his innings as he collected back-to-back boundaries on the next two balls. On the other hand, Kohli also launched Shakib al Hasan for a maximum after facing just three balls in his innings. Following the aggressive approach by the star batters, Paras Mhambrey brushed away any doubts about their form and said that Rohit is playing his natural game which he’s continued from ODI World Cup 2023. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats “I think Virat has been - in the last, we’ve seen from the IPL itself and Rohit from the World Cup. I think both of them are in great form. I think every game there is a certain plan that you go in with. Sometimes some individual has to take a chance, the other has to play a defending role. So, I think that's going to happen out here, that's what is happening. Rohit is playing his natural game,” said Paras Mhambrey in the pre-match press conference ahead of the Australia game. ð¼ ððáðð£ððððá ðèððäð¬ ðð£ ð¼ð£ðéðððªð ððçðäðâ #ððððâðÄð£ððð ! ð ð A 5â£0â£-run win over Bangladesh for @ImRo45 & Co as they seal their 2ï¸â£nd win on the bounce in Super Eight. ð ð Scorecard â¶ï¸ https://t.co/QZIdeg3h22 #T20WorldCup | #INDvBAN pic.twitter.com/GJ4eZzDUaA — BCCI (@BCCI) June 22, 2024 Further speaking ahead, Mhambrey also lauded Kohli for his intent and said that’s the template set by the team management for everyone to follow. “But it's good to see that in this game especially, the intent that Virat has shown, I think that's good to see that, good to see that intent. And I think performance - you'll have games like this, you'll get a 40-odd, 50-odd run, but I think the way he went about with the intent, that was good to see. That was good heartening. And I think that's the intent that we want as a batting unit as well. Something that we've been emphasizing on throughout the previous World Cup, this World Cup as well,” he added. Notably, Kohli is having his worst campaign in the history of the T20 World Cup, having scored just 66 runs from five innings at an average of 13.20 and a strike rate of 108.19. The 35-year-old started the tournament with just five runs from the first three innings but has finally found some form with scores of 24 (24) and 37 (28) against Afghanistan and Bangladesh respectively. The most prolific batter in the history of the tournament and two-time Player of the Tournament winner (2014 and 2016), will be eager to notch up a big score in the upcoming clash against Australia as India prepare to knock out their nemesis from the tournament."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A cat trapped in between the grills of a 20-storey building in Chennai was saved as a dramatic video of its rescue mission went viral on Instagram. Blue Cross of India, an NGO based in the Tamil Nadu capital, posted the video as its team rescued the cat which was stuck in the grills of the building for over 12 hours. Residents of the apartment spotted the cat struggling for its life and promptly alerted the fire department as well as the Blue Cross of India team. Members of the Blue Cross of India, thereafter, rushed to the spot immediately and assessed the situation. “Accessing the grills was only possible through the building’s terrace. We sent the ropes down to reach the rescue spot. It was a very confined area and it was challenging to reach the point,” Blue Cross of India said in the post. The rescue team members managed to get inside the grills after wearing safety gear and finally pulled the cat out. “Our team saved a cat stuck in a 20-storey building’s grills! The cat was trapped for 12+ hours, but our experts rappelled down to rescue it! The daring operation was a success and the cat is safe back in its territory,” reads the caption of Blue Cross of India’s post. Watch the video here: A post shared by Blue Cross of India (@blue_cross_rescues) After watching the video, several social media users assumed that the cat had died, but that was not the case as Blue Cross of India soon addressed the concern: “Please note that the cat was sedated to ensure its safe removal from the grills, preventing potential falls or biting incidents. The sedation also protected our rescuer from any potential harm. Once the procedure was complete, the cat was released back to its territory after it fully recovered from the sedation.” Several others thanked the rescue team for saving the cat. “This was such a tough rescue. Imagine the height and that dingy place she was stuck in. Thank you so much, the brave man who went down to get the cat.” South actor Trisha Krishnan also commented on the video. Another user said, “This video gives me the hope that good human beings still exist. God bless them.” The Blue Cross of India (BCI), established in 1959, is an animal welfare charity based in Chennai."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Nutritionist Luke Coutinho urged restaurants and food delivery companies such as Swiggy and Zomato to deliver food in biodegradable non-plastic containers and thereby avoid using plastic. As a discussion ensued in the comments section of Luke’s post, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal responded by thanking the nutritionist for addressing the subject. In his post, Luke said that several restaurants have been using non-plastic containers as he stressed on the fact that hot food stored in plastic can make people sick. \"Swiggy, Zomato, Restaurants. Please work with your partners to ensure food deliveries happen in biodegradable non-plastic containers. Many restaurants do this already. Please make it uniform. Deliver food and health. Hot food in plastic is making people sicker. You’ll have the power to help make a change,” Luke said in his post. Take a look at Luke’s post here: Plastic containers are harmful for health due to several reasons related to chemical leaching and environmental impact. Many plastics contain chemicals like bisphenols and phthalates, which can leach into food and beverages, especially when exposed to heat or acidic conditions. Deepinder Goyal responded to Luke’s post, saying: “Thanks Luke for bringing this up. We will do what we can — will highlight restaurants which use food safe packaging, so customers can make a more conscious choice.” In a separate post, Luke also thanked Deepinder Goyal for acknowledging his concern. “A few days ago we realised this concern as it is impacting health in a huge way. Thank you @deepigoyal @zomato for acknowledging this and moving to action. At the end of the day, it’s about coming together with a vision to build a healthier country. Thank you. Me and my team are happy to help anytime,” Luke said in his post."

Whale sharks are known for their enormous size and peaceful nature as making any close interaction with them is a breathtaking experience. As seen in the video posted by Viral Hog, an incredible scene unfolded as the whale shark approached the diver and remained by his side for a long period, showing no signs of swimming away. The diver, thereafter, gently nudged the whale shark to ensure it doesn't inadvertently come into contact with his equipment. This unusual interaction highlights the gentle nature and curiosity of these majestic creatures in their natural habitat. Viral Hog said in the description of the video that, “This was filmed on a day when the whale shark was not at all afraid of people and constantly swam close to them, but most often to this diver. Perhaps because of the colour of his suit.\" Watch the video here: Thrilling, right? Whale sharks, found in all the tropical oceans of the world, feed on plankton and travel long distances to find food to sustain their huge size, and to reproduce."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A resident of New Delhi triggered a debate on X after he said in a now-viral post that Mumbai traffic gave him “middle-class trauma”. Bhaumik Gowande, an X user, said that he was “disgusted” after he landed at the Mumbai airport because the traffic in the Maharashtra capital was traumatic, in his experience. “Landing in Mumbai after living in New Delhi and just coming outside airport gives me the Third World Ick. God this city traffic really gives me middle class trauma. Disgusted (sic.),” Bhaumik said in his post. “I landed at 7: 15. I came outside the airport at 8: 04. It’s 8:44 and I’m ONLY 600m away from airport,” he added. His post has over 6 lakh views so far, and thousands of comments from people across the country, sharing their thoughts and opinions on it. No prizes for guessing that several Mumbai residents were rather irked by Bhaumik’s remark. Most others also flagged the dire situation of traffic in Bengaluru. “Go back to Delhi,” a comment on his post reads. Take a look at these conversations on his post: An X user also said, “Mumbai needs a lot more flyovers. It's a nightmare to be driving in Mumbai.” To this, Bhaumik replied: “Flyovers aren’t a solution for traffic.” Then this: One of the X users also schooled Bhaumik regarding his tone. Although Bhaumik has been responding to most of the comments on his post, this debate, most certainly will not end so soon. Hours after his post went viral, Bhaumik did clarify that he was born in Mumbai “in case people think I’m Delhiite.”"

In a Reddit post, the passenger shared three pictures from the flight as they said, “Flight to Leh got delayed due to bad weather, still sitting at the tarmac in Delhi.” One of the pictures featured a packet of snacks that IndiGo offered passengers on the flight amid the delay. The cabin crew also offered water to the passengers. “Appreciating IndiGo for running the AC, cabin crew constantly serving passengers with water and they handed us a small snack packet,” the passenger said in the post. The post sparked mixed reactions in the comments section as several users, unhappy with IndiGo’s service in the past , shared their experiences. “They cancelled the flight and made me beg when I was supposed to join my first job. That's when I decided I'll never fly with IndiGo again,” a comment reads. Another user said, “Now this is hospitality, compared to what has happened previously.” Several other social media users, though, applauded the airline for taking care of passengers amid the flight delay. “I have always appreciated the airline’s hygiene and cleanliness. It’s always been better. Though, they no longer greet passengers like they used to years ago.” Another user said, “Love IndiGo. They are way better than others.”"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A CEO based in the US state of Colorado was slammed online after he shared a post on LinkedIn detailing “what he learned after firing” his first employee. Matthew Baltzell, founder and CEO of Cap X Media, has gone viral after he recounted an employee’s exit that he said, “can either strengthen or weaken your company culture.” In his post, Matthew said that he began with a ten-minute meeting which was “short and direct.” This was followed by a severance package as he “gave one week’s pay for each year of work.” He “offered to provide a future job reference” and “stayed clear and honest”. “After the meeting, I sent a message over Slack to inform everyone that the employee was no longer with us, without giving details. Gossip doesn't help anyone. I provided the ex-employee's contact info to the team and encouraged them to reach out if they wished. This avoids any secrecy. This approach shows my team that if they ever have to leave, they'll be treated with respect, not discarded like trash. In the end, the ex-employee handled it professionally and with grace,” Matthew said in his post, which accompanied a picture of himself, all smiles. Several sections of the internet flagged his “lack of empathy” with respect to the situation and said, “Imagine being the fired employee, logging onto here and seeing your boss make a post like this about you. If that wasn’t bad enough there’s an accompanying photo of him SMILING about it.” Most of the users wondered why Matthew smiled in the picture that featured in his post: “Would you mind to tell us why this is a happy moment worth smiling and sharing?” His post left several users angry: “You just made someone’s exit incredibly problematic for yourself! zi would NEVER work for an individual that was so INSECURE about his own leadership that he had to share the semantics in his first firing experience! Grow up! Leaders don’t behave this way, you lose credibility in your philosophical beliefs and sound like a gossiping holier than thou brat!” Most importantly, this is what most users emphasised on: “This isn’t how leaders operate. I would take some time for serious self reflection, this is not a happy moment.” Some users, however, praised Matthew for his “approach” and said, “Firing someone is difficult. It’s best to keep it direct and transparent. Your approach is great.” Another comment reads, “Clear communication about circumstances is really necessary and not that common.” In his LinkedIn bio, Matthew Baltzell said that he posts about “real estate, online business, and audience building.”"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Artificial intelligence is everywhere. Whether we embrace it or fear it, there's no denying its pervasive presence in our daily lives. Chinese scientists and engineers are now taking AI to new heights. They are making AI-powered-sex robots. Imagine having a robot companion that not only looks real but can chat and respond to your touch, according to a report published by the South China Morning Post. A Shenzhen-based company called Starpery Technology, a leading producer of sex dolls, is at the forefront of this groundbreaking development. Evan Lee, Starpery's CEO, is thrilled about their latest project. \"We're developing a next-generation sex doll that can talk and interact physically with users. Our prototypes should be ready by August this year,\" he told South China Morning Post. Unlike traditional sex dolls that can only manage basic responses, these new models will be packed with advanced sensors and AI. This means they can move and talk, providing a much more engaging and lifelike experience. The goal is to create an emotional connection, making these AI companions far more than just tech toys. Despite the tough technical challenges, like making interactions feel genuinely human, Starpery is pushing forward to make this dream a reality. Building such advanced robots isn't a walk in the park. One major hurdle is battery capacity. Unlike electric cars, these robots don't have room for large batteries, so their energy density needs a boost. Another challenge is replicating the flexibility of human muscles. Current motors can't match the range of force and movement that human muscles can achieve. To make these dolls safer and more realistic, Starpery has been working on reducing their weight, the report mentions. By July 2023, they managed to slim down their 172cm (5 foot, 6 inch) tall doll to just 29kg, a big improvement from the previous 40kg. While these advancements are thrilling, they come with their own set of challenges. The cost of key components, like reducers that transfer power between the motor and the robot joints, makes affordability a major concern. These reducers alone account for 30 per cent of the robot's cost. Lee noted that Starpery aims to lower prices to make these realistic dolls accessible. Currently, their dolls are priced around $1,500, much cheaper than advanced models like Abyss Creations' Harmony doll, which starts at $6,000. Beyond affordability, there are ethical questions to consider. Critics argue that AI companions could blur ethical boundaries, reinforce harmful stereotypes, and reduce genuine human connections. The rapid pace of AI development also outstrips existing legal frameworks, creating uncertainty around their use and ownership. Despite these challenges, the future looks quite interesting. Starpery's roadmap includes developing robots that can do household chores, help people with disabilities, and provide aged care by 2025. By 2030, they envision robots protecting people from hazardous jobs. So, get ready to welcome a new kind of companion into your life—one that talks, moves, and maybe even feels a bit like love."

Dissatisfied, he posted a warning on social media, advising others to avoid ordering from Mehfil Biryani in Kukatpally. He also attempted to file a complaint on the Food Safety & Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) website but faced issues as the system demanded more information despite all necessary details being provided. Mehfil Biryani is owned by famous stand-up comedian Zakir Khan. Following the social media uproar, Swiggy’s customer care team eventually contacted Sai Teja and provided a full refund, addressing his grievances more satisfactorily.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story If you grew up in North India, you would remember gulping down glasses of shikanji or milkshakes with gond katira added to them during summer. You can even probably remember your grandmother telling you that it is healthy and keeps you cool. Summer of 2024 is all about gond katira (also called tragacanth gum) - at least on Instagram. The social media platform is suddenly loaded with Reels about this ‘summer superfood’ with influencers swearing by its long list of health benefits. Some videos suggest consuming it can give glowing skin, others say it helps relieve joint pain. Many promoted it as a solution for constipation. See some of the Reels here: A post shared by Vartika kanojia | Health |fitness |recipes (@myworldyoureye) A post shared by Thankam Kumaran (@useful_human_being) The odourless, translucent crystals turn into a dense gel after being soaked in water for a few hours. This gel is then added to lemon water, milkshakes or smoothies. Instagram may just have discovered this gum now but it has been a trusted herbal summer remedy in Indian homes for the longest time. Derived from the sap of the Astragalus tree, gond katira holds a revered place in Ayurvedic medicine due to its natural properties. Gond Katira swells up into a gel after being soaked in water for a few hours. (Photo: JioMart) But is it really as healthy as people claim it to be? Health experts say yes. Clinical nutritionist Lovneet Batra suggests consuming it for its cooling properties. “Gond katira is known for its cooling properties, making it an excellent natural remedy to reduce body heat during hot weather,” she tells India Today . Dr Vikas Jindal, consultant, department of gastroenterology at CK Birla Hospital, Delhi, says that it also helps control nose bleeding (a common occurrence during summer) owing to its cooling properties. Gond katira positively impacts the digestive system. It is rich in fibre and helps relieve constipation. Nutritionist Batra agrees and adds that “it acts a prebiotic and supports digestive health by promoting the growth of beneficial gut bacteria”. Dr Jindal, meanwhile, says it maintains hydration in our body. “It is used in both constipation and diarrhoea. If it is mixed with curd, it helps relieve diarrhoea. If you mix it with milk and then consume, it helps in constipation,” he says. Experts say gond katira is a boon for skin as well. While claims on social media that say it can totally eradicate acne might be far stretched, its hydrating properties aid in maintaining skin elasticity. A post shared by Akriti Bhardwaj (@theglobalistagirl) Dr Deepali Bhardwaj, a Delhi-based dermatologist, says it is packed with antioxidant properties and is hence good for the skin. “Because it contains antioxidants, it helps deal with issues like wrinkles and ageing. Also, it is not just summer-friendly but can also be consumed during winters,” she tells India Today . Nutritionist Lovneet agrees and says that it can help in treating acne, reducing wrinkles, and promoting a healthy glow due to its moisturising and healing properties. Health experts say it may help in reducing joint pain and inflammation because of its anti-inflammatory properties, making it beneficial for individuals with arthritis by offering pain relief. Dr Santosh Shetty, head department of orthopaedics and robotic joint replacement surgery, Surana Group of Hospitals, Mumbai, says that gond katira is beneficial for bones because it is rich in calcium and anti-inflammatory properties. “It contains calcium, which is essential for maintaining bone health and strength. Calcium is a key mineral that contributes to bone density,” Dr Shetty says. “It is believed to have anti-inflammatory properties, which could potentially help in reducing inflammation in bones and joints,” he adds. However, one should be careful about the quantity while consuming it. Additionally, experts suggest mixing the gond katira gel with water or milk instead of directly eating it. Lovneet says one should first soak gond katira (in crystal form) In water for 6-8 hours. “Consume one tablespoon gel mixed in cool fluid,” she says. According to experts, one should keep gond katira away from pregnant women, kids below age 5 and patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Women can consume it after pregnancy though. “Consuming gond katira is said to enhance physical strength and stamina. It is often used in traditional remedies to boost energy levels and improve overall vitality, especially in postpartum women,” says Lovneet. There are ample ways to add the goodness of gond katira to your diet. It has no taste, so you can mix it with flavoursome drinks and desserts. Just mix a spoonful of soaked gum into a glass of: You can also add it to your bowl of dessert like kheer."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A 33-year-old woman lost lakhs of money due to a fake parcel scam. She was an assistant professor from Udupi and has been swindled out of Rs 7.9 lakh by scammers posing as officials from FedEx and the Mumbai Police. The incident highlights the growing menace of sophisticated cyber scams preying on people who are not able to suspect fraud. Here is the full story. Namrata, the victim, received a call on June 22 from an individual claiming to be a FedEx employee named Sanjay Kumar. The caller informed her that a suspicious parcel addressed to her had been intercepted, TOI reported. The parcel allegedly contained five Iranian passports, five debit cards, two kilograms of clothing, and 150 grams of MDMA, a controlled substance. The caller escalated the situation by informing Namrata that an FIR had been filed against her with the Mumbai Police. In a state of panic, Namrata was connected to another fraudster posing as a Mumbai police officer. This individual, who identified himself as Pradeep Sawanth, advised her to either visit Mumbai or cooperate online. Given the convenience, Namrata chose the latter. The scammers asked Namrata to download the Skype app, where she received a video call from the purported police officer. During the call, they demanded sensitive personal information, including details from her Aadhaar card and bank debit cards. The fraudulent officer then convinced Namrata to transfer Rs 7.9 lakh under the guise of a pre-approved personal loan on a credit card, apparently for police verification purposes. Realising she had been duped, Namrata reported the incident to the authorities. A case has now been registered at the Manipal Police Station under sections 66(C) and 66(D) of the Information Technology Act, along with sections 419 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code, which pertain to cheating and impersonation. It is advisable to always verify the identity of the caller, especially if they claim to be from a government agency or a major company. It is better to use official contact details to confirm their legitimacy. One should also be aware of unsolicited calls or messages, especially those involving urgent actions or threats of legal consequences. Users should never share personal information like Aadhaar or bank details over the phone or online unless you are sure of the recipient's identity and need. People are also advised to avoid downloading unfamiliar apps or clicking on unknown links sent by strangers. If you suspect a scam, report it immediately to local authorities and the relevant financial institutions will try to prevent the loss. One of the best ways to avoid such scams is that one should stay informed about common and trendy scams that have been happening."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Four and a half billion years ago, our solar system was a swirling cloud of gas and dust around the sun, known as a protoplanetary disk. This cosmic nursery eventually condensed to form asteroids and planets. While astronomers can observe protoplanetary disks around distant stars, it is impossible to see what our own solar system looked like in its infancy. However, meteorites that have fallen to Earth provide valuable clues about the early solar system. In a recent paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , a team of planetary scientists from UCLA and Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory reported intriguing findings about the distribution of refractory metals in meteorites. These metals, such as iridium and platinum, typically condense at high temperatures and were expected to form close to the sun. Surprisingly, the study found that these metals were more abundant in meteorites from the outer disk, which was colder and farther from the sun. Formation of Jupiter created a gap in the disk, trapping the metals in the outer regions. (Photo: Getty) The researchers proposed that the early solar disk did not have a ring structure like those observed around other stars, such as HL Tau. Instead, it resembled a doughnut, allowing metal grains to migrate from the inner to the outer disk as it expanded. This migration posed a puzzle: gravity should have pulled these metals back into the sun. The team suggested that the formation of Jupiter created a gap in the disk, trapping the metals in the outer regions and preventing their inward migration. \"Once Jupiter formed, it very likely opened a physical gap that trapped the iridium and platinum metals in the outer disk and prevented them from falling into the sun,\" explained Bidong Zhang, a UCLA planetary scientist and the study's first author. \"These metals were later incorporated into asteroids that formed in the outer disk. This explains why meteorites formed in the outer disk have much higher iridium and platinum contents than their inner-disk peers.\" The study also highlighted the role of iron meteorites, which contain molybdenum isotopes pointing to various locations across the protoplanetary disk. These meteorites, older than any other rocks in the solar system, provide insights into the chemical composition of the early disk. Zhang and his collaborators have previously used iron meteorites to reconstruct the distribution of water in the protoplanetary disk. \"Iron meteorites are hidden gems. The more we learn about them, the more they unravel the mystery of our solar system’s birth,\" Zhang said. This research not only sheds light on the early solar system's structure but also raises new questions about the processes that shaped our cosmic neighbourhood."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Lok Sabha election results were full of shocks and surprises. The Bharatiya Janata Party, falling short of a majority, is now forming a coalition government with its allies. One burning issue that was repeatedly highlighted during the election campaign is now being voiced openly by ally Janata Dal (United). Nitish Kumar has demanded modifications to the Agnipath Scheme, launched two years ago to recruit soldiers in the armed forces. The JD(U) has asked the Narendra Modi government to seriously review the policy as it does not meet the aspirations of the youth. This scheme could therefore undergo a holistic review. What is the scheme? The Agnipath Scheme, launched in June 2022, has been called a transformational reform in the Armed Forces. It aimed to create employment opportunities for the youth (aged 17.5 to 21) to serve the nation as well as create a youthful profile in the armed forces. The scheme proposed to recruit 45,000 to 50,000 Agniveers every year (46,000 in both 2022 and 2023) with a scope for increment as per requirements. Those recruited would be trained in respective training centres and serve in the armed forces for four years. At the end of it, 25 per cent of the meritorious Agniveers would be retained while the rest would be let go with an exit package called “Seva Nidhi” — around Rs 12 lakh in severance and skill certificates, to help them in their second careers. During service, if an Agniveer dies on duty, his family is entitled to an insurance package of Rs 48 lakh and an ex gratia payment of Rs 44 lakh. The Centre also announced that it would help the 75 per cent who exit in their second careers, through vacancies in the Central Armed Police Forces and also in state governments; there are, however, no fixed quotas or guarantees yet. Where is the angst? The scheme has been severely criticised, mainly because recruitment in the armed forces, a very attractive employment option for the youth, especially in the rural areas of north India, suffered a setback. As it is, against a few hundred vacancies in the armed forces, lakhs of youth turn up at recruitment rallies. After finally getting recruited, if a bulk of them have to leave after four years with an uncertain future, there is a problem. The exit package of Rs 12 lakh, too, is grossly inadequate for starting a new business or career. Also, while there is a substantial one-time compensation of almost Rs 1 crore if an Agniveer dies on duty, there is no provision of pension to his family, as in the armed forces. What can be done? In principle, Agnipath is a progressive scheme, put into implementation after very long deliberations. It should not be shelved at the first voice of protest from allies in the new government. Also, the first batch of Agniveers has not yet passed out (scheduled for 2026-27) and therefore there has been adequate time to review and reform the scheme. Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh categorically stated in March this year that the government is not at all averse to taking any corrective steps to make this scheme attractive and sustainable for the youth of the nation. In that spirit, the first issue of concern is the percentage of retention. One quarter is extremely inadequate and needs to be reviewed. It also raises questions on the lengthy and laborious recruitment process: what is the point if after all the hard work, three-fourths of selected candidates are rejected? A fairer number would be in the range of 50-75 per cent, with the balance being side-stepped into alternate careers. To start with, 50-60 per cent retention with a provision to review it “upwardly only” after every five years, could be considered. The second issue is tenure. With almost 10 months in training and then induction and settling into respective units and battalions, an Agniveer gets little more than two years to showcase his skills and get hands-on experience. In this short time, how does the organisation judge and select the best 25 per cent? A minimum increase in tenure to five years, if not seven years, should therefore be considered. This would ensure that the Agniveer exiting gets the benefit of gratuity as well, which becomes applicable only after five years of service. Till the late 1960s, a similar recruitment scheme was in vogue in the armed forces, where a percentage of soldiers exited active service after seven years and remained as reservists for another eight years. The third issue is perhaps the most important: career assurance of the Agniveers exiting the scheme. Although the government has assured that 15-20 per cent will be absorbed in the CAPF and the state governments too will be encouraged to do the same, there are no fixed quotas yet. Maybe it is still in the works, but a lack of clarity is hurting the scheme and the aspiring youth. The CAPF, like the Border Security Force, the Central Industrial Security Force, the Central Reserve Police Force, the Assam Rifles, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, and the Sashastra Seema Bal, all come under the Union Home Ministry. Therefore, a clearly defined number could be earmarked for sidestepping of Agniveers in the CAPF every year. With the first batch of 46,000 Agniveers completing their four-year term in 2026-27, of whom 50 per cent could be retained (per possible modifications), it leaves 23,000 to be absorbed. This would imply an absorption rate of merely 2,000-3,000 in respective CAPF. Also, the exiting Agniveers should automatically get their “posting orders” to respective CAPF HQs, instead of them being made to run around applying individually, after exiting. This would majorly set to rest genuine concerns over future employment. It will also help the CAPF get fully trained and experienced personnel to augment their cadre. Plus, as the Agniveers in CAPF grow in service and rise through the ranks, they would have a better understanding to coordinate with the armed forces on the ground, whenever deployed alongside. Also, unlike the armed forces where soldiers start retiring at various ranks from the age of 35 onwards, the Agniveers sidestepped into the CAPF will get to serve till 60 years of age. Reform, not revoke Every scheme, when launched, has teething problems. The secret to success is to keep the mind open to constructive suggestions and reform it. The Agnipath Scheme needs time to fully develop. If the scheme evolves and becomes acceptable to all sections, it is a win-win situation for all. The armed forces will continue to attract the best talent, and the overall profile of the armed forces will become more youthful. The CAPF will get fully trained personnel to augment their cadre and most importantly, the career aspirations of youth will be met. We also need to remember that not all people recruited in any organisation continue to perform and remain productive as years go by. Therefore, if there is a system that keeps them on their toes and helps them maintain the overall productivity or output of the organisation, it can’t be called bad. The Agnipath Scheme has potential and therefore has no reason to be revoked if it is suitably reformed and refined.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Infertility has become a common problem for people across the globe. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), infertility is a disease of the male or female reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. There are several reasons causing infertility, which can be both male and female factors . Some causes are preventable. \"Infertility is high because people are now getting more aware. We were earlier taught that 30% of causes of infertility is because of the female reproductive system, 30% is male, and 30-40% is both. Now, the male infertility has crossed more than 50%,\" Dr KD Nayar, Chief Consultant and HOD at Akanksha IVF Centre, told IndiaToday.In. Dr Naveen Nishchal, Chairman & Founder of Voice Of Healthcare, at the National IVF Summit and Awards 2024 event said that the increase in infertility is because of an inactive lifestyle and unhealthy habits. \"Increase in infertility is attributable to our inactive lifestyle, stress, pollution , unhealthy habits, delayed parenthood and much more,\" said Dr Nishchal. There are several reasons causing infertility, which can be both male and female factors. (Photo: Getty Images) Dr Bindu Bajaj, Professor and HOD, Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Safdarjung Hospital, said that infertility needs to be given priority by the government , especially after it has been highlighted in the National Family Health Survey-5, showing that Sikkim had the lowest Total Fertility Rate (TFR). The doctors also highlighted growing health problems like endometriosis, PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome), male factors, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) have become reasons for infertility. With growing infertility issues among couples, in vitro fertilization (IVF) has become a prominent treatment option. However, since IVF is expensive, it is largely inaccessible to a majority of people in India. Dr Shweta Mittal Gupta, General Secretary, Indian Fertility Society, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital at the event, stressed that IVF should come under insurance to become acceptable, accessible and affordable to couples going through infertility."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The post-mortem report of Renukaswamy, a fan of popular Kannada actor Darshan Thoogudeepa, has revealed he was tortured with electric shocks before his death, police sources said on Monday. The development comes as authorities investigate the high-profile case that has shocked the Kannada film industry. Darshan and his actor friend Pavithra Gowda are among 17 people arrested in connection with Renukaswamy's murder. Police sources said a newly arrested suspect, Dhanraj, a cable worker from Mandya, revealed details about the torture. Dhanraj was allegedly called to a godown in Bengaluru by another accused, Nandish, where they planned to use an electrical megger to shock Renukaswamy. The police have seized the device. Renukaswamy, an autorickshaw driver and a member of actor Darshan's fanclub, was allegedly kidnapped from Chitradurga district on June 8 after sending derogatory messages to Pavithra Gowda . His body was later found near Sumanahalli Bridge in Bengaluru. CCTV footage accessed by India Today TV shows the moments leading up to Renukaswamy's kidnapping. The accused reportedly began trailing him in an autorickshaw at 9:30 AM when he left home. The autorickshaw was caught on surveillance camera at 9:41 AM while passing a petrol pump. An accomplice can also be seen following on a white scooter. A car allegedly used in the abduction was also seized on Sunday. The vehicle was found parked at a house in Ayyanahalli village in Chitradurga district, according to a PTI report. Ravi, one of the suspects, allegedly left the car there. Several items were confiscated from the vehicle after interrogating Ravi’s family. Darshan, known as the \"Challenging Star,\" and 12 associates were initially arrested last Tuesday (June 11). Police custody for Darshan, Gowda, and 11 others was extended on Saturday as the investigation continues."

In his post on X, Upendra mentioned that the case is being closely watched by people across the nation. He batted for an impartial probe in the high-profile case. So far, Divya Spandana, Ram Gopal Varma and Kichcha Sudeep have opened up about the ongoing case. His post read, \"The investigation which has been going on for the past few days is not only being watched in Karnataka but across India. Awaiting impartial decision and justice in the trial of this high-profile case.\" He further added that there is some suspicion in the minds of Renukaswamy's family, the public, the media and Darshan's fans. He appealed for some reforms which could ensure transparency in the way an investigation is carried out in such high-profile cases. Here's his post: A post shared by Upendra Kumar (@nimmaupendra) Some of the suggestions he mentioned read, \"In any case, the video footage of the trial of the case and all the details of the witnesses should be shared by the police with the families of the concerned persons from time to time. It should become a law. (In the past, the police used to record the details of interrogation in writing, but now technology has advanced so much that everything can be recorded and streamed live.)\" Upendra also clarified that having a transparent trial will not give way to tampering of evidence, interference by influential people and corruption. Darshan, his partner Pavithra Gowda and 10 others have been arrested for the alleged murder of a man named Renukaswamy. The man allegedly sent derogatory messages to Pavithra, which led to his abduction. He was then found dead at Sumanahalli Bridge in Bengaluru."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story We all experience a mix of love and frustration with our families, and we know you can relate. There are moments when we want to shower our loved ones with affection, yet the same people can sometimes drive us to the brink of pulling our hair out in frustration. However, there are certain relatives who bring toxicity into our lives, and it's crucial to maintain distance from them. In the past, Boomers and Gen X often struggled with setting boundaries with toxic relatives, enduring a lot in silence. Millennials began to take a stand and assert themselves, but it's Gen Z who are truly changing the game. They are setting new standards for mental health and well-being by refusing to tolerate toxic behaviour and prioritising their peace. \"In the Indian family setup, loyalty and maintaining relationships are deeply valued, often regardless of the treatment one receives. However, the younger generation increasingly challenges this notion, driven by a growing awareness of mental health and personal well-being. They recognise that enduring toxic behaviour is detrimental and choose self-preservation over traditional obligations,\" Dr Gorav Gupta, Gurugram-based psychiatrist and co-founder of Emoneeds (a mental health start-up), tells India Today . Agreeing with this, Dr Kriti Anand, consultant, psychiatry, Paras Health, Panchkula, adds that financial and social independence also allows the younger generation to make decisions that prioritise their well-being. Moreover, global exposure to cultures that respect personal boundaries influences the younger generation to adopt similar practices, fostering a more individualistic and self-care-oriented mindset. \"Cutting off toxic relatives is crucial because their manipulative behaviour, including gaslighting, selective support, and emotional manipulation, can have a profound impact on your mental health, self-confidence, and overall well-being,\" shares Dr Sukriti Rex, lead psychologist and researcher at Evolve (a health-tech startup). She adds that by setting boundaries and removing these individuals from life, the constant stress and anxiety caused by toxic relationships are alleviated, self-confidence is restored through prioritising your own needs, and emotional energy is redirected towards more positive and fulfilling connections. Getting rid of toxic relatives is very important (Photo: Getty Images) Additionally, this step can facilitate healing from emotional abuse and trauma, allowing you to prioritise your health and happiness over tolerating unacceptable behaviour. Essential for safeguarding mental health Dr Gupta explains that toxic relatives can severely impact your mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. The constant negativity can erode your sense of self-worth and create an environment of perpetual stress. \"Identifying a toxic relative involves recognising specific behaviours and patterns that negatively impact your well-being,\" says Dr Anand. The doctor adds that apart from affecting your mental health, toxic relatives can spoil other relationships by spreading negativity and creating conflict within your social circle. \"When dealing with toxic relatives, it's crucial to prioritise your own well-being and not internalise their behaviour. Seeking support from trusted friends, a therapist, or a support group can provide a much-needed outlet and validate your experiences,\" says Dr Rex. It's important not to engage with their toxic patterns or attempt to reason with them, as this can perpetuate the cycle. Always prioritise yourself (Photo: Getty Images) Maintaining perspective by reminding yourself that their behaviour reflects their own issues and not your worth is essential. Remember that patience, self-compassion, and a commitment to personal growth and healing are key when navigating these challenging relationships. Cutting off toxic relatives is a difficult but crucial process for mental health and overall happiness. Approach it with determination and support to create a healthier environment for yourself. While it's common to feel guilty or doubt your decision, remind yourself that protecting your well-being is a legitimate and necessary step."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Albania snatched an equaliser in added time for a stunning 2-2 draw against Croatia in a thrilling European Championship contest on Wednesday, but the result left both countries with a tall order if they are to progress to the last-16. Klaus Gjasula proved both hero and villain, bagging the added time leveller after having earlier netted an own goal that saw Croatia go 2-1 up in the Group B clash at the Volksparkstadion. Both countries now have a single point after their opening two matches and are left effectively needing to win their last group games on Monday if they are to progress into the knockout stage. No team has made the next round with just two draws since the Euro finals expanded to 24 teams in 2016 -- offering a place in the last-16 to the four best third-placed finishers. Albania had taken an early lead but the Croats scored twice in the space of two minutes to revive their hopes in a match full of twists and turns and played to a backdrop of ear-splitting noise. Andrej Kramaric grabbed a 74th minute equaliser and then followed an own goal from Gjasula 120 seconds later as an increasingly dominant Croatia, who lost 3-0 to Spain in their opening game, clawed their way back. They had pounded away at the Albania goal in the second half after looking anxious and frustrated at halftime as their unfancied opponents went into the break ahead. Qazim Laci’s 11th minute header put Albania in an early lead, as had been the case against Italy in their opening game when they scored after just 23 seconds. This time they were a touch tardy, weathering early pressure before Jasir Asani whipped in a cross from the right that Laci got a glancing head to before it slipped under goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic. The Croat keeper could have done better but made up for the slip with two key saves later in the first half, denying Kristjan Asllani and then stopping Rey Manaj’s diving header as Albania came close to doubling their lead. Albania’s gritty determination - and the speed with which they seized counterattacking opportunities - belied their lowly ranking, some 56 places below 10th placed Croatia. A double change at the break for Croatia was followed by intense pressure on the Albania goal with Thomas Strakosha saving from Luka Sucic and Mateo Kovacic to keep the lead intact right until the 74th minute when Kramaric, on his 33rd birthday, netted from close range. He shot through the legs of Elseid Hysaj while wrongfooting Strakosha. Then came the own goal as Ante Budimir’s shot, set up by Mario Pasalic's pull back from the byline, was blocked by Berat Djimsiti only for the rebound to hit Gjasula and go into his own net. But Albania were not to be outdone and Gjasula sidefooted into the net with five minutes of additional time already played for a dramatic conclusion to the contest. \"This is why everyone loves football. In the last seconds, sometimes you score a goal to win, sometimes you concede,\" said Kramaric. Albania finish their group schedule against Spain in Duesseldorf on Monday and Gjasula said they held out hope. \"We know that the game with Spain is very difficult but in football everything is possible. If we will play like today everything can happen,” he told reporters. Croatia will meet Italy in Leipzig at the same time with the odds against them. \"The first half was very bad but the second much better, which is encouraging for the match with Italy,\" added Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic. \"We are still in the game, we shall prepare and do all in our power to go on.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The cryogenic upper stage of India's heaviest rocket, Launch Vehicle Mark-III (LVM3) that launched the OneWeb-2 has been successfully deorbited and disposed from space. The rocket made anticipated re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere on June 14, marking a significant step in India's commitment to sustainable space operations. The nearly 3-ton rocket body, identified by NORAD ID 56082, was left in an orbit of 450 km altitude after successfully injecting 36 OneWeb satellites on March 26, 2023. In accordance with standard practices, the upper stage underwent passivation by depleting excess fuel to minimise any potential risk of an accidental break-up. The re-entry occurred within the planned window and the material burned up above the Indian Ocean. Only certain elements, such as gas bottles, nozzles, and tanks comprising materials with very high melting points, were expected to survive the intense aerothermal heating during the re-entry process. OneWeb satellites integrated in LVM3 rocket. (Photo: Isro) The object's trajectory was meticulously tracked by the Multi-object Tracking Radar (MOTR) of ISRO at Sriharikota over multiple orbits before atmospheric re-entry. The tracking data was utilized in the re-entry prediction process, ensuring a safe and controlled descent. The LVM3-M3 rocket body was disposed of through natural orbital decay within two years of its orbital injection, complying with international guidelines such as the UN space debris mitigation guidelines. This achievement aligns with India's commitment to preserving the long-term sustainability of outer space activities. Furthermore, the rocket stage adhered to the directives of India's Debris Free Space Missions (DFSM) initiative, which requires space objects operating in the Low Earth Orbital region to remain in orbit for less than five years after the end of their mission. The re-entry of the LVM3-M3 rocket body was continuously monitored by ISRO's facility, the ISRO System for Safe and Sustainable Space Operations Management (IS4OM), at the ISTRAC in Bengaluru."

President Droupadi Murmu administered the oath of office to Mahtab at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Mahtab is set to preside over the Lok Sabha session, which begins today , and will oversee the oath-taking ceremony for newly elected MPs. Mahtab will convene the Lok Sabha session at 11 am in Parliament House. He will first call upon Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Leader of the Lok Sabha, to take oath as member of the House. Catch LIVE Updates from Parliament Session 2024 here The seven-time MP will then administer oath to the panel of chairpersons appointed by the President to assist him in carrying out the proceedings of the House till the election of the Speaker on June 26. After the panel of chairpersons, Mahtab will administer the oath as Lok Sabha members to the Council of Ministers. The appointment of Mahtab has drawn criticism from the Opposition, particularly the Congress, which alleges that the government overlooked the claim of its member Kodikunnil Suresh, who has served eight terms in the Lok Sabha. Suresh was expected to be appointed pro tem Speaker based on seniority, a convention historically followed in the Lok Sabha. Congress leaders, including Jairam Ramesh and KC Venugopal, have accused the BJP-led government of violating parliamentary norms and politicising the appointment. Ramesh stated that by convention, the MP who has served the maximum terms is appointed pro tem Speaker for the first two days when the oath is administered to all newly elected MPs. The controversy has also been linked to Mahtab's recent switch from the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) to the BJP ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju defended the appointment, asserting that Mahtab has had seven uninterrupted terms as a Lok Sabha member, making him eligible for the post. Meanwhile, Suresh’s electoral defeats in 1998 and 2004 mean that his current term is his fourth consecutive one in the Lower House. The pro tem Speaker’s role is crucial during the initial days of a new Lok Sabha session, overseeing the swearing-in of newly elected members and facilitating the election of the Speaker. The first session of the 18th Lok Sabha will continue until July 3, during which the new Speaker of the House will be elected."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday advocated the need for consensus while making decisions for the welfare of the country, saying it is of \"utmost importance\" in his remarks ahead of the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha. His remarks assume significance as the NDA government won a third straight term but with a reduced mandate, with the BJP itself falling short of the majority mark for the first time in a decade. In his customary address before the Parliament session commenced, PM Modi said his government would fulfill the aspirations of the people with the help of consensus among his allies. \"In the last 10 years, we have always tried to implement a tradition because we believe that a majority is required to run the government but to run the country a consensus is of utmost importance. So, it will be our constant efforts to serve Maa Bharti and fulfill the aspirations and ambitions of the 140 crore people, with everyone's consent and by taking everyone together,\" he said. \"We want to go ahead and speed up decisions by taking everyone together, by maintaining the sanctity of the Constitution,\" he added. In the 18th Lok Sabha, the NDA has 293 members with the BJP having 240, 32 short of a majority. The Opposition INDIA bloc has 234 members with the Congress accounting for 99. During his address, PM Modi called on the Opposition members to maintain the dignity of democracy by not disrupting the session's proceedings. He said the people did not want drama or slogans being raised in the House, but substance. \"The people of the country expect good steps from the Opposition. I hope that the Opposition will live up to the expectations of the common citizens of the country to maintain the dignity of democracy. People do not want drama or disturbance. People want substance, not slogans,\" he said. \"The country needs a good Opposition, a responsible opposition and I have full faith that the MPs who have won in this 18th Lok Sabha will try to fulfill these expectations of the common man,\" he said. The Prime Minister also invoked Emergency, a day ahead of its 50th anniversary, saying it was a \"blot\" on India's democracy \"when the Constitution was discarded\". \"Tomorrow is June 25, which marks 50 years of the blot that was put on the democracy of India. The new generation of India will never forget that the Constitution of India was completely rejected, every part of the Constitution was torn to pieces, the country was turned into a prison and democracy was completely suppressed,\" he said. \"While protecting our Constitution, while protecting the democracy of India and the democratic traditions, the countrymen will take a resolution that no one will dare to do such a thing in India again which was done 50 years ago. We will take a resolution of a vibrant democracy. We will take a resolution to fulfil the dreams of the common people as per the directions of the Constitution of India,\" he added. The Parliament session, the first since the Lok Sabha elections, saw newly elected MPs, including PM Modi taking oath. This will be followed by the election of the Lok Sabha Speaker on June 26 and President Droupadi Murmu's address to a joint sitting of both Houses on June 27. The Opposition, buoyed by its increased numbers, is expected to be combative, focusing on issues such as alleged irregularities in the NEET-UG and NET exams, the relocation of statues within the Parliament complex, and the government's decision to appoint seven-term BJP MP Bhartruhari Mahtab as the pro tem Speaker. The 264th Session of the Rajya Sabha will also begin on June 27, and the joint session will conclude on July 3, resuming for the monsoon sitting on July 22."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Foreign affairs analyst and economic expert Fareed Zakaria defines India's preception to the United States in one word - disappointment. Speaking to India Today TV's Rahul Kanwal at Davos 2020, Fareed Zakaria said that India's eroding secular, democratic values have affected its chances of forming lasting ties with the United States as the US elites have been disappointed by India. \"Americans want to like India, because they like the idea of India - open, liberal, secular, democracy, compared with China and even of its own terms,\" Zakaria said, adding the image has been hit by two things. \"First, India has disappointed on growth and openness story economically. There was a feeling that India was going to be next China, but it hasn't quite worked out like that way. \"Second and much more disturbing, over the last few years India has been turning away from its secular and even democratic credentials with regards to some areas like freedom of the press, independence of the judiciary, treatment of minorities, etc. It is causing a lot of anxieties,\" Fareed Zakaria said. Fareed Zakaria argued that the United States was more likely to make strong, lasting and meaningful ties with nations that share values rather than mere strategic interests. \"Closest alliances for Americans are not just of interests but also of values, for example, their closest allies include Britain, western European nations, Japan, and even Israel. Shallowest relationships are when you making an alliance just for the strategic benefit like US-Saudi Arabia,\" he said. Zakaria argues that India has the potential to have a deep relationship with America. \"But I think, there is a sense of disappointment in the last two or three years.\" On being asked about a similar condition in the US in terms of decisions taken by the Trump administration, Fareed Zakaria said that the two nations are in a different league from each other on the issue like press and institutional freedom. \"The way press reports on Donald Trump in the US, I think you will not find Indian press reporting about Narendra Modi that way. Even institutions have held up [against Trump], courts, FBI, CIA, Trump half the time is fighting with his own government as it is trying to maintain integrity and independence,\" he said."

While both are exported by the carmaker, only the Magnite is sold in the domestic market. The Sunny is no more offered here. With a limited portfolio, Nissan exports more vehicles from India than original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like Mahindra, Tata, Renault and Skoda. In April-May FY25, Nissan exported 4,632 units, according to data from the industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). In comparison, Mahindra shipped 1,639 units, Tata 478 units, Renault 478 units and Skoda 175 units during the same period. While Nissan exported 3,196 units of the Sunny, the company shipped 1,436 units of the Magnite. For the domestic market, Nissan has already started testing the Magnite facelift. The Magnite was initially launched in India in December 2020. Apart from the usual variants, the compact SUV is also available in special edition models like Geza, Red and Kuro. Nissan Magnite We expect the Nissan Magnite facelift to come with exterior and interior updates. There will be changes to the front fascia and rear. Inside the cabin, some tweaks will be made to the dashboard. Currently, the Nissan Magnite has two engine options -- B4D 1.0-litre NA petrol (72PS and 96Nm) and HRAO 1.0-litre Turbo petrol (100PS and 160Nm/152Nm). The NA petrol gets 5-speed MT and AMT choices, while the turbo petrol has 5-speed MT and CVT choices. These powertrains will be available in the facelift as well. The Nissan Magnite price starts at Rs 6 lakh and goes up to Rs 11.11 lakh (ex-showroom). It is also India's most affordable automatic SUV with the AMT starting at Rs 6.60 lakh (ex-showroom). We expect the Nissan Magnite facelift launch in India to take place towards the end of 2024. The Nissan Magnite facelift price in India will see a jump as well."

The clearance has been denied from a 'political angle' and because the \"event is not commensurate in status for participation by the chief minister of a state\". The conference will be attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Pope Francis and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. The event will be centred on Mother Teresa. Earlier, the Italian government had requested Mamata Banerjee not to come with any delegates. West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee then proposed industry delegation clearance and requested the Ministry of External Affairs for the same. However, the clearance was not given. TMC spokesperson Debangshu Bhattacharya Dev took to Twitter to express his opinion on the denial of permission to Mamata Banerjee. He wrote, \"Central government denied permission for Didi's Rome trip! Previously they've cancelled the permission of China trip too. We accepted that decision keeping international relations and India's interests in mind. Now why Italy Modi ji? What is your problem with Bengal? Chi!\" Central government denied permission for Didi's Rome trip! Previously they've cancelled the permission of China trip too.

Chi! — Debangshu Bhattacharya Dev (@ItsYourDev) September 25, 2021 \"We have a meeting in Rome for world peace. The German Chancellor would have been present along with the Pope. The Italian government had invited me and their government had given us special permission to visit. But now, the Central government has just denied permission,\" said Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. \"Why? Is it because it is not right for a CM to visit? Wherever I try to go somewhere, they create hurdles but they roam around the world,\" said Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Many people can’t visit abroad, the US or UK as Covaxin is not recognized by WHO but our PM has gone abroad with special permission. Did he think once that so many students have been denied the opportunity to visit? I have no problem with PM’s visit. But why did you not allow me to represent the country? Why did you stop me? Each time you stop me like that. You cannot stop me all the time. Each time you indulge in such illegal acts.

Lobo, who represents Calangute Assembly constituency, was in the news recently for inauguring a statue of Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo in the town of Calangute.

ALSO READ | How Prashant Kishor and Congress split and why they are making up now After the repeated debacles, first in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and then in the assembly elections held earlier this year, the Congress’s floundering ship is now desperately depending on a solid plan to reclaim its lost glory. For this, the party leadership sought Prashant Kishor’s insights. He is understood to have delivered a blueprint for the Congress’s revival. In his presentation, Prashant Kishor laid out the Congress’s current position in the country’s political scene with special focus on its statistical strengths and weaknesses. The plan, a blueprint for the preparation of the 2024 Lok Sabha election, highlighted India’s population, the number of Congress MPs and MLAs, the party’s outlook towards women, youth, small businessmen, and farmers. Prashant Kishor also focused on the importance of the 13 crore first-time voters in 2024. The Congress had just 90 MPs in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and 800 MLAs in the country, Prashant Kishor reminded the Congress leadership. He said the Congress was in power in three states, while it was part of coalition governments in three more. It is the main Opposition in 13 states.

Only a few days ago, amid speculation over his possible exit from the party, Hardik Patel told India Today, \" I am very much in the Congress party.\" It is believed that Hardik Patel's discontent is rooted in the lack of clarity over his responsibilities and position in the Congress party. It is believed that he also feels some Congress leaders in Gujarat are not allowing him to work. The Congress is holding a three-day Chintan Shivir in Rajasthan's Udaipur this weekend.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Amid the political upheaval in Bihar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar met his party MLAs and MPs on Tuesday. According to sources, Nitish Kumar is on route for another break-up with its NDA-ally BJP and is likely to resign after meeting the Governor at 4 pm today. In 2015, Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United) parted ways with the BJP and joined hands with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress. The JD(U)-RJD-Congress 'Mahagathbandhan' won the Bihar Assembly election in 2015, with Nitish Kumar returning as the chief minister and RJD's Tejashwi Yadav as his deputy. Follow Bihar politics LIVE Updates However, the alliance could not last long as Nitish Kumar brought down the Mahagathbandhan government in 2017 and joined hands with the BJP again. Here are the key takeaways from the political situation in Bihar: 1) Nitish Kumar is a leader who has no permanent friends or enemies in politics. Nitish Kumar has made stunning switches for power in the past. While ruling Bihar with the BJP, he quit the NDA and tied up with the RJD. Then he deserted the RJD and went back to the BJP-led coalition. 2) By ditching the BJP, Nitish Kumar hopes to ensure his immediate survival in Bihar with a tie-up with the RJD. The BJP had been making Nitish Kumar the chief minister despite his JD)U) being the junior partner in the ruling alliance in Bihar. The idea was to expand the BJP’s base at the cost of the JD(U), and even Nitish Kumar’s own popularity. The saffron party wanted to have its own chief minister soon. 3) Nitish may now seek to revive his hope of being seen as a long-term rival to Prime Minister Narendra Modi nationally. There is also a theory of Nitish Kumar, once out of the NDA, emerging as one of the prime ministerial candidates in 2024 if the Congress does not do too well and state leaders somehow have the numbers to put together a 'khichdi sarkar'. 4) The Nitish Kumar of 2022 is greatly diminished compared to the Nitish of 2013 because of his frequent U-turns. Tejashwi Yadav has emerged as a strong opposition leader and may not trust Nitish Kumar fully or embrace the JD(U)’s anti-incumbency without conditions. 5) Nitish breaking up with the BJP will give a fillip to the Opposition after the collapse of Maharashtra’s Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. For the Congress, it would be a revenge of sorts. 6) The BJP’s long-term plan remains to emerge as party number one in Bihar by building a broader caste coalition. It would like to project Nitish Kumar’s “betrayal” to mobilise support in its favour. 7) In the short term, the BJP will see Nitish Kumar's departure and a loss of another ally as a setback ahead of 2024 general elections. The BJP knows that going into the national elections without Nitish Kumar will send the wrong socio-political message, and the party may have to pay electoral costs. 8) The BJP will revive the anti-corruption plank and jungle raj memories against Lalu Yadav and the Opposition. 9) Parties like the Congress have limited options in Bihar and the Hindi heartland but to align with bigger players. It’s the best-case scenario for the grand old party. 10) But it should not be forgotten that Nitish Kumar is just one of many challengers for the Opposition leadership along with Mamata Banerjee, Arvind Kejriwal and the Gandhis. 11) Trigger for Nitish's move was arguably the BJP’s successful coup in Maharashtra in breaking the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government. 12) Nitish Kumar has gone back to Lalu-Tejashwi combo but this time, the latter have more leverage since they have more numbers in the Bihar Assembly and Nitish'sesperation is greater.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Shashi Tharoor may have just got Congress chief Sonia Gandhi’s go ahead to contest the party’s presidential polls on October 17. “Anyone is free to contest the Congress presidential poll,” Sonia Gandhi told Shashi Tharoor today when the MP conveyed his decision to the party’s interim chief at 10, Janpath, sources in the Congress told India Today TV. “It's your call. Elections will be held according to the electoral process,” Sonia Gandhi told Tharoor, the sources added. Echoing the party's interim chief, Jairam Ramesh said, \"Anybody who wants to contest is free and welcome to do so. This has been the consistent position of the Congress president and Rahul Gandhi. This is an open, democratic and transparent process. Nobody needs anybody's nod to contest.” Tharoor, along with fellow party leaders Deepender Hooda, Jai Prakash Agarwal and Vijendra Singh, met Sonia Gandhi at her home today for a discussion over the upcoming Congress presidential election. The Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram created quite a buzz when he declared his candidacy for the post of Congress chief, calling for a contest with 'several candidates'. Even though Tharoor is not a part of the Group of 23 dissident Congress leaders, or the G-23, he has been vocal about bringing reforms within the party. However, this March, Tharoor had met the G-23 leaders. In an article for the Malayalam daily 'Mathrubhumi', Tharoor wrote that electing a new president would be the beginning of the revitalization the party badly needs. Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot will file his nomination for the Congress’s presidential election between September 26 and September 28 during Navratri, sources told India Today TV. Facing unprecedented internal tussles, the Congress announced that it would hold a poll to elect the party’s next president on October 17. The result will be declared two days later, on October 19. At a press conference where the party announced the election schedule, its general secretary (Organisation) KC Venugopal said, “Anybody can contest the election. It is an open election.” Rahul Gandhi resigned as the Congress president in 2019, taking responsibility for the party’s second consecutive defeat in the 2019 parliamentary elections.

The Congress is set to hold a meeting of its legislature party in Rajasthan at Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot's Jaipur residence at 7 pm today.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Banaras Hindu University (BHU), established by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya in 1916, has relentlessly pursued education as a nation-building project in line with the vision of its founding father. But as it closes out a hundred illustrious years of existence, the institution has harnessed its heritage to branch out into niche areas across disciplines instead of getting fossilised-a fate that befalls many institutions of such vintage. The dynamism is reflected in its steady rise in the India Today Group-Nielsen Best Universities Survey, from fourth place in 2013 to third place last year to the second spot this year. BHU's sustained rise is leveraged on an equally stellar performance in the arts and the sciences and a knack for sensing and riding the winds of change. Take, for instance, the Centre for Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy, set up in 2008 to analyse the politics of discrimination latent-and often apparent-in our socio-political frameworks. Apart from touching upon larger topics of social justice and self-respect movements, the centre focuses on a re-reading of history and ideology premised on their very exclusion from dominant narratives. It now offers MPhil and PhD programmes in Subaltern Studies. The approach is theoretical as well as empirical, thereby opening avenues for research in academically neglected areas of interest. The Malaviya Centre for Peace Research, launched in 1998 under the VIII UGC Plan, is another increasingly popular department that focuses on conditions specific to different conflict zones. In February 2014, Professor Priyankar Upadhyaya from the department was awarded the ICCR Chair Professorship at Dublin City University. If the social exclusion and peace research centres map political cross-currents and are geared towards the larger object of formulating and influencing public policy, the Centre for Integrated Rural Development's bi-weekly herbal cultivation training programme literally takes one back to the grassroots, training students how to make herbal teas, oils and medicinal concoctions from scratch. The Faculty of Visual Arts is a spin on fine arts as we know it. Having incorporated plastic, textile and pottery classes alongside that of applied art, it demonstrates a continuity of form across mediums. It's rare for such a programme to churn out students who want to pursue art full-time, but the course arms them with a keen sense of perception. Supplemented with advertising and design campaigns, it's a far cry from today's marketing-driven classes. The university is all set to embrace interdisciplinary studies under the Choice-Based Credit System, set to be introduced from the next academic session. Vice Chancellor Girish Chandra Tripathi believes the interdisciplinary approach blends well with BHU's vision of imparting students with holistic learning. \"A person has multiple talents and if you limit their energies to just one of them, there remain aspects of the mind and personality that become idle. This interdisciplinary approach to education provides the fullest possible development of personality. We want to provide students an opportunity and platform where they can fulfil this objective of a career-building process,\" he says. While the interdisciplinary approach awaits rollout, the university's departments continue to grow in stature. In 2014, Padma Shris were awarded to two senior professors of the Institute of Medical Sciences, for long among the leading medical schools-S. Chooramani Gopal from Department of Paediatric Surgery and retired Professor K.C. Chunekar from the Department of Dravyaguna. The students are not far behind. Author and musician Subhankar De, a master's in musicology at the Faculty of Performing Arts, swept the music awards at the Inter University Zonal and National Youth Festivals financed by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports in 2013-14. At the national level, Anand Mishra was first runner-up in the percussion instrumental category at the Youth Festival in 2015. Research scholar Prasann Kumar from the Department of Plant Physiology was awarded the Young Scientist Award by the Bioved Research Society at the 16th Indian Agricultural Scientists & Farmers' Congress in Lucknow in February 2014. Twenty Junior Research Fellowships are secured every year by each department on average, lending further impetus to research at BHU. Faculty across departments published 325 national and 18 international books in the academic year 2013-14. The Faculty of Management Studies, identified as a Quality Improvement Programme Centre by the All India Council for Technical Education in 2001, also brings out a research journal, BHU Management Review, which highlights the best of contemporary management research. Through this faculty, the university has signed MoUs with colleges in Ethiopia and Germany as well as five universities in the US. Vice Chancellor Tripathi recalls BHU's repute in days of yore: \"The first dean of the then faculty of music, Omkarnath Thakur, took it upon himself to cure (Italian dictator Benito) Mussolini's insomnia by playing sleep-inducing tunes. Mussolini, disgruntled after several long days of wakefulness, agreed to give it a try. The rest, as they say, is history. Mussolini slept like a baby for the next few days to make up for all the lost sleep.\" While the Mussolini story may be apocryphal, BHU's rock-solid reputation is as real as it gets, then as well as now. Being traditional The convocation gown of BHU graduates has been replaced with kurta, pyjama and safas reminiscent of the kind that Madan Mohan Malaviya used to wear."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Mathematics is a science of attention and observation. As a mathematician, Delhi University (DU) Vice Chancellor Dinesh Singh loves observing things-from the trivial to the serious. For instance, he can tell you that a girl student of Delhi University is more likely to talk over phone while walking than her male counterpart. At the same time, he also knows that students get more excited to be a part of an airplane design team than to simply learn about fluid dynamics in classrooms. \"Show them the practical utility of what they are learning and give them real-world experience, this will stimulate their minds and help them find their inner calling. That's the goal of education,\" says Singh. It's these minute observations which not only help Singh turn DU into an innovative centre of learning but also maintain its numero uno position for the third time in a row in the India Today Group-Nielsen Best Universities survey. The reputation of the university certainly attracts the brightest talent from across the country which is reflected in the mad rush for admissions to its various courses. The fact that 400 candidates have been shortlisted to fill up 11 posts of assistant professors in the Cluster Innovation Centre (CIC) also explains why the university is never short of quality teachers. Yet Singh got a big jolt in the first year of his tenure as a top multinational company, which came to the campus at his request for recruit-ment, told him how unemployable a majority of his students were. That's when he started a series of innovative exercises in the university. The primary focus has been to enhance real-world applicability of knowledge or skill development-one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pet projects. Since 2012, undergraduate students have been encouraged to take up research in a particular field and derive solutions that can benefit the society. A university document explains the rationale behind this programme launched as Innovation Projects in Colleges: \"While teachers often said they wished for research opportunity, the students were often seeking interdisciplinary exposure. Given a curriculum which was bounded by a discipline-based syllabus and strict timetables for lectures, the teachers and students did not have the time or the grants to consider new ways of learning.\" Every teacher in the university is given an initial grant of Rs 5 lakh to encourage start-ups. Science teachers get an additional top-up of Rs 3 lakh every year while arts faculties get Rs 1.5 lakh every year. The results have been astonishing. After receiving training at IIT-Bombay, students at CIC have designed a 3D printer which costs just Rs 20,000 compared to other models available for more than a lakh in the market. In 2014, Delhi University received Rs 40.8 crore as Promotion of University Research and Scientific Excellence (PURSE) grant-the highest among 14 selected recipients. The PURSE grant is offered by the government's Department of Science and Technology in appreciation of R&D contributions. In February this year, the President honoured two teachers, Vijay K. Chaudhary and Amita Gupta from the Department of Biochemistry, with the Best Innovation Award for making a rapid diagnostic test for tuberculosis. The kit has now been tested in the market with success. It's not just research and innovation; there has been a holistic approach to the process of learning. Learning beyond the classroom is encouraged. One such experiment is the Gyanodaya Express-train excursions to various parts of India. In 2014, five trains, including one to the seven states of the North-east, were flagged off. While 900 Delhi University students took part in these excursions, 100 students from King's College, London, and the University of Edinburgh were part of a trip to Ludhiana. \"These trips not only increase knowledge but also create a truly cosmopolitan environment on campus. Students returned with a new perspective about the North-east after their trip,\" says Anu Kapoor, professor, Department of Geography. Student care is also at the top of the agenda at Delhi University. While most of the classrooms are wi-fi enabled, the next goal is to turn the entire university campus into a free wi-fi zone. To enhance security for girl students, the university plans to install CCTV cameras in every corner of the campus. \"I expect the entire campus to be under CCTV scanner in a couple of months,\" says Singh, who also aspires to see DU as a sports hub. This year the boys' hockey team was sent to University of Edinburgh for a month-long training. In 2013, the girls' football team was sent to New Zealand for exposure and training. Special attention is given to differently-abled students who constitute 5 per cent of the total resident students of the university. All of them are given fully loaded laptops and are entitled to free rides in university buses. This year, a group of such students has been sent to South Korea and the UK to learn how these countries take care of differently-abled students. With just four months to go before he retires in October, Singh is increasingly getting restless as he feels he has too many things to finish in too little time. He is unhappy about the lack of communication between teachers of trans-disciplinary studies. \"The mathematics department is located very close to the Department of Statistics. Yet the teachers of the two departments don't communicate with each other. In India, physicists don't talk to chemists, botanists don't talk to bio-technologists. To emerge as a true knowledge hub, we must learn how to channellise our knowledge to real-world application,\" says Singh. Follow the writer on Twitter @KDscribe"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Having been a part of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) for almost three decades, Professor S.K. Sopory is well aware of the pitfalls of the present educational system as well as the huge untapped potential. Sopory, an acclaimed researcher and academic, enumerates his achievements as the vice chancellor of the 45-year-old institution in terms of knocking down the barriers to meaningful research. \"We are breaking down borders between our own schools and centres and other universities across India and the world to have a dialogue to identify issues that are relevant nationally as well as globally. The interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary approach has brought together faculty from across the spectrum to interact with each other and usher in novelty in the learning process. There can be no sectarian approach to learning and education. Notionally sure, but barriers are no more viable. Look at our library. It says we have progressed in all respects,\" says Sopory. Sprawled over 1,000 acres in the Aravallis, JNU has been a premier institute of learning and higher education for some years now and has once again proved its academic credentials as the India Today Group-Nielsen Best Universities Survey puts it among the top three universities in the country this year. The institution has long been known for its research potential, both in science and humanities streams, and top-notch infrastructure and learning environment imbued with freedom of thought. As a part of its initiatives for proffering an interdisciplinary approach to academics, the university has formed a number of trans-disciplinary clusters. \"In our endeavour to keep pace with the new challenges of higher education, a number of such clusters have been formed. The aim is to encourage more dialogue between different centres and schools so that the highest standards of learning can be achieved,\" adds Sopory. Another imaginative and far-reaching initiative of the university has been the setting up of the University with Potential for Excellence (UPE). This is the apex scheme of the University Grants Commission (UGC). This means the top educational fund regulator has granted the university Rs 60 crore, based on its top-notch performance, for research in the field of genomics and proteomics, and also for subjects such as globalisation, national development and knowledge systems interfacing economy, politics, society and culture. \"I'm happy to say that under this scheme, 164 interdisciplinary projects from 350 faculty members have been processed for implementation online, employing e-governance tools,\" says Sopory. He also adds that JNU has started offering a number of novel and well-thought out courses and has expanded its repertoire of offerings for students. \"The revision and updating of academic programmes we offer is a continuous process and thus we have added some new ones and upgraded others.\" The university is now offering direct PhD courses in hitherto neglected areas as North-East India Studies, Human Rights Studies, Energy Studies and Public Health. Pre-PhD/PhD has been restarted in Molecular Medicine, although only for NET-qualified students. It also offers PhD in Nano Sciences. Also, JNU now will offer integrated MSc-PhD in Molecular Medicine, Computational Biology and Complex Systems. On the humanities front, the university is offering MPhil and PhD programmes in Women Studies, Korean Studies, on Discrimination and Exclusion and Media Studies. Students can also pursue MA in Philosophy (introduced from 2013-14 academic session) and a similar programme in Labour Studies. Also, in tandem with the demand for skill development in the country, the university has started such enabling courses for all students. \"The Linguistic Empowerment programme is offering courses to help students gain competence and exposure to English language in basic writing, communication skills as well as academic writing,\" says the vice chancellor. As part of the same initiative, JNU is also trying to help students gain proficiency in mathematics and computation. \"We also want our students to gain a certain degree of empowerment and competence in application of mathematical, statistical and computational frameworks,\" Sopory adds. The vice chancellor rolls out JNU's achievements in recent times with evident satisfaction. On the academic front, he says, \"We have started taking up research projects of national importance with other universities of India.\" JNU is engaged in an inter-university group to study climate change with universities such as the University of Kashmir, University of Jammu and Sikkim University. JNU is also a part of an Indo-US Advanced Bioenergy Consortium for Second Generation Biofuels (IUABC). The consortium is led by JNU and also has IIT-Bombay as a partner institution, while Washington University is also a collaborator. The univer-sity, along with several other Indian institutions, is working on traditional knowledge systems as part of an inter-university body. Their mandate is to integrate traditional systems of knowledge and sustainable development in the Indian Himalayan region. Other than this, the university is perhaps the first in the country to become a 'barrier-free campus', which means physically challenged students don't have to depend on others to trudge through hostile physical infrastructure. What's more, the campus has also emerged as a meeting ground for foodies with the opening of several eating joints that offer a range of dishes-from traditional Indian cuisines to Chinese and Tibetan-at affordable prices. Ritesh Rai, a research scholar in the School of International Studies (SIS), says he has had a life-changing experience in JNU. \"I come from a rural background. JNU has helped me become a modern citizen of not just India, but a member of the global society. Even the ideologically charged student politics on campus is part of the same mainstreaming and education that adds to students' consciousness,\" he says.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In terms of ranking, this year's India Today Group-Nielsen survey of India's best universities hardly throws up any surprises. While University of Delhi (DU) stays comfortably placed at the top for the third consecutive year, University of Kerala takes a remarkable leap-it has jumped 17 positions to rank ninth this year. In 2014, it was placed at number 26. Kurukshetra University has also moved five ranks to occupy the 10th position while Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) has been showing consistent improvement over the years, ranking fourth this time. The Vice Chancellor of AMU, Zameeruddin Shah, has already vowed to grab the top position by 2017. He has an even bigger dream-to be among the top 200 universities in the world by 2020. The significance of this dream can be understood from the fact that not a single Indian university could make it to the list of top 200 universities that are a part of the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. While there are nine Indian universities among the top 100 Asian universities, none of them could find a place among the top 10. Among the top 100 Asian universities, China leads with 21, Japan has 19 and South Korea has 13. Japan, Hong Kong, and South Korea have three universities each in the Asian top-20 list along with two Chinese universities. These results have come as a shock to Indian universities. Especially so when you consider the findings by Ernst & Young: with nearly 140 million people belonging to the college-going age group, one in every four graduates in the world will be a product of the Indian higher education system. India has one of the largest higher education systems in the world and ranks second in terms of student enrolment. India's higher education sector has seen huge expansion in recent times-by 2011, the country was home to more than 35,500 colleges while a decade earlier, the figure stood at 12,800. The country also has nearly 700 universities, but sadly, there has been little focus on original research works, innovation and breakthroughs in science. These have been highlighted in a recent speech by President Pranab Mukherjee, who also happens to be the Visitor of central universities. \"Unless we focus on research, it is not possible to improve the quality of education,\" he said. As many experts involved with the Times ranking point out, Indian universities fare badly in this survey because they give merely 30 per cent weightage to research work. Contrast this with the global superpower US which is the home to the best universities in the world. They are ideal platforms for the exchange of ideas and information and for conducting collaborative research and development work with several partnering nations and institutions around the world. In India, the problem also lies with the regulatory architecture of the government. As former human resource development (MoS) minister Shashi Tharoor points out, our regulatory institutions are stifling academic advancement rather than promoting it. \"Our higher education is over-regulated and under-governed, with the University Grants Commission (UGC), the Medical Council of India, and the All India Council for Technical Education issuing one-size-fits-all directives to prospective universities about the size of their buildings, the number of classrooms and teachers they should have and what they should teach,\" Tharoor says. Ashish Dhawan, one of the trustees of Ashoka University, Sonipat, believes that the misplaced focus of regulatory authorities contributes towards the poor state of affairs in Indian universities. \"The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) should be strengthened and there should be increasing focus on student learning outcomes,\" he says. Another worrying fact is that our educational institutes have failed to churn out employable students. According to the India Skill Report (ISR), compiled by Wheebox, PeopleStrong, LinkedIn and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in 2014, only 37 per cent of Indian graduates are employable. \"We must move out of classrooms and students must be given hands-on training and must be encouraged to innovate,\" says DU Vice Chancellor Dinesh Singh. While the government remains the biggest spender in the education sector, India's spending on higher education, at 1.22 per cent of the GDP, is quite low compared to the US's 3.1 per cent. But if Budget 2015-16 is any indication, the government is focussing more on this grey area. Though the overall education budget has seen a reduction of 2 per cent, higher education has been given a plan allocation of Rs 158,555.26 crore in 2015-16, as against Rs 130,000 crore in 2014-15, an increase of nearly 22 per cent. The economic boom has seen the emergence of a large number of private universities. As Dhawan says, these institutes are breaking conventional paradigms and offering unique courses. But some scepticism remains as academicians point out that in India, private universities focus on making more money than on quality of education. At a time when nearly 60 per cent of college-going students in the country are enrolled in private institutions, the government must ensure that strict quality control measures are in place.

We have already formed an apex committee for the NEP’s implementation. Even before the NEP was released, JNU has been practising multi-disciplinary education. The objective in the university is to create conversations among people from different disciplines. That results in more creativity and innovation. It’s one of the reasons why the best students in the country come to this university. For instance, a student doing MA in International Studies can also do another course from the School of Social Sciences or in languages."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story An extensive 1,370-acre campus is just the primary distinction of the 97-year-old Osmania University (OU), which get its name from the last of the Asaf Jah line of kings: Osman Ali Khan. It has blossomed, like institutions seldom do, to symbolise a renaissance in the Indian educational system. Founded and developed by the visionary and institution-building Nizams of Hyderabad with Urdu as the medium of instruction in 1918, when learning of English was compulsory, the university has evolved steadily. It switched to English medium in 1948, and, in recent decades, spawned 11 universities in Telangana. \"The distinct ethos coupled with the sharp focus on organic growth has enabled Osmania, in spite of several vicissitudes, to show a remarkable resilience and grow into one of the major universities of India,\" explains Osmania University (OU) Registrar Professor E. Suresh Kumar, himself a postgraduate (in English) from the university. \"We have developed in phases-from the formative, through consolidation and advancement, to excellence-while retaining the enduring connect with societal needs. OU is a shining symbol of lifelong learning.\" To stay relevant in the changing times, the seventh oldest university in the country has introduced courses in areas of environmental sciences, biotechnology, genetic engineering, tourism and hotel management, computer applications, rural engineering and health technology. For this, the university has strengthened its infrastructure, both in terms of physical development of the campus as well as the support systems, besides granting autonomy to colleges to enable them to be receptive to innovations in their respective fields, and towards community demands. For students of astronomy and astrophysics, for instance, the university has its own lunar observatory in Rangapur on the eastern fringe of the city to observe a clear night sky without the scatter of artificial light. Several interdisciplinary academic activity centres have also been established in OU with financial support from national and international agencies. Among these are the Regional Centre for Urban and Environmental Studies, Institute of Genetics, Research and Training Unit of Navigational Electronics, the Centre for Area Studies and an exclusive English Language Teaching Centre. The university authorities have introduced several academic and administrative reforms at the same time to sustain the efforts and match them with the changing needs of society. The university has expanded several faculties and improved infrastructure for research and education by adding more built-up area and support system. Besides constituent colleges of the university, several colleges in Hyderabad and its environs are affiliated to it. \"The university truly exemplifies continuity, change, tradition and modernity in higher education in tune with the national policy,\" says Ranjeev R. Acharya, principal secretary, higher education, Telangana, who doubles as the OU vice chancellor. Besides former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, other Osmania graduates include former Maharashtra chief minister and Union minister Shankarrao Chavan, former Lok Sabha speaker Shivraj Patil, former Andhra Pradesh CM M. Channa Reddy, Telangana's first and incumbent CM K. Chandrasekhar Rao, besides diplomats Abid Hussain and Syed Bashiruddin, former ambassadors to the US and Qatar respectively. \"Osmania University envisages for itself a proactive role in re-engineering the higher education system to establish a knowledge-based society,\" Registrar Suresh Kumar says. \"The university has started far-reaching initiatives to promote scholarship and innovation in higher education and to modernise the university's governance.\" Named a \"University with Potential for Excellence\" in 2012, OU has witnessed significant growth in the last three years. Now, 23 of its 53 departments are accorded the Special Assistance Programme status, 16 members of the faculty hold the world average of H-index while 12 retirees are recognised as emeritus professor by the UGC. New and innovative courses offered include those in biotechnology, pharmacy, forensic science, environmental science, informatics, MCom (Finance) and MTech (Biomedical Electronics) based on demand, social relevance, economic benefits and to create a pool of fresh expertise. OU is also developing the curricula for new degrees and courses, including honours programmes, Finishing Studies, Research-Integrated PG and PhD programmes and Work-Integrated UG-PG programmes. \"All these are part of initiatives to restructure the existing models of governance to ensure efficiency and effectiveness of delivery of services and to establish an integrated framework of knowledge and information to enhance the quality of higher education,\" says Professor A. Ravinder Nath, dean, Development and UGC Affairs. Evidently, OU, with 32 undergraduate, 95 postgraduate and 60 PhD programmes, is poised for further growth (the number of students is already nearing a staggering 315,000) and, perhaps, turn fissile to trigger the opening of more universities.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A varsity academic career, for many, exemplifies the closure of teenage angst, a bittersweet farewell to carefree days and the heralding of an intellectual blossoming tempered only by the limitations of one's enthusiasm. Bearing a testimony to the remarkable vision of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) offers this and much more to its students even today. Deep in the heart of Varanasi lies a 1,360-acre campus, a veritable island of learning that nurtures a generation of nation-builders year after year. The largest residential university in Asia, BHU was established in 1916 as an exemplar of academic excellence and has become synonymous with a way of life teeming with enriching experiences. The institution, a pioneer in interdisciplinary and innovative research, has been ranked the third-best university in India in this year's India Today-Nielsen Best Universities Survey. The one-of-a-kind university that strikes a balance between its original ideals of overall personality development, moral grit and technological awareness, BHU has 116 departments with a delightful array of subjects-ranging from technical and philosophical to the vocational. A case in point is the Department of Library and Information Science, a course that lends a peek into the massive backstage operations of information systems. The critical aspect of residence on campus is that it opens up unique opportunities for mentorship, research and contribution to regional development in terms of protecting the heritage of Varanasi. Delving into the intricacies of energy management in the city that sees a massive tourist footfalls, Indian Institute of Technology-BHU has devised initiatives on solar heating/cooling applications, solar laundry, splash wash technology and solar-powered autorickshaws. The Department of Veterinary Sciences awaits recognition from the Veterinary Council of India, hoping to set a precedence for animal care in India. Those growing up on a diet of James Herriot and Gerald Durrell books could well find and nurture their passion here. A cause close to Vice- Chancellor Lalji Singh's heart, he says if there were more takers for veterinary science as compared to those for engineering and medical degrees, India's vet deficit could be bridged. The Institute of Agricultural Sciences makes myriad contributions to the agriculture, horticulture and livestock sectors of the country in an advisory capacity. The institute is the nodal centre for Agricultural Innovation Partnership under the USAID programme, which includes the universities of Cornell, Georgia, Buffalo, UC Davis, Ohio, Tuskegee, Purdue and Illinois. Closer home, the institute is renowned for developing the highest yielding basmati rice variety-'Malaviya Basmati Dhan 10-9' IET 21669-which was recommended by the Central Seed Committee. Straying from the beaten track yet again, BHU has introduced a professional MSc course in forensic science, the first of its kind in India. The online course relies on an interdisciplinary approach geared primarily towards members of the judiciary and police personnel, encompassing the disciplines of engineering, law, arts, commerce and social sciences. Launched in collaboration with Truth Labs, the first independent forensic science laboratory in India, the course delves into the intricacies of cyber forensics, crime scene investigation, polygraph reading and medico-legal consultancy, among others. Its hands-on approach to training and analytical services makes it a potentially attractive prospect for young professionals across disciplines. As for the sciences, the Department of Physics leads by example. In cognisance of its scientific merits, it was sanctioned establishment of the Tandetron Accelerator facility by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. The Bone Marrow Transplant and Stem Cell Research Centre under the Institute of Medical Sciences, slated to be completed by the end of 2014, has been envisioned as a hub of interdisciplinary research for development of new technology in the study of stem cells. An academician, guide, innovator and philanthropist rolled into one, only time will tell how BHU betters the already incredible standards it has set for itself.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Amid silence punctuated mostly by the incessant call of peacocks, the Vice-Chancellor of University of Hyderabad, Professor Ramakrishna Ramaswamy, 60, finds his art-infused office building the perfect sanctuary for everything- from planning for the forthcoming academic session to Facebooking. He is always logged into Facebook, with over 2,000 friends on his list being students. \"lt's a great way to stay connected with the students and be accessible to them. It's 'student-first' philosophy and an ethos deeply focused on research that have been consistent since 1974, when University of Hyderabad or Hyderabad Central University (HCU) was founded, drawing students from all over India and scores of foreign students too. Ramaswamy, who became the vice-chancellor in 2011, nurtures the long-term vision of expanding the student base and outreach. \"We have some excellent facilities and our faculty is among the best in the country. My vision is to make these available to an increasing number of students every year, he says. The key thing, as Ramaswamy admits, is to provide better infrastructure. \"This includes expansion of our existing facilities, improved classrooms besides better accommodation for the students. I believe that knowledge can best be shared in an environment that students find stimulating and most suitable for learning. An outstanding milestone last year was the upgrade of the university by UGC from being a University with Potential for Excellence to University of Excellence. For the vice-chancellor, a PhD in Chemistry from Princeton University, it is instances of excellent research work by students and faculty at the university that stand out. \"For instance, pursuing his integrated master's course, Nireekshan Reddy's two research papers published in prestigious international journals in the broad field of optics were truly momentous. Then the university was also in news for the three ICSSR-Amartya Sen Award recipients in the last academic year-a former student, Dr Kalpana Kanabiran who is now the director for Council for Social Development, Dr Vamsi Vakulabharanam, associate professor in the School of Economics, and a former faculty member Surinder Jodhka. With a variety of new courses in fields of sanskrit computational linguistics, cognitive sciences and earth sciences besides children's theatre and public health added in the last academic year, the university provides specialised learning opportunities. There have been other socially relevant ventures too such as the Theatre Outreach Unit started by the Department of Theatre which aims to engage with theatre practices outside institutional parameters in such a way that there is a continuous flow of knowledge and skills between academics and theatre practice. An avid blogger, Ramaswamy writes on everything from a faculty member receiving a prestigious award to the Game of Thrones on his blog-hcurocks.wordpress.com-that puns on the extensive rockscapes of the sprawling 2,000-acre campus. A nature enthusiast himself, the professor underscores the need to conserve the natural heritage of the university property. \"Based on an ISRO procured map of the university, around 600 acres is just conservation land which includes water, the natural rocks-some of which might be centuries old-and the flora and fauna including at least 45 different varieties of birds. One of the lakes is being expanded with a bund built around, which will serve as a hangout spot for the students. There is a huge portion of the campus where we do not permit any construction work because it is set aside for conservation, making the university a significant biodiversity zone of Hyderabad. There is much that is already done with the way paved for many more milestones over the next few years. \"Much depends on funding besides the policies of the new Government. It's early days and we will have to wait and see how things shape up in the months to come. Follow the writer on Twitter @Monaramavat"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story University of Calcutta isn't the kind to rest on its laurels. Last year's runner-up in the India Today-Nielsen Best Universities Survey, it has not only held on to its second spot this year but also added more feathers to its cap. It's the first non-IIT university to appear in the QS World University Rankings, 2013, beating even the fancied Delhi and Mumbai universities to secure eighth place among top varsities from India. In 2013, it was the only university from eastern India to be selected by the Ministry of Human Resource Development and UGC for its 'Connect to India' programme. \"The programme will see a tie-up between Indian and US universities and American students will be attending classes in our institutes for six to nine months, says Suranjan Das, vice-chancellor, University of Calcutta. A series of similar international collaborations and interdisciplinary programmes have contributed further to the university's growth curve. University of Calcutta was acknowledged as a \"lead institute by the World Bank for technical education. Its Institute of Foreign Policy Studies has been earmarked as a Centre for Excellence by the Ministry of External Affairs. The university is also one among 12 Indian universities chosen to participate in a new project called the Interdisciplinary Bridges for Indo-European Studies which will see collaboration between them and six European universities. The strength of the University of Calcutta lies in its meritorious faculty, many of whom have received international recognition. \"You'll see that our achievements aren't just restricted to one specific discipline but are spread across almost all disciplines be it the arts, science, law or commerce, points out Pro-VC Dhrubajyoti Chattopadhyay. Be it in modern scientific disciplines like Biotechnology where department head Koustubh Panda received the Indo-US Khorana Technology Transfer Fellowship or a more classical science like zoology, where department head and Director of Centre for Pollination Studies, Parthiba Basu, was honoured with a membership of the British Ecological Society and given a grant for his centre, University of Calcutta professors have been getting international acclaim consistently. In the field of arts too, linguist and scholar Professor Chinmoy Guha received a Knighthood of Arts and Letters from the French government. Among all the universities from BRICS countries, under QS World Rankings, the University of Calcutta was ranked 16 for its PhD studies and 71 for publishing the most number of papers per faculty in 2013. But even though academic achievements are important, the university also stresses on the all-round development of students. \"Our students, who have participated in the National Service Scheme (NSS), have received the Indira Gandhi NSS Award two years in a row,says Chatterjee. \"In sports, we have won the all-India inter-university water polo championship and have been runners-up in the all-India inter-university table tennis tournament for men in 2013, says Chatterjee. Often viewed as an archaic and old school, University of Calcutta is taking steps to modernise itself and make its curriculum more relevant to the present-day job market. The Calcutta Stock Exchange has tied up with the university to hold seminars and spread awareness about the financial market. \"Practical application of what we are studying is always very important. We need to move beyond bookish knowledge, says Anisha Banerjee, a postgraduate student of commerce in the university. The university also plans to make education accessible to all. The VC has the right to waive off all fees, including examination and even hostel fees, for students who have a BPL card. \"We have to realise that the students coming to University of Calcutta are very different from those flocking to Jadavpur or Presidency Universities. Making higher education accessible to all sections of society is our aim, says Das. A plaque in honour of Rabindranath Tagore, who had delivered a lecture to the students in 1937, is one of the prized possession of the university. \"Drive away that which enslaves your minds, that which leaves you helpless before your fate, it reads. The University of Calcutta is trying to do just that. Follow the writer on Twitter @Startingtoblue"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A lopsided battle between quantity and quality has been the defining narrative of India's higher education sector over the past decade. India is home to a staggering 694 universities that produce five million graduates. Yet it wasn't until last year, when IIT-Guwahati became the first Indian institution to be ranked in the Times Higher Education Survey's top 100 universities under 50 years old, that any could truly be rated as world class. There are signs that things are slowly improving. Seventeen Indian universities made it to the Asia Top 300 list of QS World University Rankings published this year while in the first ever QS ranking of the top 100 universities in BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries, India is represented by 16 institutions, five of them in the top 20. Increased investment in research infrastructure, skill development initiatives and foreign partnerships are some of the ways in which the country's oldest universities are revamping their academic offerings to meet international standards. But there's still a long way to go. \"Global rankings place a great deal of emphasis on research, especially interdisciplinary research. Compared to our foreign counterparts, we are still far behind in terms of the number of research papers, journals and projects published each year, says Sudhir Sopory, vice-chancellor, JNU. A study published by the Department of Science and Technology in 2010 shows that India accounted for a paltry 3.5 per cent of the global research output. China, on the other hand, accounted for 19 per cent. \"To develop a research culture, we need better funding, industry participation, infrastructure and cross-department cooperation. Personally, it has taken me almost four years to get faculty from different streams to cooperate with joint research work, adds the JNU vice-chancellor. Funding remains a major problem at university research departments across the country. University of Delhi received an estimated Rs 90 crore through various funding channels in 2013 and a total of 4,437 research papers were published by its faculty. Compared to the roughly 21,000 research papers published and Rs 773 crore spent in the same year on research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the research output by India's top university seems dismally low. \"In the US, we receive a lot of funding from industry partners. In India, however, this concept is still in its nascent stage. In public universities, it's practically non-existent. The links between Government, industry and academia need to be improved to increase funding opportunities for research, says Pradeep Khosla, chancellor of the University of California, San Diego. \"We also need more recognition for researchers during the early stages of their career. Why wait till one is 60 years old to felicitate their work? It is important to encourage and motivate youngsters in the field to continue their projects and pursue their dreams, he adds. One way that universities are looking to overcome research obstacles in the country is through MoUs with international institutions. Last year over 500 foreign agreements were signed by various colleges and departments. Each of these partnerships gave faculty and students access to resources abroad, many of which might never be found in India. \"I was overwhelmed by the level of support and interest received for my research in France. Not only did I have my own working space but I also had special laboratories and equipment booked for me. Such advanced infrastructure and conducive environment is still missing back home. This certainly needs to change, says Arnab Bose, 25, who went on a research exchange to Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, last year. His friend, Jaideep Singh, 27, agrees. Singh, who pursued a summer programme at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, was amazed by the research infrastructure in a country that isn't even a quarter the size of India. \"It is such a small place yet the dedication to innovation and creativity is unparalleled. Research guides are available round-the-clock for help and if you require special equipment, the institute goes out of its way to acquire it for you. There are no long waits or delays in funding either, says Singh. But change, it seems, is not as readily accepted at Indian universities as it might be abroad. It took three long years for University of Delhi to pilot its four-year undergraduate programme (FYUP) and two years to just gain permission for a new management building in South Campus. At Banaras Hindu University (BHU), many of the older classrooms and buildings still await approval for refurbishing. \"Of course we won't immediately be able to jump to the same level as Harvard or MIT. The academic structure is different in different countries. The process of trying something new in India is tiring, cumbersome and slow. But we are improving our standards each year, says Dinesh Singh, vice-chancellor, University of Delhi, who despite criticism still swears by his university's FYUP initiative. \"I don't think it is fair to force a student to pursue just one subject. By increasing exposure to different disciplines, you are not only building knowledge but also curiosity, he says. Skill and entrepreneurship development are two areas where new initiatives seem to move at a faster pace. Whether it's agreements with the Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises to set up incubation units at various colleges or tie-ups with the Nat- ional Skill Development Corporation for hands-on practical training exercises, Indian universities are doing a commendable job at making their students more employable.\"Nearly all of our top universities, whether public or private, boast of 80 to 90 per cent placement rates today. The problem isn't so much with educated students finding employment as it is with less fortunate students finding a seat at a university. At present, the Gross Enrolment Ratio in the country is around 20 per cent, one of the lowest in the world. This is reflective not only of the lack of encouragement for students to pursue higher education but also the lack of quality universities, says Rahul Choudaha, higher education strategist and chief knowledge officer at World Education Services. According to the latest All India Higher Survey on Higher Education by the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, private universities and colleges cater to nearly 65 per cent of the country's total student enrolment, double the number as compared to 10 years ago. \"If you notice, all top universities abroad are private ones. In India, however, many don't recognise this fact and confuse age of the university as benchmark for quality. Many private universities may only be a few years old but boast of better infrastructure, placement facilities and faculty than those that are over a hundred years old. But all said and done, mindsets are changing and students aren't as hesitant to join a private institute any more, says Suneel Galgotia, founder of the Galgotias group of institutions. This year's india today-Nielsen Best Universities Survey reflects the changing nature of higher education as universities look to innovate and break down some long-standing monopolies. While the very top spots are still occupied by public universities, six new universities have made it to the top 45. These include Tripura University, Mody University of Science and Technology, Sikar, Saurashtra University, Deccan College, Pune, Dr Harisingh Gour University, Sagar, and Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University. The survey also indicates an overall improvement in the standards of private universities with Amity University, Noida, going up from 21 to 19, BITS-Pilani from 15 to 13 and SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai, from 42 to 32. Symbiosis International University, Pune, returns to the ranking at number 30. The reign of public universities however, still continues at the top. University of Delhi claims the number one spot for the fifth year in a row while University of Calcutta remains at number two. Banaras Hindu University jumps up one spot to three, Jawaharlal Nehru University drops one spot to four and University of Hyderabad rounds up the list at number five. As with the best colleges survey, this year's results reveal a vibrant competitive environment as lesser-known universities turn to more innovative methods of teaching and research and turn the focus to making students job-ready. Their willingness to adapt to the new has forced older universities to break out of familiar territory and fight for the top spots they hold. The bar has been raised all around as is clearly reflected in India's outstanding showing in the QS BRICS survey this year. The challenge now is to break into the elite.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story I did my economics honours from Delhi's St Stephen's College between 1973 and 1976. I was clear that I would sit for the civil services exam. But those days it was very tough to score well in civil services with economics as the main subject. Students who did well in economics from the Delhi School of Economics did very poorly in the civil services examination. Therefore, I decided that I would switch over to international relations. I applied to the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and got admission in the School of International Relations (SIR); I spent two years there. Those two years were a very unique period of my life. It was a great learning experience and actually in those two years I learnt more about the world and evolved more as a person than I did during the three years in St Stephen's College. It was a fascinating experience at JNU. It was the post-Emergency period. There was a lot of vibrant politics on the campus. Many students from JNU had gone to jail. There was a lively energetic atmosphere on the campus. There were students following Left, Extreme Left and Extreme Extreme Left ideology. There used to be heady debates and discussions in the hostels, which used to start after dinner and continue till dawn. There were different shades of Marxism all over JNU. I recall attending several of those debates and greatly benefitting from them. The university used to host a number of great speakers from divergent schools of thought. There were also several active groups of free thinkers who were fully aware but not politically committed to the Left ideology. I was one among the free thinkers. The SFI was very well entrenched in the campus. I recall how Prakash Karat, Sitaram Yechuri and Jairus Banaji brought in a high level of intellectual discourse during the electioneering process. Issues of ideology, global and national politics dominated these debates. That's why the learning experience at JNU was vast and varied. Within the university, the academic circle was quite vibrant. There were some phenomenal teachers. One of the iconic teachers in the School of International Studies was Professor Ashok Guha who taught me economics. There were other doyens such as Professor Anand who taught international law, Professor S.D. Muni and Dr Pushpesh Pant. There was a whole set of outstanding teachers who helped students to learn and evolve. The quality of teaching was very high. JNU was in the old campus then. After classes, we would go to the library. Next to the library, there was a dhaba where we used to spend time debating and discussing. I used to stay in the Periyar hostel; it had an intellectually stimulating atmosphere. My sensibilities in arts, culture, dance and music evolved in JNU. JNU, in many ways, was a microcosm of India. There were students from all parts of India. The campus was very compact then. Various departments and schools were not as spread out as they are now. The students from one school used to interact with others. The meeting point was either the dhaba or the library. This is something I don't see happening now, as the different centres are located far from each other. There is very little interaction between students of different schools. As soon as I finished my masters, I sat for the civil services and I was selected. So I left JNU after two years. If I have to summarise the JNU of my time, a few things stood out -- it had outstanding faculty, the students enjoyed a lot of freedom and it had a lively and intellectually vibrant atmosphere. JNU was a great leveller, as it attracted students from a diverse milieu. The kurta-jeans culture, which students wore all the time, brought everyone down to a common denominator, making each appreciative of the others social and economic background. In fact, I made friends from varied backgrounds who have remained my friends till date. That was also a period when a lot of JNU students opted for government services with the commitment of transforming the country and doing something for the downtrodden. In fact, JNU helped students to clear the civil services because of its multidisciplinary approach. That's where JNU has an edge over others. From the same floor in my hostel one friend, Asif Ibrahim, became the director of Intelligence Bureau (IB), another, Alok Joshi, became chief of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), yet another friend, S. Jaishankar, became the foreign secretary. Several of my classmates made it to the IAS and IFS and have contributed significantly to India's growth and development. India's defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman is also a distinguished alumnus of the university. In my time, the vice chancellor, the faculty and students in JNU used to work in cohesion. Quite often, we could see the faculty and students protesting together on some national or international issue. The students used to get arrested regularly. Many of them used to be regularly taken to the Tughlaq Road police station. But the university administration and teachers always supported the students. There was no political vendetta. The VC and the faculty ran the university. It was an epitome of autonomy. I find that the cohesion of my time is missing now. Often, students are on one side, the management on another while the teachers take a different position altogether. The three components must work in close coordination. They must have a common vision on where they want to take JNU in the future. The system of selection of students in JNU has to be improved. The selection system has become very lax over a period of time. The selection must be merit-based. JNU should also start its courses only from the post-graduate level. Only in the School of Languages should they allow undergraduate courses. But the selection process needs a complete overhaul. Whatever be the situation, the university must produce the best students. They have to be best products of the Indian education system. So its very important that the quality of intake is very high and that can happen with a stringent selection process. JNU students must excel in every walk of life. JNU was designed to be a centre of great excellence. To make that happen, the focus must be on high quality research as well. There is a need for focused research and more publications from JNU. There is very little research work being done at present. The number of published research papers is very low. We must ensure that the best teachers from across the world come to JNU. It cannot remain an isolated institution living with its own ideology in its own world. The administration must ensure that students following different ideologies coexist in the university and flourish. JNU must be exposed to the worlds best universities. We must see collaborations with top universities such as Stanford, Harvard and MIT and Oxford. There was a time when BHU was perhaps the best university in India. A Tamilian, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, was appointed the VC of the university only on merit. He went on to become the President of India. Another such university was the Allahabad University, which had several outstanding teachers from South India. This meant that meritorious teachers from across the country were brought into the centres of academic excellence. The selection of teachers was purely on merit. From the mid-seventies, caste, religion and region replaced merit in the selection process. Political intervention started increasing. That resulted in many of these universities losing their old glory and legacy. The rule of merit must be brought back. If JNU has to maintain its legacy, it must improve the quality of its teachers and students. Teachers leave a huge imprint on students. We can build a secure and better future for India by selecting the right kind of teachers. Finally, JNU must work on its strength -- a multidisciplinary approach. It cannot be only about politics. We need arts, culture, music and sports to flourish too on the campus. Its many schools must emerge as the finest institutions of higher learning in the world.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A few seats of learning, through the march of history, have had the privilege of becoming symbols of collective consciousness. Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) is one of them. As a microcosm imbued with the admirable quality of diversity contained within our country, JNU is to India what Cambridge is to the UK. It has bettered its tally from last year's, moving up two places to upset last year's second spot-earner the Banaras Hindu University (BHU). JNU face widespread public ire in the aftermath of the commemoration of Afzal Guru's hanging in February this year. But with its academic credentials it has proved that good grades here aren't a casualty of activism. One of the first campuses in India to be conducive to the differently abled, JNU has a nurturing and inclusive culture. \"We have a social obligation to provide education to the most marginalised,\" says vice-chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar. \"From here on, we want to reach out to an increasing number of students who cannot afford to come to Delhi and get quality education despite being talented. We want to reach to this larger cross-section of society using technology as only campus-based education is no more feasible. We are moving towards providing online programmes.\" The distinctive quality of the campus is that students subscribing to all shades of opinions and ideologies, ranging from extreme left to right, are equally proud of the heritage of the university. It has consistently increased the ambit and numbers of disciplines in which it imparts quality education, essentially at the level of research, but also in its catchment area of a diverse student body. This is not the only survey that acknowledges its worth. In the first ever ranking of Indian universities by the government, JNU was ranked third in the National Institutional Ranking Framework, 2016. On its way to add new 'schools' and 'centres' of study, as they are called here, to its repertoire of academic excellence, a lot of thought is given to interdisciplinary harmony. In the department of science, the university is set to launch a state-of-the-art data and analytics centre. In the realm of social sciences, the university is coming up with a centre for northeastern studies, so far a field relegated to the fringes of Indian academic discourse. JNU is a mecca of sorts for free thinkers, its flourishing student culture a potpourri of fierce debate, niche cultural events, student activism, classroom excellence and insightful research. The varsity is known for its intense and dynamic political life on campus. The JNU students' union (JNUSU) is not just a representative body, but one that actively collaborates with teachers and administration in deciding on policies. The fabled JNUSU elections have acted as a model for other educational institutions to emulate. The most colourful festive event of the campus (barring the chaat sammelan on Holi) has the contestants indulge in a public debate, to which students bear witness. Interestingly, student parties cannot get posters printed: campus walls instead are an exquisite collection of hand-drawn posters and murals. The university even has a written constitution for itself. JNU takes pride in the motto of 'What India thinks tomorrow, JNU thinks today'. \"The Jawaharlal Nehru University is a campus where a student from an ordinary social and economic background can compete on equal terms with those from the top of the social and economic pyramid. It is a great leveller that imparts a sense of the banality of material life and simultaneously the high ideals of academic pursuit. That knowledge is above material acquisitions is writ large across the ethos of JNU,\" said Ritesh Rai, a PhD student from the School of International Studies (SIS). Such idealism may seem arcane today, but it has sound practical application in a campus that, for the most part, walks the talk. Rai is a case in point, he is from a backward Ghazipur district of Uttar Pradesh. The university is known for its alumni who now occupy important political and bureaucratic positions. While JNU has been dubbed a factory that supplies the country with numerous civil servants every year, one such illustrious name is that of Indian foreign secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. It also counts several leading political figures among its alumni. Some significant ones are NCP general secretary D.P. Tripathi, former Union minister Digvijay Singh, minister of state (independent charge) Nirmala Sitharaman, CPI(M) leader Prakash Karat, psephologist Yogendra Yadav and Udit Raj. Noted journalist P. Sainath is from JNU too."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Everyone who has attended the National Law School in the recent past has been confronted with this confounding question in their first year-\"What is history?\" Coming straight from school, where excelling most often meant successful rote learning of the syllabus, this question left me flummoxed. Also afraid, especially when our history professor, V.S. Elizabeth, singled me out to answer her question. I tried to put together something coherent, failed, was rightly ticked off, and went away wondering whether I had made a mistake in choosing to come to NLS. But why this moment remains with me almost 15 years hence is because it symbolised what life in NLS was about -- questioning fundamental propositions, compelling students to think originally and a culture of frankness that respected ideas, irrespective of who they came from. Much of what makes NLS great is attributable to this open culture of questioning and mutual respect. This was fostered by the student body -- anyone could pen their tho­ughts on any subject on 19(1)(a), our college notice board. As a first-year student, I could openly disagree with my seniors on anything, pro­vided I had good reason backing my argument, and senior students actively mentored junior ones. In fact, a senior who is now a close friend and an equity partner at a leading law firm, poured his heart out to me on my third day in NLS, emphasising the importance of grades (and not just moots) in law school and repenting having not taken academics seriously enough from the first year itself. The best part -- whether one had good grades or not -- one ended up with a real education that made sure we all reached somewhere in life (some better than others). This was made possible by a fantas­tic set of professors whose passion for their subjects was infectious. As in most other universities, there were better professors and worse ones, just as there were better students and worse ones. But my key takeaway from most courses I took in NLS, whether it be arcane rules of inheritance in Muslim personal law to the Supreme Court's odd conflation of arbitrariness and equality in Article 14 of the Constitution, was that the study of law was a study of politics and power. Law, NLS taught me, is a legitimising instrument of state power designed to serve very specific, often majoritarian, interests. Just like it is necessary to have law to bring order and uniformity, concurrently time it is necessary to challenge it as being unfair, unjust or discriminatory. Both the study of law and its questioning went hand in hand at NLS. While I'm delighted that NLS has once again retained prime spot in the national rankings, the same principles that have propelled it to the top spot require me to maintain a healthy sce­pticism of its achievement. It is a matter of considerable regret, not only for NLS, but also for India, that despite being India's premier law school, it is not anywhere close to being the world's best. Its journals are good without being great, publications by its faculty are limited and its students are still largely focu­sed on landing high-paying corporate jobs instead of charting new frontiers. It is time NLS stops resting on its laurels of being India's best law school and aspires to be one of the world's top five law schools. I set this target advisedly since, having spent five years after NLS at the University of Oxford, truly one of the world's best universities, I am confident this is achievable. For this to happen, NLS must start with four fundamental changes. Though some might be provocative, I fir­mly believe true greatness requires swallowing some bitter pills. First, the government must declare NLS as an institution of national importance. The leading law school in the country must be constantly engaged in furthering its quest for research excellence, and not get bogged down by petty politics over state and regional quotas. Second, it must exit the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT). Though CLAT does a great job of reducing the number of examinations for students, the level of testing aptitude and reasoning in it is simply not good enough to attract the world's best future law­yers. A more concise, carefully pre­p­ared, reasoning-based test must be considered for NLS to attract the best talent. Third, no institution has achieved greatness without welcoming its alumni back as faculty. NLS has a mixed record in this respect -- while many wonderful students have taught and now teach at NLS, their number could be far more. Every great law school in the world is built on the strength of its students who later become its professors. NLS must do better in this regard. Fourth, to be among the world's best, there is a constant need to publish high-quality journal articles. This cul­ture must be led by the faculty. Not only is there a need to attract good faculty from the world over but also to free up time for them to publish and not just teach and mark papers and projects. Calibrating student body size and having an opti­mal faculty-student ratio is critical to this. At the same time, as a former editor of the National Law School of India Review, I am aware of the tremendous potential we have in producing a high-quality law review. However, the nature of the legal profession in India is such that, with a few notable exceptions, academic publications scarcely have real-world impact. NLS must be at the forefront of changing this status quo by not only bringing out high quality law reviews but also translating such research into real-world impact by intervening in courts, filing public interest litigations etc. As a proud alumnus, I am cognizant that the vision I've laid out for my alma mater, particularly regarding fostering a culture of research excellence, can equally be a realistic vision for any law school in India. To propel this, the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, where I am research director, is currently in the process of establishing a Vidhi Society in each law school to inculcate the ethos of law and public policy research in law students. I end on a personal note. During my time at NLS, we were accustomed to hearing that the school considered itself a 'Harvard of the East'. Nothing irked me more than this. When Professor Madhava Menon started NLS, there was a vision of creating lawyers as social engineers. It was an original vision, true to what India needed of its lawyers and legal academics, not a faithful copy of a great American institution. It is time to return to that original vision and make it real for the 21st century. That can only happen when the vision we lay out for ourselves is an original one, derived from our own de facto anthem at NLS -- 'Where Knowledge is Free'. Free knowledge will not only make NLS a Harvard of the East, but the pride of India and a model for other universities in the global South to follow.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story I joined the All India Institute of Medical Sciences or AIIMS as an undergraduate student in the summer of 1981. Having studied in the already rather competitive environment of a Delhi school -- the first thing that hit me was that nearly everyone in a class of 50 students at AIIMS was a school \"topper\"! It really could not have got more intense than that -- and I think that one of the key ingredients in making AIIMS an outstanding academic environment is some exceptionally smart kids spurring each other in their individual pursuits of professional excellence. While each of these students may have had a different approach in the way they set about preparing for a future as a healthcare professional -- the common theme was their commitment to the cause and their ability to work exceptionally hard. AIIMS has a semester system for undergraduate education, with mid and end semester examinations, and end-posting clinical assessments being an integral part of a continuing assessment process. Hence, there never was a time to take the foot off the accelerator, and the process of education continued unabated without any \"down time\" for knowledge or skill acquisition. This relentless work ethic got ingrained into our DNA -- and I think has helped all of us become good doctors. When there is a sick individual you have to care for, you do not have the luxury of taking your eye off the ball; it is only your enduring commitment and unwavering focus that serve you and your patient well. Needless to say, we were mentored by some real stars in the medical firmament. Several of our faculty were not only well regarded in the country, but were also internationally renowned, having contributed significantly to medical literature. It is always inspiring to find contributions from your teachers in the medical textbooks you are being taught from. These were people who had, with their exceptional clinical skills, identified problems, evaluated the factors contributing to their evolution and provided therapeutic solutions. In a recent exhibition we organised on the occasion of the AIIMS Diamond Jubilee, we put together examples of the seminal contributions of the AIIMS faculty over the previous 60 years. A perusal of these exhibits made it evident that several of India's key clinical and public health programmes stemmed from technical contributions from AIIMS -- a matter of immense pride for all of us. This approach to the functioning of a medical institution has been passed down the generations -- and is one of our core values. Making the transition from a trainee doctor to a faculty member at AIIMS, I carried these core values along with me. The first thing one realises is that we are faced with a vast body of medical literature, and it is impossible to know everything! In the interest of our patients, it is imperative to challenge existing dogma, read and critically analyse current literature, and seek advice and guidance from those who are more skilled and experienced in specific domains! There is no shame in accepting one's limitations -- and work towards acquiring fresh knowledge to be put in use for the care of your patients. I believe that I have never held back in seeking and accepting advice from others -- seniors, peers and even trainees -- as long as it was logical, rational and backed by evidence. This is necessary for the incremental growth of a professional -- and once I again believe that AIIMS has enabled and supported me as a faculty member to follow this path of maturing into a more seasoned healthcare professional. The AIIMS trinity-patient care, education and research -- has been the bulwark on which the institutional foundation is established. Each contributes to the development of the other -- patient care is never dealt with in isolation. We learn from our experience in managing each patient to improve the care of subsequent patients. Clinical and public health observations on many occasion trigger a line of questioning which evolves into contextually relevant research -- not merely to understand the contributors to disease, but also to find solutions for the problem-at individual and societal levels. The opportunity to interact with colleagues across disciplines, and utilise their skill sets and competencies to help address complex problems is once again a part of the AIIMS ethos. We understand that while individual brilliance is important, the cumulative consultative competence of a team combining their efforts to work towards a common goal is often what makes all the difference. The institution encourages you to think, challenges you to take on new problems and celebrates your success. The public perception about AIIMS is driven by its contribution to patient care. Sometimes we forget that this excellence in patient care is combined with our track record in education and biomedical research. The very fact that this article is being written is because of our standing as India's top institution for medical education. Independent bibliometric analysis has unequivocally demonstrated that AIIMS is India's top institution for biomedical research. And a third set of \"league tables\" ranks us as the best institution for patient care. It is difficult enough to be at the top of the tables in one domain, but to do so, and that too consistently ever since these league tables were established, across all measured domains, is a sign of institutional strength and a testimony to the effort put in by several generations of faculty, students, researchers and staff. I think this multi-dimensional role for AIIMS needs more acknowledgement and recognition and also the necessary support-administrative and financial, to bolster its place as an institution of national importance and a beacon of hope for the millions of economically disadvantaged ailing individuals who throng its portals in the unflinching belief and hope that this is the place where they receive succour and a resolution of their medical problems. Hence, we need to make every effort to not only enhance patient care facilities in the narrow sense, but also strengthen resources for both education and research-because, together, these facets weave a complex thread to make the tapestry of patient care strong and scientifically appropriate. As I close this piece, a personal observation about the way forward. I have seen over the years the immense pressures faced by all in their efforts to deliver their responsibilities-may it be patient care, teaching or research. The quantum of time and effort demanded by our patient care service clearly impinges on our ability to teach and research. But, even more importantly, there is to some extent a mismatch between the spectrum of patients attending AIIMS for treatment and the available skill set and infrastructure. To explain this further, at least the government health system has been designed to be multi-tiered-with primary, secondary and tertiary care institutions. AIIMS, by all definitions, was created as a referral tertiary care institution. However, a not insignificant proportion of patients attending the outpatient facilities at AIIMS suffer from ailments which can be easily and appropriately managed by colleagues in secondary care institutions. This also means that several individuals with more complex problems, which cannot be managed elsewhere due either to the limited availability of such facilities or the attendant costs in private health care institutions, are not being able to access the facilities at AIIMS. My plea would be to look at strategies to implement the referral linkages between primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities such that we best align patient requirements with available health infrastructure in government healthcare facilities. This will help streamline patient care and also enable those with more complex health problems obtain the necessary treatment from tertiary care institutions such as AIIMS. The AIIMS I have grown with is exemplified by three Es: Erudition (in medical knowledge and research), Excellence (in patient care and public health) and Empathy (for the ailing individual). I hope that we sustain our efforts in this regard and continue relentlessly on this wonderful journey called AIIMS.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Miles of corridors snake down the middle of each floor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi. If you walk down these neon-lit corridors, you'll come across closed doors on each side, sporting nameplates of doctors and departments, occasional academic posters on bright beige walls and, of course, brusque signboards: \"Medical representatives NOT welcome.\" On most weekdays, the sound of your footsteps will reverberate down these quiet and tidy walkways. These are the corridors of knowledge, the academic arena within which students learn from their teachers the ways of the human body-how it works, what makes it tick. Further down the corridors, an unsavoury smell hangs in the air: the stench of disease. The temple of knowledge loses its way into a teeming mass of humanity, spilling over from every side. This is the out-patient department, where every day, over 4,000 people-ill, unwell or injured-throng the passages, a Rs 10 coupon in hand, and besiege the doctors. They wait for hours on uncomfortable wooden benches till their turn comes. In their little chambers, the doctors toil away, perfectly aware that for most of their patients, they are the last resort of hope. Dr Amlesh Seth, surgeon of urology, smiles: \"It's a great learning experience. Where else would students get to see such a wide range of patients and diseases?\" What makes a university great? That's the question to ask in this season of rankings. Is it one that matches academic credentials with stunning surroundings? In a World Bank report on what makes the best of the best universities, education economist Jamil Salmi writes that a high concentration of talented teachers, researchers and students distinguish top universities from their competitors. But every ranking of universities, globally, suffers from a problem: who will measure the quality of teaching in technical fields and how will the impact be quantified? The annual college rankings by the US News & World Report ignores 'intangibles', such as 'faculty dedication to teaching'. The Times Higher Education rankings have tried to solve the issue by measuring reputational questions on teaching, teacher-student ratios and so on. Let us consider AIIMS: if about 9 per cent of nearly 6 lakh students who take the All India Pre-Medical/Pre-Dental Entrance Test (AIPMT, now NEET) exams get into a medical college, just 0.67 per cent of the 1 lakh students who take the AIIMS entrance exam every year are able to clear it. With manpower of over 10,000 people, including 826 faculty, over 700 scholars in various courses, 800-plus postgraduate trainees and fellows, it enjoys a very high student-teacher ratio of 1:1.2 overall. \"The philosophy, ethics and patient management that our students get trained in cannot be found anywhere else,\" says Dr G.K. Rath, chief of the Dr B.R. Ambedkar Institute-Rotary Cancer Hospital at AIIMS. \"In the last 10 years, the number of people applying for teaching posts here has gone up 10 times. Senior people from other hospitals take up junior posts, just to be in AIIMS.\" Another factor that sets top universities apart is their sizeable budget, reports the World Bank task force on higher education: elite institutions have higher funding for impressive facilities, good infrastructure, operational spending and research. \"All these are vital part of the educational experience of students,\" says Dr M.C. Misra, Director, AIIMS. As the premier-most brand, AIIMS has the largest budget sanctioned by the Indian state: Rs 1,000 crore for planned allocation and Rs 1,043 crore for non-plan in 2016. \"An encouraging move,\" says Misra. AIIMS has already started the process of hiring 100 faculty members and 1,000 nurses to further boost the institution, he points out. New projects are coming up: from expansion plans for the AIIMS?Emergency block and Trauma Centre to new OPD blocks and a mother and childcare unit. A significant focus area is research. About 1,100 annual publications is what AIIMS produces a year, ranking third in a review of the world's largest database of peer-reviewed literature in the world, reports Current Medicine Research and Practice, April 2016, right after Massachusetts General Hospital and Mayo Clinic in the US. World-class universities invariably thrive in an ecosystem that fosters creativity, competitiveness and critical thinking. Flagship universities in North America and Europe are known for successfully combining freedom, autonomy and leadership. Jawaharlal Nehru's dream institute, set up to foster a scientific culture in modern India in 1956 by an Act of Parliament, AIIMS has been an autonomous body under the Union ministry for health right from the beginning. It is not answerable to clunky bureaucracy and externally imposed standards. As a result, with its small student body of the brightest and most motivated young minds from around the country, the institution has been able to experiment with its unique model of curriculum and mode of learning: from modern, interactive, small-group teaching to problem-based learning, allowing students the lead time to spend more hours in anatomy classes, experiment with new teaching tools such as ultrascope, video-instruction systems, MRIs, CTs, X-Rays, ultrasonograms, e-learning and digital technology-breathing new life into the lecture theatre. But you will never understand what AIIMS means unless you are a patient there. Take Dr Seth, for instance. Even his daily surgeries tantamount to sessions with students. And even patients, if they are not on general anaesthesia, can follow what is going on. As Nirmal Joshi, 78, a patient with initial stage cancer in the urinary bladder, says, \"I saw my entire procedure on the screen in front of me. What's more, with the doctor explaining to several of his students helping him in the OT, I understood the entire experience fully.\" It did not just distract him during the procedure, explains his wife, it also made him more positive during the healing process, post-surgeries. So is it the beauty of a strong leadership team, a well-thought-out curriculum, qualified academicians and meritorious students? \"AIIMS certainly provides some of that, but what makes it great as an institution is its ability to take the hard road when the chips are down,\" says Dr Misra. \"Here, the only thing we are interested in is making AIIMS a true place of learning.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Arecent report by consultancy major Accenture estimates that India's systematic skill gap will potentially result in a loss of approximately $1.97 trillion (Rs 1,37,57,000 crore) in 'opportunity costs'. This means India will lose roughly two-thirds of its current GDP between 2018 and 2028. On the positive side, though, as Vice-president M. Venkaiah Naidu said last month, rapid industrialisation and economic growth will create opportunities for a 250 million-strong skilled workforce by 2030. This, in turn, will enable India to emerge as a global supplier of skilled manpower. And college education, across multiple streams, will have a pivotal role in unlocking this potential. The India Today Group's annual college survey has for the past two decades authentically reflected the state and progress of the country's colleges. The 23rd edition of the college special continues that tradition. Like last year, the survey was conducted by Marketing and Development Research Associates (MDRA), a reputed Delhi-based market research agency, across 14 streams-arts, science, commerce, medical, dental, engineering, architecture, law, mass communication, hotel management, BBA, BCA, fashion and social work. Conducted between November 2018 and April 2019, 1,207 colleges participated this year, up from 988 last year. While undergraduate courses were evaluated across 12 streams, postgraduate courses were considered for mass communication and social work. Factoring in this apprehension over the high cost of education, colleges have been ranked on another parameter this year-with the lowest tuition fee. This is in addition to the return on investment (RoI) ranking of colleges. The RoI rankings aren't an indication of best colleges, just of the maximum return offered in terms of salaries offered against course fee charged. From the point of view of investment in college education, they are the most valuable. Significantly, and disturbingly, this year's rankings confirm a trend that has become regular over the past few years-most of the top colleges are concentrated in a few big cities, with the national capital region of Delhi leading the pack. That explains the incredibly high cut-offs in Delhi University colleges and the nerve-wracking competition among students from across the country to secure a seat in a college of their choice. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has given it a political colour this Lok Sabha election, by demanding reservation for locals in Delhi colleges. What sets the top colleges apart? India Today correspondents spoke to the heads of these institutes and a number of students to decipher the secret of their excellence. The answers were strikingly similar, explaining that the road to top is an eternal endeavour. There is no room for complacency; innovation is the way forward. \"When students come here, they are good but we try to take them to a level where their skills and subject knowledge are enhanced,\" says Professor John Varghese, the principal of St Stephen's College, which has topped the arts stream six times in the past 23 years. At the Shri Ram College of Commerce, which has remained on top in commerce since the survey began, the focus is on holistic growth. \"We adopt a very good methodology in creating holistic development of a student,\" says Simrit Kaur, its principal. Another yet-to-be-dethroned champion is the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, which not only produces the country's best doctors but also functions as a live laboratory of medical practices and management. With its massive footfall, it offers its students hands-on experience that few colleges in India can dream of. \"We get to watch some of the best clinician-researchers in action, having plenty of opportunity to go out and explore,\" says Lajjaben Jayesh Kumar Patel, an MBBS student. Yet director Randeep Guleria feels he has much more to do-from setting up new courses and departments to introducing digital governance. It's this drive to explore new horizons that has kept the Bengaluru-based National Law School of India University at the top 17 times since 1998. The alma mater of several top legal minds of the country, NLSIU, like toppers in other streams, also focuses on instilling value-based education. As Professor S.N. Venkata Rao, its vice-chancellor, explains, the success is the result of innovation in teaching, socially relevant themes and making legal education justice-oriented. That can be achieved when freedom to think and express is allowed and that's what makes the institute unique. \"I don't think any other institute promotes such free thinking. Each student gets exposure to all facets of life apart from academics,\" says Chandni Ochani, a final-year student pursuing a BA-LLB.(Hons) programme. While most of the table toppers are a perfect blend of hard work and legacy, geography and economics often play a critical role in earning excellence. There is a disparity in the distribution of funds as 65 per cent of the University Grants Commission budget is utilised by central universities and their colleges while state universities and their affiliated colleges get only 35 per cent. It's not just coincidence that colleges under DU-a central university-are regular toppers in our survey. This lopsided spending apart, India's expenditure on higher education as a percentage of its total budget has remained stagnant, hovering at an average 1.5 per cent over the past 12 years. The task, then, is cut out for the new government that takes over on May 23: pump in more funds, improve infrastructure and quality of higher education and hold stakeholders accountable. Indians are more constrained by the circumstances they are born in than the citizens of five other large developing countries-Brazil, China, Egypt, Indonesia and Nigeria, according to a 2018 World Bank report. Government initiatives, therefore, will be crucial in scripting a turnaround. HOW THE COLLEGES WERE RANKED India's higher education is highly competitive, with over 37 million students studying across about 50,000 institutes of higher education. For the past two decades, india today's Best Colleges Survey has become a friend, guide and ready reckoner to all those students who have to make the challenging decision of what to study and where. The 23rd edition of this annual exercise, the survey was conducted in association with Delhi-based reputed market research agency Marketing & Development Research Associates (MDRA) between November 2018 and April 2019. Colleges were ranked across 14 streams-arts, science, commerce, medical, dental, engineering, architecture, law, mass communication, hotel management, BBA, BCA, fashion and social work. During objective ranking, MDRA carefully attuned 112-plus attributes in each stream (performance indicators) to provide the most comprehensive and balanced comparisons of colleges in their respective streams. These performance indicators were clubbed into five broad parameters-'Intake Quality & Governance', 'Academic Excellence', 'Infrastructure & Living Experience', 'Personality & Leadership Development' and 'Career Progression & Placement'. Moreover, to give more realistic, relevant and updated information, MDRA has evaluated colleges based on current year data. The ranking tables also give parameter-wise scores obtained by colleges to provide deeper insights on key aspects of decisionmaking by various stakeholders. The ranking was done in multiple steps: > An extensive desk review of MDRA's database and secondary research was conducted to prepare a list of colleges in each stream. Only those colleges, which have been offering full-time, in-classroom courses and churned out at least three pass-out batches till academic year 2018-19, were considered. In 12 streams, undergraduate courses were ranked. In Mass Communication and Social Work, postgraduate courses were evaluated. While the participation form inviting every eligible college to participate was put up in public domain, around 10,000 colleges fulfilling the criteria were directly contacted. > Experts with rich experience in their fields were consulted to frame the parameters and sub-parameters for different streams. Indicators critical for establishing best colleges were meticulously determined and their relative weights were finalised. > Comprehensive objective questionnaires were designed for each of the 14 streams taking into account these performance indicators and were put up in public domain-on the websites of india today and MDRA. The MDRA team directly contacted about 10,000 colleges fulfilling the eligibility criteria seeking objective data for verification. Attested hard copies and soft copies were sought and 1,207 eligible institutes submitted institutional data along with voluminous supporting documents within the stipulated deadline. > After receipt of the objective data from participating colleges, MDRA verified the information provided by them. In case of insufficient/incorrect data, respective colleges were asked to provide complete, correct and updated information. > Physical audits (verification) were conducted to verify the objective data provided by the colleges. Experienced researchers of MDRA visited 138 colleges and thoroughly examined each aspect of the details provided by them. Corrections were made wherever required. > Perceptual survey about these colleges was carried out among 1,787 well-informed respondents (560 senior faculty members, 291 recruiters/ professionals, 381 career accelerators and 555 final-year students) across 24 cities. North: Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram, Faridabad, Lucknow, Kota, Chandigarh and Ludhiana West: Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Indore and Nagpur South: Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi and Coimbatore East: Kolkata, Bhubaneswar, Guwahati, Patna and Raipur National and zonal rankings were taken from them in their respective field of experience and were given 75 per cent and 25 per cent weightages, respectively. They also rated the institutes on a 10-point rating scale on each of the five key parameters. > While computing objective scores, it was ensured that aggregate data alone is not used and hence data were normalised for fair comparison. The total scores arrived from objective and perceptual survey were added in the ratio of 60:40-for 11 professional courses-while a ratio of 50:50 was taken for academic courses-arts, science and commerce-to get the final combined score. The MDRA core team, led by Abhishek Agrawal (Executive Director), consisted of Abnish Jha (Associate Project Director), Rajan Chauhan (Research Executive) and Manveer Singh (Executive-EDP)."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Vijay Sheel Nayakar, a student at the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC), is yet to receive his diploma for completing his nine-month-long advertising and public relations (AD & PR) course, but he already has a job offer from the Ministry of AYUSH. Nayakar, however, wishes to work with the india today Group, but can't apply to other companies till his batchmates have been placed. Till now, the Delhi institute has achieved 85 per cent placement. That’s the kind of support an IIMC student can enjoy. The institute is the most-sought-after among aspiring media students. Nayakar, though a student of advertising, can hope to join a news group because students here receive 360-degree training. Our students acquire skillsets to work across media platformsprint, radio, TV and digital. They are trained to handle any aspect of mass communication, says Professor Gita Bamezai, who is Dean (academics) and head of the Communication Research department. Last year, IIMC pass-outs were offered an average annual salary of Rs 13 lakh. The duration of the course, however, is likely to change soon as the ministry of human resource development has issued a letter of intent to declare IIMC a deemed university, which will enable it to grant degrees instead of just diplomas. Currently, IIMC functions under the ministry of information and broadcasting. The IIMC Society, an autonomous body registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1867, runs the institute. Inaugurated on August 17, 1965, it started with a small staff, including a couple of consultants from UNESCO. In its early years, it organised training courses for the Central Information Service Officers and conducted small-scale research studies. In 1969, it launched an international training programme for mid-level journalists from Afro-Asian countries. Eventually, it also launched several specialised short courses, lasting anywhere between a week and three months, to meet the training needs of communication professionals in private and public sectors. Now, IIMC offers postgraduate diplomas in print journalism in various languages, radio and TV journalism, apart from AD & PR. Over time, IIMC has consistently retained its enviable reputation as a centre of excellence in the arena of communication teaching, training and research. It has not only expanded its infrastructureit now has six centres in Delhi, Dhenkanal, Aizawl, Kottayam, Amaravati and Jammubut also academic activities, introducing a number of specialised courses to cover the rapidly expanding media and communication industry. The syllabus is reviewed annually to keep it relevant. The focus is to get industry experts to teach here. For instance, 70 per cent of the training in the AD & PR department was done by industry experts, says Anubhuti Yadav, head of the department of New Media. The courses offered by the institute represent a meaningful blend of classroom teaching, supplemented by rigorous exercises, lab journals and field visits. These differentiate the students’ training from that of other institutes. For instance, this year, students participated in live campaigns of the ministry of railways and Facebook, says Yadav. In 2018, an IIMC student spent an average of 200 hours on fieldwork. One of the areas where IIMC has lately been focusing on is journalism in regional languages. Most digital platforms are primarily restricted to the English language, but the next big scope is in regional languages, where IIMC already has an edge. Apart from English and Hindi, we have courses in Odiya, Malayalam, Marathi and Urdu, says Bamezai. It has also tied up with the Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha for a certificate course in Sanskrit journalism. IIMC recently introduced a new course on Indian communication theories included in Bharat Muni’s Natya Shastra, an ancient treatise on the performing arts. The aim is to teach students India’s ancient past, contemporary history and its transition to a democracy. The information technology revolution has not only expanded the scope of journalism, but also changed its contour. Video and social media together have broadened journalism’s scope, but have also given rise to the menace of fake news. As the premier media institute of the country, IIMC recognises this unwarranted development and has held several workshops on how to counter the crisis of fake news. Our training also has a goal to impart a sense of responsibility among the students and make them aware of ethical considerations, so that they can play a constructive role in a multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-ethnic society. It’s what makes IIMC students stand out, says Bamezai. This thinking keeps IIMC true to its philosophy since its inceptionto define the perspective with which to approach communication to bring about change and development. Guruspeak: K. Ganesan, Director-General, IIMC What sets IIMC apart? IIMC is one of the oldest institutes.It has highly qualified faculty members who design the courses in collaboration with industry experts. New initiatives in the past three years Apart from language courses, we have embraced new technologies, like artificial intelligence, immersive and data journalism. What’s next? We have received a letter of intent from UGC for a deemed university status. We are alsp planning to start a course on new media from the next academic year. What’s unique about the IIMC campus? The campus is isolated from the hustle and bustle of Delhi and is one of the greenest campuses in India. The work environment teaches us the virtue of teamwork and patience. We experience a professional environment even before joining the industry. Why I love my teachers They go above and beyond when it comes to our welfare. They become our mentors in personal and professional spheres. We feel secure and confident with them around. One thing I want to change The bureaucratic slow pace."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The primary focus at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)- Delhi is to encourage a culture of entrepreneurship and research, right from the BTech to the PhD level. \"IIT-Delhi probably has the country's best developed ecosystem for entrepreneurship,\" says V. Ramgopal Rao, the institute's director. \"Of the 21 unicorns built by IITians, 11 are by Delhi IITians. In the past two years, we have also invested close to Rs 100 crore in revamping the experimental facilities for research at the campus.\" To encourage the spirit of entrepreneurship among the faculty as well, India's top-ranked engineering college has started a weekly initiative called Faculty Innovation and Research Entrepreneurship (FIRE), where faculty members who wish to turn their research work into a start-up can work on their projects, which would be funded by the institute. IIT-Delhi has emerged as the country's strongest provider of highly employable graduates, as per the QS Graduate Employability Rankings, 2018. To add to the new initiatives taken in the past couple of years, IIT-Delhi, traditionally known for offering only degree programmes, has now been approved to offer diploma courses to working professionals in areas such as artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, keeping in tune with industry needs. Jashan Singh Suri, who is pursuing a dual degree in the department of biochemical engineering and biotechnology, says, \"The campus is often visited by multinational companies from fields such as finance, business and consulting, giving students who wish to switch their careers from engineering an array of opportunities.\" Another step has been the establishment of a new Centre for Automotive and Research Tribology (CART), with the institute spending up to Rs 20 crore initially. \"We want to develop resources for industries in terms of vehicle technologies and components focused on electric vehicles,\" says Rao. One thing that both the students and the institute's director vouch for is the overall personal development that one goes through at IIT-Delhi. \"There is a competitive environment, freedom to pursue one's chosen career path, well-established clubs as well as facilities for extracurricular and recreational activities, such as sports, music and dance,\" says Suri. Rao adds, \"There are students' clubs that let them opt for diverse activities and nurture different aspects of their development. We have a strong alumni network (about 50,000) and many of them are connected with the students on campus.\" Rao, however, rues land constraint at the institute. \"IIT-Delhi is spread across 300 acres. Being situated in south Delhi, we are a land-locked campus. We have grown by 50 per cent in terms of students and faculty in the past seven years, so we have written to the housing and urban affairs ministry to grant us land in Delhi to come up with an extension campus,\" informs Rao. Last year, IIT-Delhi set up its extension campus in Sonipat, housing three science and technology parks. Way to go! What sets IIT-Delhi apart? IIT-Delhi probably has the best ecosystem for entrepreneurship. Of the 21 unicorns by IITians, 11 are from IIT-Delhi. In the past two years, the institute has invested close to Rs 100 crore on revamping the experimental facilities for research. What new initiatives have been taken in the past three years? We have started the Faculty Interdisciplinary Research Project (FIRP) through which our faculty can work with the faculties of institutions in India or abroad. We have signed MoUs with the AIIMS, All India Institute of Ayurveda and the Indian Council for Agricultural Research even as discussions are on with some US universities. We have also started the 'Discover and Learn (1-2-3-4) Project' in which students, in groups of four, work on research projects under the supervision of a faculty member. The projects are funded by the institute. Fifty such groups have already been formed. There's the Platform for Harnessing Deep Technologies under which PhD students can turn their ideas into start-ups. On the curriculum front, IIT-Delhi has started offering diploma programmes to working professionals in areas such as artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. A new Centre for Automotive and Research Tribology (CART) has been established, with an initial expense of Rs 20 crore. We want to develop resources for industries in terms of vehicle technologies and components focused on electric vehicles One thing I want to improve in my institute IIT-Delhi is spread across 300 acres, and being situated in south Delhi, we are a land-locked campus. The institute has grown by 50 per cent in terms of student and faculty strength in the past seven years. So we have written to the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs to grant us land elsewhere in Delhi to be come up with an extension campus. Why I chose IIT-Delhi IIT-Delhi is the top engineering college in the country. Multinational companies from across fields, such as finance, business and consulting, visit the campus, offering an array of opportunities to students who wish to switch their career from engineering. What's unique about campus life at IIT-Delhi? Being located in the heart of south Delhi, the campus is extremely accessible in terms of lodging and transportation. There are no restrictions for men and women. The students council and administration have ensured this independence to all students. The highly qualified and motivated faculty members mentor the students in a competitive environment."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In the last two years, university campuses have emerged as the political nerve centres of the country. Down south, Rohith Vemula's suicide on the University of Hyderabad campus brought the ugly undercurrents of caste and religious fault lines to the fore. In Delhi, Jawaharlal Nehru University became a battle zone between the followers of two conflicting ideologies. The debate veered from the sanctity of autonomy of educational institutes to fixing the maximum age for a PhD student in a university. But the first big battle, where the central government and the authorities of a university came in direct conflict was faced by Delhi University, the topper in 2016 India Today Group's best universities study, conducted by the Nielsen Company. A visionary vice chancellor's endeavour to introduce radical reforms in the curriculum and duration of courses was curbed mid-plan by the Union government, thanks to pressure mounted in unison-perhaps for the first time in India's history-by educationists, teachers and students, both right- and left-wing. Despite these unsavoury episodes, both DU and JNU did not lose sight of the objective they had set out for themselves. The political hullabaloo did not halt DU's quest for maintaining its numero uno status in the country, a position that has remained unchallenged for the last four years. JNU has left open the debate whether it's the ultimate custodian of free speech or a bastion of anti-national elements, but quietly jumped from No. 5 position last year to second position this year. This year, the study has introduced three new categories-medical, technical and law-to differentiate domain-specific universities from the general ones offering courses in the three main streams-arts, science and commerce. There has been a change in the methodology as well. This year, we have considered only perceptual data because of non-availability of actual data for all universities in the same time frame. This change also explains the dominance of government universities in every category despite a tremendous growth in privately-owned institutes. Several experts even attribute the expansion of the higher education sector in the last two decades to the contribution of the private sector. The number of universities in India has increased from 20 in 1950 to 757 in 2015, of which 267 are privately managed. The gross enrolment ratio in higher education has seen a steep climb between 2001-02 and 2013-14 from 8.1 per cent to 23.6 per cent. The reason behind this surge is the rise of the private sector, which now accounts for over 60 per cent of enrolment in higher education. Yet, in public perception, the quality of education in private sector has remained debatable. \"Of course the growth in enrolment has been more than expected but private universities have played a big role in this. There is no doubt that at many stages quality has been compromised,\" says Sachidanand Sinha, professor, Centre for the Study of Regional Development, JNU. He was one of the members of the committee which in 2008 submitted a report on Higher Education in India, dealing with issues related to expansion, inclusiveness, quality and finance. Sinha points towards lack of quality teachers even in government-funded universities of repute. In 2014, the teacher pupil ratio in universities and colleges was 24 compared to 14 in the United States and 18 in the UK. \"The country's best university and colleges under it have over 5,000 vacancies. In several private universities, especially in the technical institutes, most names in the faculty list are fake. One teacher could be teaching in 10 institutes,\" says Sinha. All eyes are now set on the Union ministry for human resource development, which is now in the process of formulating the new education policy. The T.S.R. Subramanian Committee, which was formed to make the framework for the education policy has already submitted its report. The HRD ministry has recently taken a few corrective steps to clear certain administrative bottlenecks in university education. For instance, it announced rules to make granting of deemed university status much faster. It also made foreign university collaborations easier for colleges and varsities. In fact, a NITI Aayog report suggests that the government allow foreign universities to set up campuses in India. Such collaborations could be a welcome step, but the government still has to get its basics right. As Sinha points out, good education depends not on buildings of brick and mortar but on the teachers. The quality of education in both private and government sectors is incumbent on a move to produce better teachers in numbers that can fill up vacancies."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Nestled in the heart of south Delhi, Jamia Millia Islamia's history as a central university goes back to India's pre-Independence era. Founded in 1920 by the Ali brothers, Moulana Mohammad Ali Jouhar and Moulana Shaukat Ali, Jamia Millia Islamia is today home to over 23,000 students pursuing a variety of courses at its sprawling, picturesque campus. Spotting the university is never a problem even for newbies. Blue signboards on the nearby arterial roads guide you. The Faculty of Law building is far inside the campus, roughly a 10-minute walk. As you arrive, the very first impressions are inviting: marble benches, lush green trees on both sides of the road, food joints offering momos, sandwiches and cold drinks. Adjacent to the MMAJ Academy of International Studies, the law department shares its building with the Centre for Management Studies. Compared to the university's nine-decade-old history, the law faculty is a much recent entity. Established in 1989, it has, over the past two decades, made significant progress-restructuring courses and syllabi, introducing new courses, experimenting with innovative teaching techniques and strengthening its programmes. The faculty offers a five-year integrated BA LLB (Honours) programme, a two-year post-graduate programme (LLM) in three specialised streams (personal law, corporate law and criminal law) and a PhD programme. Step into the classroom and you feel it's been custom-made to accommodate only a small number of students. \"Unlike many private universities, we don't shove hundreds of students into our classrooms,\" says Dr Nuzhat Khan, dean, law faculty. \"We have a dedicated number of enrollments in each course and the students are made to feel comfortable in the classroom.\" The classrooms are air-conditioned, have comfortable seating and are equipped with the latest teaching tools. Apart from the university's central library, the law department has a separate library, with abundant reading material for its students. Like every department in Jamia Millia, the law faculty has a strict attendance policy. Every student has to maintain a minimum of 75 per cent attendance (even a 0.1 per cent shortfall will bar you from sitting in the semester/annual exams). The university is also zero-tolerant toward ragging. Any such incident can invite immediate expulsion. Step outside the classroom and you will realise why Jamia Millia is considered a food haven. There are multiple canteens and food joints in the campus. Youth Cafe and Maggie Point are the first picks of the students. From regular chicken sandwiches to chhole bhature, the canteens serve fresh, delicious food. And on the days you are in the mood to try authentic Mughlai food, just do the five-minute walk to the central university's canteen. On offer are chicken biryani and quorma roti, and also chhole bhature, rajma chawal, kadhi chawal and some intercontinental dishes. And all at a very reasonable price. \"I chose the Faculty of Law as I wanted an experience-based learning, and by the end of my five years in the department, I was proven right,\" says Sahil Ahmad, a 2015 law faculty alumnus. \"I am still in touch with my professors, and they continue to guide me through my preparations for the forthcoming judiciary exams.\" Sahil was one of the core members of the moot court competitions held at Jamia Millia every year. He recalls: \"The university has an annual festival called MiRAAS, where several debate, ex tempore and essay writing competitions are held every year. The law students bring home the maximum awards.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story On a 2.2 km long road, fondly referred to as Scholar's Avenue, images of many of the country's biggest names stand shoulder to shoulder. Jawaharlal Nehru, Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose, Maulana Azad, Sardar Patel, Naidu and Rani Laxmi Bai are all there, each representing a hostel. So when Google's chief executive officer Sundar Pichai visits his alma mater and shouts \"Nehru ka tempo high hai\", he is greeted with a roar of applause as the students of his hostel make their approval known. Welcome to one of the country's premier engineering colleges-the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT-KGP). Spread over 2,100 acres of land, with lush greenery, lakes, broad lawns and huge trees in every direction, the university also boasts stadiums, tennis courts, hockey, football and cricket grounds, as well as a gym and a swimming pool. The architecture follows a simple principle-lots of air and light-and offers students a great deal of space. Without any formal boundary, IIT-KGP has succeeded in walling off the distracting influences of the outside world. Be it Kanhaiya Kumar or the beef ban, nothing ruffles or unsettles them. Politics, or 'poltu' in IIT-KGP lingo, is the last thing on their minds-except, of course, around February each year, when students elect their vice president, the highest post available to them. In general, though, students are more concerned with 'machao'/ 'makhao' (doing well/ flunking an exam) than they are with poltu. Students say that life at IIT-KGP is a great deal of fun. Here's a snapshot. It's just past midnight. \"Enough of muggo-maro (mugging)!\" someone declares. \"It's time for some bhaat maro (random conversations)!\" Though the library's lights are switched off at the stroke of 12, the night is still young on Scholar's Avenue. Students are spilling out of their hostels and research labs. They have taken up the road and the sidewalks; and someone is singing Give Me Some Sunshine from the evergreen 3 Idiots, backed up by the melodic strumming of a guitar. \"Our institute is not just about academics,\" says Burudi Aditya, a second-year student of computer science. \"It is not just about students developing in their areas of specialisation. There are a plethora of other options as well-foreign languages, visual communication, entrepreneurship, finance and film-making, for example-which can be taken up as parallel micro-credit or micro-specialisation courses.\" There are 30 micro-specialisation courses at IIT Kharagpur. among them photonics, intellectual property rights, quality engineering, management, law, social science, ocean engineering, geo-scientific exploration and foreign languages. These courses are meant to be taken up as 'breadth' subjects to add value to student's degrees. Taking courses like these also adds to the employability factor of the 'core' or 'depth' subjects. This means that at the end of a BTech course, a graduate from IIT-KGP is more than just a techie. Aside from the technological skills they gain, graduates could also be language scholars or cinematographers, or even have a degree in geo-science. As the institute's director, Partha P. Chakrabarti, says, \"IIT-KGP is not just a 'techno organisation'. It is an institute which allows for the convergence of multiple disciplines-a melting pot of technology and creativity. In the same class, we have engineers, lawyers and medicos, and this convergence is the hallmark of our new agenda. We transform the lives of our budding engineers, who in turn contribute to the transformation of IIT Kharagpur. \" \"IIT-KGP is not just our college,\" agrees Kasturi Saha, a fifth-year student of metallurgy. \"It is our world. To be honest, I don't even feel like going home for vacations.\" \"There is no life beyond IIT-KGP,\" continues the director. \"There are no shopping malls nearby, no decent cinema halls. But in the backyard of the railway colony of Kharagpur, IIT-KGP has everything.\" Sreelatha Challa, a second-year biotechnology student, who travelled to Kharagpur from Hyderabad, recalls her beginning at IIT-KGP. She says that teachers and teaching assistants take extra care with freshmen, ensuring constant guidance till they become confident enough of managing on their own. \"First-year students are accommodated in hostels exclusively meant for freshers,\" says Saha. \"The idea is to insulate them for a while. Ragging is a strict no-no. In fact, we have a different word for what we do: orientation.\" From the second year on, students are not only assigned to specific halls/ houses (Nehru, Homi J. Bhabha and the like), but also enter the more focused phase of their education. The different halls inculcate a spirit of friendly and healthy competition, and students also get a platform to showcase their other talents and hobbies and get a chance to take part in co-curricular activities. There is also a robotics society, as well as societies for dance, dramatics and photography. And even 50 years later, when alumni return for a visit, they find themselves cheering for their halls. It's things like this that prove that IIT-KGP is much more than a university-it is also a home away from home."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story For medical aspirants, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi is the 'Medical Mecca' of India. But be warned, it's no easy ride here. After cracking one of the toughest medical examinations in India, only a handful, 75 students, is selected for the MBBS course here every year. And the struggle does not end here. In fact, the grilling process starts once you enter the campus and make the first step in the medical career to become a doctor. \"AIIMS got established as an Act of Parliament in 1956,\" says Dr Randeep Guleria, the current AIIMS director. \"We found three areas we had to excel in. First was academics, so we developed innovative teaching and academic programmes that attract students from all over the country. Internationally, AIIMS today has one of the best academic programmes on offer. Our second priority was areas of research, and the third, optimum healthcare services for patients.\" Dr Guleria adds that over the past 60 years the institute has gained credibility and value in all three fields, setting a benchmark for the rest of the country. And this despite the departments and doctors being under pressure and working round-the-clock to handle the rush of patients. AIIMS gets over 10,000 patients every day. The number of surgeries performed is also growing every year. Director Guleria says \"the situation is such that we are now facing problems due to the huge rush of patients. We are looking at expansion and newer centres are coming up. We are in the process of developing a comprehensive master plan for further expansion to handle the increasing patient load and our own research demands\". Most patients who come here are under referral. That means a case that could be not handled further in the private or government hospital where the patient was being treated comes here. Treatment, of course, is subsidised and hence much cheaper. To put it in perspective, a heart transplant atAIIMS costs about Rs 1 lakh, while anywhere outside it is about Rs 20 lakh. Why AIIMS is different \"At first glance, one might think it's the beautiful campus, the optimum facilities for students and faculty etc. that attracts students, but all that is secondary,\" says Samaan Jukaka, a third-year MBBS student at AIIMS. \"What makes us proud'AIIMSonians' is that every day we are treating critical cases, the 'classic medical symptoms' which we learn in our medical text books. Here, you are not going to see a patient with a simple cough or fever. Even in your first posting, you will be handling a critical TB or cancer case. In my surgery posting, every third patient was carcinogenic.\" Aayush Lakkanna, another third year MBBS student, says \"the day starts at 8 am with us rushing for lectures. After that we are posted in different departments for patient care till lunch. After lunch, there's the afternoon lectures and practicals. We barely have time to grab a banana or a few biscuits before it's time for extra classes by the senior residents which involves the next day's postings\". AIIMS also has a different system in assessing students. As Lakkana puts it, \"We don't have weekly, monthly tests like other medical colleges. What this means is that we get more time to study. In the first and second year, we do have mid-semester and end-semester exams. After that we have a professional exam only at the end of fourth year. This way we are able to learn and concentrate more on patient care. A big plus is that the faculty is extremely friendly... we are a family here. There is no pressure from the faculty at all.\" Classroom environment Over the years, the institute has developed newer, more innovative teaching courses. Specialty courses have also started in important areas like intervention in cardiology, basic sciences, neuro-radiology etc. Since the focus is always on an interactive teaching environment, the institute offers integrated teaching skills where multiple specialties come together and teach rather than single expert teaching. This is to provide a comprehensive disease profile to the class. AIIMS is also trying to do more of virtual teaching modules, using graphics and technology to help students understand the human body and the diseases they will encounter better. As part of teaching programmes, medical professors here are also doing telemedicine consultations. A lot of the lectures are also being shared with other medical colleges. Students are also required to be quick on the uptake as the working environment changes drastically from department-to-department. Being in the top medical college of the country also has its advantages. As Lakkana says, in other medical colleges, nearly 20 students work on a single cadaver; here at AIIMS, the ratio is 8-9 students to a cadaver. AIIMS has also consistently been No. 1 in the country as far as medical research is concerned. Even internationally, AIIMS ranks No. 3, with only America's Harvard Medical School and Mayo Clinic rated above it. The institute is also doing research and collaborations in new areas, including stem cells and nano technology. Dr Pramod Garg, professor in the department of gastroenterology, and Sub-Dean, Research, at AIIMS, says, \"With the passage of time, the number of research projects which numbered less than 100 when we started has increased tremendously. Today, the institute has approximately 600 ongoing projects and 150 individual research fellows.\" And it's not just all work and no play for the budding doctors. The AIIMS campus has a gym, table tennis courts, a football ground, basketball and volleyball courts. The swimming pool is a popular hangout during the summer months, while there are a few who are dedicated to their post-shift basketball and football games every night. There's also the seven-day-long gala university festival, 'Pulse', which happens every year in September. It's a must attend event for medical students from all over India. Even students from a few neighbouring nations make it a point to come. \"It started in 1978 and today it's the No. 1 medical fest in Southeast Asia. Every night is special. We have star nights, a band night, comedy night, sufi night, fashion shows... preparations have already started,\" says an AIIMS student. With the best infrastructure and facilities, and a campus engulfed in green with its Gulmohar, Ashoka and palm trees, AIIMS is an oasis for critical patients. The medical institute has 53 clinical departments including 9 super-specialty centres. With its many regional centres, the main AIIMS is a WHO collaboration centre."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Research and innovation are thriving at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi), the top ranked technical university in the India Today-MDRA Best Universities survey. The most recent example of the institute’s inventiveness is the Coronavirus diagnostic kit developed by its researchers, the Corosure kit, approved by the ICMR, reduces both the cost and time required for testing. The institute has always been at the forefront of technological innovation, more so during the pandemic. In May, an IIT Delhi start-up, Nanosafe Solutions, launched an anti-microbial, washable face mask called NSafe. A first-of-its-kind invention, this mask can be washed up to 50 times and has a bacteria-filtration efficiency of about 99.2 per cent. These examples clearly indicate why IIT Delhi leads the game when it comes to technical education. With multiple departments for postgraduate study, including applied mechanics, biochemical engineering and biotechnology, chemical engineering, computer science and engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering and textile and fibre engineering, among others, the institute offers students the best research, development and training facilities in the field of science, engineering and technology. MTech degree programmes include subjects like applied mechanics, atmospheric science, chemical engineering, chemistry, civil engineering, engineering mechanics and design engineering, to name a few. IIT Delhi is also home to three kinds of Centres of Excellence (CoEs), those funded by the institute, funded by industry, and those funded as sponsored projects. The ones set up by the institute are researching areas such as biologically inspired robots and cyber systems and information assurance, while industry-sponsored CoEs are working on oil technology, waste management and sustainable infrastructure. CoEs funded as sponsored projects include a DRDO-IIT Delhi advanced technology centre, among others. Interview V. Ramgopal Rao, Director, IIT-Delhi “Students should get to demonstrate their skills at research” A fellow of the Indian National Academy of Engineering and the Indian National Science Academy, V. Ramgopal Rao, as director of IIT Delhi, is at the helm of several changes that have been made at the institute in the past few years. A P.K. Kelkar Chair professor for nanotechnology at IIT Bombay before joining IIT Delhi as its director, Rao has also been responsible for aligning the curriculum at the premier institute to the needs of the time. Here, he talks about why IIT Delhi is renowned for its postgraduate education. What changes have been made in the past three years to improve the quality of education in IIT Delhi’s postgraduate programmes? A. We have deeply integrated our postgraduate programmes with high-quality research, and have invested in building a research facility. In the past three years, we also have started a few new programmes that are funded by the industry. [A principle] of postgraduate education at IIT Delhi is that students should get to demonstrate their research skills, that’s why industry sponsorship has been brought in. It helps students understand what the industry requirements are, and to get hands-on training. There are two types of students who come to IIT Delhi for postgraduate studies, those who want to find a job after earning their Masters’ degree, and those who want to pursue a PhD after their MTech. For those keen to get a job after their Masters’, industry collaborations help a lot. At the same time, both categories of students also get exposed to real world problems. In the past three years, we have also started two new departments, the department of material science and the department of design, to offer our students something new. At the same time, a centre for automotive research and a centre for cyber-physical systems have also been set up, as well as two new schools, the school of interdisciplinary research and the school of public policy. This year, we also plan to start a school of artificial intelligence. Q. Are there any new initiatives being planned at IIT Delhi for the near future? A. The Indian model of postgraduate education is very different from the model followed in the US. In American universities, students don’t need a Masters’ degree to do a PhD; they can apply to PhD programmes after completing their BTech. In India, students who go for a Masters’ degree are generally looking for a job after that; their education needs to be aligned with industry needs. Keeping that in mind, at IIT Delhi, we are trying to review all our Masters’ programmes so that they are industry-aligned. We have already started this process. [Moving forward], an MTech in cybersecurity and an MTech in artificial intelligence will also be offered; we need people trained in these fields. So, overall, a major change and alignment will be taking place in our Masters’ programmes and courses. Further, our MTech students don’t pay a fee and are given a monthly stipend of Rs 12,000. We are now proposing that MTech programmes become cost-neutral, which means that our students will be sponsored by the industry as well. Q. What are some of the best-performing postgraduate courses at IIT Delhi? A. Computer science, data science and a few programmes offered by the electrical department are quite popular."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The National Law School of India University (NLSIU) in Bengaluru, which emerged as the country’s best law university in the latest India Today-MDRA Best Universities survey, has not only carved an identity of its own but maintained its eminence since it was established over 30 years ago. NLSIU has become the template for legal education across the country. The hallmarks of the institution are its emphasis on quality education, a vibrant environment, an opportunity for students to interact with legal luminaries and a free-thinking culture. While NLSIU pioneered the five-year integrated BA LLB (Hons) course, it has given equal importance to postgraduate programmes, such as the Master’s Programme in Public Policy (MPP) and Master of Laws (LLM). Prof (Dr) Sudhir Krishnaswamy, who took over as vice-chancellor of NLSIU in 2019, has embarked on a mission to revamp the PG programmes so that they reflect the latest trends in law education. The emphasis of the courses, he says, is on involving students in the university’s research projects, some of which have shaped government policies and frameworks in the past. While the Covid-19 pandemic has prompted big changes in the way education will be imparted, Dr Krishnaswamy believes the system should move towards adopting online learning platforms that will help students complete their courses. At the same time, NLSIU gives adequate emphasis on the mental and social health of students by integrating various support systems that will help the young minds overcome stress and obstacles in the pursuit of their academic goals. Prof. (Dr) Sudhir Krishnaswamy Vice-Chancellor, National Law School of India University, Bengaluru NLSIU pioneered legal education in the country, but far from resting on its laurels, the university continues to revamp its programmes to provide students an edge in the professional world. In an interview with Aravind Gowda, NLSIU Vice-Chancellor Dr Sudhir Krishnaswamy talks about the new endeavours in the campus. Excerpts: What makes PG education at NLSIU special? A. NLSIU lays emphasis on its flagship master’s programmes, Master’s Programme in Public Policy (MPP) and Master of Laws (LLM). While MPP is relatively new, launched seven years ago, the LLM programme is being offered for the past 30 years. We have streamlined both programmes by taking feedback from the past five years. PG education at NLSIU is distinct because unlike most universities, where PG courses are a step down from undergraduate programmes, we have not reduced the intensity. We continue to run PG on a trimester model, with an extremely learning-oriented approach, which gives more days at the university than any other comparable programme in the country. We bring in more inter-discipline narrative, one year’s experience to LLM and two years to MPP. In the past few years, we have scaled back on MPhil and focused our energies on PhD. It doesn’t mean we have increased the numbers, but are in the process of providing solutions to everybody who takes up the programme. We want it to be an on-campus programme for at least three years and integrate our PhD programmes into our research projects as well as give students an opportunity to participate in the intellectual life of the university. Q. What all has been done in the past three years to improve the quality of education and academic environment? A. PG students benefit immensely from four of our important initiatives: * Weekly seminars by students on original research work. * Weekly lecture: we invite a person who has published a book or an impactful article to engage with the students. * Strengthen integration of PG students in research activities by allowing them to work as research associates/ fellows. * We have modest research funding so that students can travel and present their papers at conferences; we help them secure grants for field work. Q. What new things are being planned at the PG level? A. The most significant push is towards the launch of a three-year PG LLB, which has already been approved by our Academic Council. This is in addition to the existing five-year BA LLB (Hons) programme. Though three-year LLB programmes exist, ours is an innovative course. We are also streamlining the PG courses to ensure that LLM, MPP and PhD students can increasingly work together, it can be in cross-listed seminars or as collaboration in clinical projects or social intervention projects. Q. What unique facilities does NLSIU offer its students? A. The biggest differentiator for NLSIU is that it is a fully residential campus. Of course, Covid-19 has compelled changes in order to be able to sustain this claim, as our students are now studying online. At NLSIU, students learn from each other much more than they learn in classrooms. We stand way and above any other university in promoting peer culture for academic learning. We are investing heavily on extending support to students to get along, provide social support and mental health support. We did have a basic student counselling service, which is now completely revamped. We start from an inverted triangle approach. At the base level, we have student peer support. The next layer is the faculty mentor support, not necessarily their teachers and primarily for non-academic support. The third is the tech-enhanced layer through app-based services, offering self-help, self-guidance, relaxation and meditation techniques. This has been a huge hit, the uptake among students is more than 50 per cent. Over and above all these is the availability of counsellors, both face to face and online. The final layer is filled by a psychiatrist. All these initiatives are extremely critical, considering the mental health situation in the country. NLSIU is also offering students intensive English language support because the inability to read or write in English could translate into mental and social health difficulties. Students face learning difficulties, do not know how to express their anxieties, feel inadequately supported, these can become wider issues in social life. Our student programme is designed to tackle all these systematically. Q. Which are your best-performing/ new-age PG courses? A. It’s the MPP programme, simply because it is dynamic and newer. It attracts a diverse range of graduates. Q. How has NLSIU been preparing to handle the Covid-19 pandemic? A. We have migrated our programmes to an online model. To prepare for the long term, we are enhancing the learning management platform, working towards achieving completion of the learning modules by the students rather than just putting up learning material or conducting online sessions. We are also preparing the campus for a hybrid learning model, and will probably open the institution in a staggered manner whenever we have the permission to run classes. Our classrooms are Covid-ready while hostels are in the process of being made Covid-ready. This is an expensive affair, as 2-3 seat rooms have to be converted into single-seater rooms. We run the risk of losing rooms, from a capacity of 600 to 450. We are still not ready to have all our students at the campus as much will depend on the Covid-19 situation. The long-term prospect is to prepare for an upgraded and much more medically sanitised facility than we have provided before. The investments are on and we will be ready by the end of the academic year."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In the US, many top universities, including Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Princeton and MIT are private not-for-profit universities. Most of them are hundreds of years old. In India, the revolution of private not-for-profit universities started only about 25 years ago, when institutions like Amity were established. I have no doubt that in the future, when people name the leading universities in India, many private names will be on the list. Given their young age in India, it is commendable that of the less than 50 Indian universities that are ranked well globally, a third are private institutions. India has a great advantage moving forward, the number and percentage of our young people. What is necessary to unlock this great potential is the education of our youth, we must impart the skills and knowledge that help them become gainfully employed and lead our country to prosperity. Considering the Gross Enrolment Ratio targets and the numbers of students entering the school system through the Right to Education Act, the government had, many years ago, calculated that another 1,500 universities were needed in India. The realisation that it would be difficult for it to establish so many on its own led to the growth of private universities. I call the phenomena of private universities in India a revolution because, over the years, everyone, from the government to benefactors of universities, experienced a steep and tough learning curve. They had to learn how to empower private foundations to create and run quality private universities, without stifling them with regulation. One excellent policy is ‘graded autonomy’, universities that perform well on established parameters get increasing autonomy from regulations. I believe that the government should set very high entry barriers for permission to establish private universities. That will allow reputable universities to create, with supervision that is enabling. In large numbers, there are always those who compromise on quality, especially when there is a major demand-supply disparity. This has always been the bane of serious educationists. But times have changed. Students and parents realise that the parchment of a degree has less value than the transformation of a student through a university. Transformation of students is the underlying value on which basis private universities around the world have led, and will do so in India. In traditional universities, the degree programme is the ‘product’. It is up to the student to absorb it or benefit from it. At universities like Amity, each student is our ‘product’. Each student is given individual attention to ensure that they develop to their maximum potential. The agility and speed in decision-making of private universities is another strong foundation of their success. In an era when technology is advancing rapidly, where current job profiles will be redundant in the future and new skills will be needed, universities that cannot adapt and innovate will not survive. One example is the curriculum, in traditional universities, it is reviewed once every five years. In good private universities, it is in continuous evolution in close cooperation with the industry. The global pandemic has further highlighted the importance of adaptability and speed. At Amity, our faculty and tech staff across the world worked day and night to ensure that over 150,000 students smoothly transferred to remote online teaching within days of lockdowns being announced. Online youth fests were organised to keep students engaged, where over 25,000 students from hundreds of schools and universities participated. Over 1,900 online guest lectures were organised with Nobel laureates, industry leaders, eminent scientists and spiritual leaders such as the Dalai Lama and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. The resilience of good universities has shone through in these tough times, an indicator of why there are more universities than companies over a hundred years of age in the world. When benchmarking against the best in the world, Indian universities have a long way to go. But the future bodes well. As more corporate houses and philanthropists like Dr Ashok K. Chauhan, the founder of Amity, take up the challenge of helping our country prosper through transformational education, the day is not far when the world will come back to India to study, like in the days of Takshila and Nalanda. Private not-for-profit universities that are founded on the true principles of public service will surely lead the way. Dr Atul Chauhan is Chancellor, Amity University, and President, Amity Education Group"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story India, considered a land of learning between the 1st and 8th centuries A.D., has the third-largest higher education system in the world. India has been home to universities of repute, like Nalanda, Takshashila, Vallabhi, Vikramshila and Kanchipuram, yet Indian Institutions of higher education have not made a mark on the international league tables of excellence. With three decades in the field of higher education and as the steward of a university aspiring to be world-class, I will enumerate a few of my observations here. Contemporary narratives in Indian higher education have always pointed to the rise of private institutes as a reason behind the diminishing relevance of state and regional-level institutes, and for creating an imbalance between excellence and inclusion. There are centres of excellence, like the IITs, IIMs, IISc and central universities, but the student intake in these are considerably lower than state and regional-level universities, but a lack of infrastructure and of qualified and good teachers are problems that come with the massification of higher education. It is this gap that private Universities like CHRIST (Deemed to be University) have filled. Christ functions as a state university in terms of student enrolment, has a global curriculum, research culture and pedagogy like that of centres of excellence and steers India towards becoming a knowledge society while keeping in mind ethical, inclusive and sustainable aspects as envisioned by UNESCO in the 21st century. To bring Indian institutes at par with global institutes, one must focus on identifying outstanding students and provide them with challenging tasks and internship opportunities, and on creating a bridge for those students who might not have made a smooth transition to the expected level of the class by offering remedial courses. This will ensure that the potential of each student is developed. Institutions need autonomy to design and implement the learning outcome they have envisioned for students. The state and central governments need to maintain a balance between regulation and intervention. Political interventions in the administration of universities and one-upmanship in defaming the institution through media bullying will only bring the stakeholders’ morale down. Universities have to give equal priority to teaching, research and human resource training, whether it is in upskilling or competency development. Universities today have a responsibility to produce not just employable individuals but citizen scholars. While faculty development and quality improvement programmes should be included in the academic calendar of the institution, it is also important to ensure that induction and orientation programmes are periodically conducted to inform and assimilate the stakeholders into the organisational culture and philosophy. Without such steps, one may not attain a balancing of faculty members’ time between teaching, research and building organisational culture. It is imperative for universities to focus on research to be recognised as world class universities. For this, universities should be linked to research institutes and expert departments, nationally and internationally, so that faculty and students can benefit from access to specialised laboratories and eminent researchers. Students should have a choice of interdisciplinary courses to choose from. Credit and semester system practice, choice-based courses for lifelong learning and national and international massive open online courses go a long way in helping students choose relevant courses. It is also important for universities to plan to move up to international and national standards and provide quality education to our students. The National Institute Ranking Framework and grades for universities by NAAC increase the quality of education provided. It becomes the responsibility of the university to work towards getting such accreditations. Today’s universities have a great responsibility of producing not just employable individuals but citizen scholars and intellectual entrepreneurs. Therefore there should be concerted efforts by education leaders to envision the university as a catalyst for social transformation. There is a need to turn to humanities and social sciences to be more sensitive to cultural, gender and environmental issues. In the 21st century networking and the internet lends itself to exchange and interaction and sharing become a democratic endeavour. So universities today are poised to become knowledge societies that will thrive not through competition or emulation, but on a spirit of collaboration for the common good. Our universities should become universitas magistrorum et scholarium —a community of teachers and scholars of various disciplines. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} Article by Dr. Fr. Abraham V.M, Vice-Chancellor of Christ (Deemed to be University), Bengaluru"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown has disrupted our lives and severely affected the higher education system. Continuing with routine academic and research activities, while ensuring the educational fraternity remains safe and healthy, has been the biggest challenge. To ensure uninterrupted teaching and learning at home and to minimise academic losses, the UGC advised all the universities to shift to online mode of teaching and learning. There has been an institutional effort to combat Covid-19 through knowledge, technology and innovation. Institutions have tried to leverage the potential of technology, but there are challenges, and we are yet to fully integrate online teaching and learning in mainstream higher education. There are also limitations with regard to access for socioeconomically disadvantaged students, internet supply and technical knowhow of the instructional design, particularly in the rural/ tribal areas. We are fortunate that the present generation of learners are quick to adapt to technology once they have access to it. This is a manifestation of the story of India’s digital growth. The higher education system has tried to adapt to the crisis. Technology, considered yesterday’s disruptor, has become today’s savior. Right now, various video conferencing apps are providing our higher education institutions a lifeline. But we need to have a robust and multi-faceted response plan involving collective efforts at the faculty, student and institutional level along with the government and regulatory bodies like the UGC. While the government and regulatory bodies have a role to play at the policy level, the institutions, the students and the faculty must be at the forefront in implementation. The closure of educational institutions has three different aspects to it—health and safety, teaching-learning process and psychological issues. The top priority is to keep our students safe and healthy. Information sharing and health awareness is vital to keep students and academic staff safe from infection. While keeping them safe, there is also an urgent need to continue their learning through different ways. Home learning will help our student community come out of this difficult phase well. The most difficult part has been students grappling with psychological problems due to anxiety and stress with regard to academic losses, exams and the overall academic calendar. It is very important to maintain relationships and a sense of belonging for the cognitive emotional rehabilitation of affected students or academic staff. Very early into the lockdown, the UGC proactively constituted a ‘Task Force for Redressal of Grievances Related to the Covid-19 Pandemic’ and a dedicated helpline to handle grievances of the academic community. To reassure the students and to negate any stress or panic vis- -vis their studies and health, the UGC issued a number of advisories to higher education institutions on mental and psychosocial aspects and wellbeing of students. The ministry of human resource development (HRD) also launched the Manodarpan initiative to provide psychosocial support to students, teachers and families through a website, a toll-free helpline, national directory of counsellors and an interactive chat platform. A calm, assured and swift response at the individual level of the students, faculty and staff will be key to finding a way through this situation. At the second tier of our collective efforts, our institutions have a key role to play. The primary responsibility of the institution is to take intensive measures to protect all students and staff members from the disease. Reassuring the students and parents is the next vital element of institutional response. Institutional preparedness in terms of connecting teachers and students through online tools and platforms will help in mitigating the issue of engagement with the students. These engagements need to be valid, prompt and specific to the needs of our students. Traditional faceto-face education is of great significance and frequent exchange of dialogue between the teacher and the pupil is vital but in prevailing circumstances, we have to rely on online and a blended mode of learning. Institutions are striving for distance learning solutions from integrated digital learning platforms, video lessons, e-PG Pathshala, MOOCs through the SWAYAM portal and Swayamprabha DTH channels. While using technology for instructional design, our institutions need to focus on relevance, effective delivery, adequate support and risk management strategies for unexpected developments. Another aspect is developing the capacity of teachers to teach remotely. The preparedness and skills of teachers to teach and students to learn using technology and the role of family and parents to mitigate the complex environment at home is also important. The faculty members are in the process of transitioning to online teaching platforms. The MHRD through the Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya National Mission on Teachers and Teaching (PMMMNMTT) and UGC through its human resource development centres (HRDCs) are organising short-term programmes to prepare the teachers for online education. There is still a need to strengthen online content, augment digital infrastructure and hi-tech, lowtech and no-tech approaches to ensure the communication channels between students and the faculty remain open. The government and regulatory bodies like the UGC are at the next stage of our combined response. Keeping all stakeholders informed about the policy and practice is the primary task at this level. The UGC has been constantly engaging with the institutions, faculty and student community to find flexible ways for continuation of a student’s learning trajectories. The UGC released the ‘Guidelines on Examinations and Academic Calendar’ for the universities in April 2020 and subsequently a revised version was issued in July 2020 to ensure the health, safety and security of students, faculty and staff; conducting the examinations and declaration of results; facilitating students in the participation of further admissions, placement and research and charting out a plan for the next academic session. The UGC has also been trying to facilitate online and blended learning to ascertain a flexible, resilient and responsive education system. The UGC is going to put in monitoring mechanisms to ensure that the online programmes of Indian universities are of global standards. Shortly, a new Integrated Open and Distance Learning (ODL) and Online Programmes Regulations will be notified that will enable the 100 top universities to start Automatically Online Programmes as per the PM-eVidya programme under the Atmanirbhar Bharat announcement. Other better performing universities can also avail this with the prior approval of the UGC. Degree level full-fledged online educational programmes will not only help expand our access and increase in GER (Gross Enrolment Ratio) but also help in unforeseen situation like the Covid-19 pandemic. Further, the UGC recently approved increasing the capping of online education through MOOCs on SWAYAM platform, in conventional universities from 20 to 40 per cent. With regard to examinations, considering that the learning assessment is the globally accepted feedback mechanism of education, the UGC issued detailed Guidelines on Examinations and Academic Calendar in April 2020 and a revised version in July. It provided for completion of the terminal semester/ final year examinations by the end of September 2020 following the SoPs issued by the HRD ministry and duly vetted by the ministry of health and family welfare related to health and safety. The institutions were provided with the option of offline (pen and paper)/ online/ blended (online plus offline) mode of examinations. There have been concerns with regard to conduct of the examination, however, there was a need to plan keeping in view the larger interests and future prospects of students nationally and globally. Further, the UGC is ensuring that the students do not face any inconvenience. The students of terminal semester/ final year who are unable to appear for exams will be given an opportunity to appear in special exams for such courses or papers. .at_iframe{width:100%;border:none;}@media(min-width:767px){.at_iframe{height:744px;}} Finally, efforts are being made at all levels to keep the wheel of education rolling during these unprecedented times. We may also have to scale up our efforts. There is a need to settle into the new reality for the foreseeable future. Different approaches will be needed in different situational contexts. Different stakeholders at various levels of the education system will have different roles to play. This will be a vast exercise but effective and constant engagement with the students with the abiding principle of ‘leave no one behind’ will be key."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The India Today Group's annual Best Universities survey has emerged as the most authoritative commentary on higher education in the country. The exercise, conducted by the Nielsen Company, mirrors the emerging trends in university education. As innovation has been the norm, the survey for 2017 ranks the universities across four streams, general (arts, science and commerce), technical, medical and legal. With each passing year, private universities have been challenging the traditional centres of learning. While such competition is welcome, what's of concern is the performance of Indian universities on the global platform. On June 9, when President Pranab Mukherjee received the 2018 edition of the QS World University Rankings compiled by the Education Promotion Society of India, he had reason to be pleased. Three institutions, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, had found place in the list. The president, however, sounded a word of caution that while there has been considerable infrastructure expansion in higher education, the quality of education remains worrying, and many Indians are pursuing their higher education abroad. Numbers justify his concern: as per official US data, some 166,000 Indians study in that country. The Union government is taking steps to stop this brain drain. The HRD ministry has proposed to create 20 educational institutions, to be christened Institutions of Eminence. Ten government and 10 private institutions will be conferred the status, with a Rs 10,000 crore funding for the former. The government institutions will apply to the ministry. A private university will need a sponsoring organisation with a net worth of Rs 5,000 crore, a detailed 15-year vision plan and a five-year rolling implementation plan. The Institutions of Eminence will be selected by an empowered expert committee of three to five eminent persons appointed for three years, with the final approval of the appointments committee of the Cabinet headed by the prime minister. The institutions will have complete academic, administrative and financial autonomy and will be free from the restrictive inspection regime of the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the regulatory control over fee and curriculum. They will have to achieve a place in the top 500 of any of the global rankings within 10 years and eventually climb to the top 100. The idea appears to have originated from a report by the T.S.R. Subramanian-headed Committee for Evolution of the New Education Policy. It was set up by former HRD minister Smrit Irani. One of the report's recommendations reads: \"Over the next decade, at least 100 new centres for excellence in the field of higher education need to be established. If this is successfully accomplished, it will pave the way for India to host major research and innovation initiatives.\" Though the ministry has junked the report and Irani's successor, Prakash Javadekar, has announced he will set up a new committee to formulate the education policy, it's heartening to see the government take measures to improve higher education. More changes are afoot. Higher education watchdogs such as the UGC and the All India Council for Technical Education will be replaced by the Higher Education Empowerment Regulation Agency. A single regulator is being put in place to eliminate overlaps in jurisdiction and do away with regulatory provisions that may now be irrelevant. Several panels, such as the Yashpal committee, National Knowledge Commission, Hari Gautam committee and Subramanian committee, had suggested replacing the multiple regulatory authorities with a single entity. While the idea will take a while to fructify, it could well be the beginning of reforms the country's higher education sector is awaiting."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story India has nearly 1,000 universities, making our higher education system one of the largest in the world. With a current enrolment of 35.7 million students, India is second only to China’s 41.8 million. India’s Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER), which refers to the proportion of 16 to 23-year-olds enrolled in higher education, went up from 8.1 per cent in 2001-02 to 27.4 in 2017-18, as per the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE). However, it remains lower than the global average of 36.7 per cent. The Union ministry of human resource development aims to take this GER to 32 per cent by 2022. The increase in student enrolment has been primarily driven by privately-owned institutions. However, as a 2019 report—‘Reviving Higher Education in India’—by the Brookings Institution, a US-based thinktank, highlighted, despite hotbeds of excellence I Universities that have been in the news for political reasons don’t let it come in the way of their academic standing heading towards a “massification” of higher education, India lagged behind in the quality and distribution of higher education. Given this disparity, it becomes imperative for an aspiring student to find the right university, which will not only impart a meaningful education but will also enhance an individual’s employability. This is where the annual India Today Best University survey hopes to make a difference. Armed with a robust methodology, the survey ranks the country’s universities across four streams— general, medical, technical and law. As private universities begin to play a larger role in the spread of higher education, they are ranked separately under the general stream. What is most encouraging about this year’s rankings is that universities which have been in the news for the past year for political developments have not let it sully What makes PG education in JNU special JNU has been from its inception encouraging and promoting an interdisciplinary approach in PG programmes. Almost every PG programme of the university has inbuilt in it a structure which allows students to opt for courses from any other discipline available in the university. So, for example, a student from social sciences can opt for a course related to environmental issues which is taught in the School of Environmental Sciences. A language student can go to the School of Sanskrit, School of Social Sciences or School of International Studies for learning skills in an area of his/ her choice. In this way, it facilitates the realising of interests and potential as well as shapes the intellect and personality of the student. Many students have acquired expertise and knowledge to go and work in diverse areas of art, culture, politics, energy sector, community health and natural sciences, as the case may be. Every school of the university, both in the sciences and humanities disciplines, design their courses to impart a well-rounded training to graduates. Courses are reviewed and upgraded on a regular basis considering current and future advances in the particular field. Along with interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary options, a major emphasis is also laboratory and fieldwork. The University over the past three years has taken decisions to open up three major schools and three special centres to enhance PG education. These are the School of Engineering, Atal Bihari Vajpayee School of Management and Entrepreneurship, School of Indian Traditional Dance and Music, Special Centre for National Security, Special Centre for Study of North-East India and Special Centre for Disaster Research. We have upgraded the Special Centre for Sanskrit Studies to a full-fledged School of Sanskrit and Indic Studies. We also restarted the convocation process in 2018. Faculty recruitment was a long pending exercise, which was affecting teaching in some key areas. We ensured that vacant positions were filled in a given timeframe so as to ensure that the gap areas are strengthened. Student intake for research degree programmes has also been increased. The university will bring in expertise in the new disciplines initiated in the past three years. Also, innovations in teaching tools, particularly by using India’s digital technology resources, will intensify student training and equip them with highly skilled knowledge. JNU is also planning online degree, diploma and certificate courses utilising the expertise of faculty members. The campus is a green belt spread over 1,000 acres with wildlife all around. Just walking around in the campus gives you that spiritual feeling of being one with nature. The layout ensures accessibility between the hostels and the academic block. This is probably the only campus which connects day scholars with public transport bus facility. The university is a world in itself with access to anything and at anytime on the campus. The favorite place for students after class hours is the library, which is open throughout the night. In addition to this, one can find students running between hostels after late-night group studies. These activities are encouraged with an active security system and a culture of respecting each other. With internet connectivity across campus, you can sometimes see students completing assignments in the moonlight. Science and language schools have state-of-the-art laboratories with free and open access to students. JNU being a research cum teaching university with a world-class faculty has re-framed its IP policy and has also geared itself to contribute to the start-up revolution through the Atal Incubation Centre-Jawaharlal Nehru University Foundation for Innovation (AIC-JNUFI). The AIC-JNUFI has been established as a Section 8 ‘not for profit’ company under the Companies Act 2013 to promote start-ups in various sectors like health, IT, energy/ environment, food/ agriculture, rural technologies, and other areas, without limiting the scope of activities. Now, any student or faculty member of the university can have their own start-up company based on their ideas and expertise in the campus. A recent example of the uniqueness of JNU’s PG courses is the School of Engineering where the students do a five-year integrated program. They study core engineering during the first four years and in the fifth year, they register for a masters degree (MS) in one of the areas of social sciences and humanities or languages. Another example is masters in Ayurveda Biology where experts from life sciences, immunology, molecular medicine and biotechnology have teamed up with the teachers from the School of Sanskrit (using Sanskrit texts on Ayurveda medicine and principles) to teach and train the students. Winston Churchill is credited with the saying, “Never let a good crisis go to waste.” We were the first to isolate the campus to break any kind of transmission. Our teachers and students quickly switched to online platforms. Perhaps we are the only university in the country whose academic calendar was least affected. Most of the schools successfully completed the semester requirements. We are also preparing to conduct online interviews of students for admission in the next academic session. JNU established a ‘Covid-19 Task Force’ as soon as the pandemic hit India which has experts from various disciplines of the university. These academics meet regularly, study the pandemic and its daily impact on India, especially in JNU, and provide advice to keep the campus safe from the deadly virus. The task force keeps a close watch on every aspect of Covid and provides ways to combat it in JNU. Another committee headed by the dean of students has officers taking care of the students staying on campus and looking into all the aspects of Covid-19 related management to help the students. What’s unique about the Amity campus What makes AUUP (Amity University Uttar Pradesh) unique is initiatives such as the study abroad program at Amity’s campuses around the world. We have several US and UK accreditations. Support services including career development, incubator and many more are provided by the university. A unique mentor-mentee system is available for students to seek support. Unique modules have been created for students on behavioural sciences and business communication skills to enhance leadership and communication skills. We follow a 4-tier mentoring approach with a 24x7 students counselling and guidance cell. Plans to handle the Covid-19 pandemic AUUP is the first university to go for remote teaching using digital platforms. Research capabilities of PG students were enhanced through independent student research and live online industry projects/internships during the lockdown period. Online examinations of final year students have already been conducted. The new academic session (2020-21) for senior students commenced on July 13. All classes are being conducted remotely on online platforms. The students will have access to all learning resources, labs and faculty members online for teaching, learning, assessment and support cation if there is no increase in the funding for students to access higher education. A comparison with neighbouring China can illustrate India’s challenge better. Between 1996 and 2001, India and China had similar GERs. However, in the next five years, China doubled its enrolment rate from 9.76 per cent to 20 per cent, while India increased its GER by merely 2 per cent. And the reason for the dramatic rise in China’s GER was its increased funding in the past two decades to students pursuing higher education. AIIMS has been setting the agenda for methodologies and innovations in medical education. We are constantly incorporating the latest advancements in global research and clinical care in our curriculum which makes for holistic and upto-date teaching. AIIMS New Delhi is visited by more than 3 million patients every year for OPD consultations. We perform more than 200,000 surgeries and also admit more than 200,000 patients every year. This practical exposure is unique to AIIMS. Students not only learn how to practise but are a part of our public healthcare system from the onset. AIIMS takes great pride in providing worldclass health care at a minimal cost. Many interventional procedures like angioplasty and stenting for heart patients and complex cardiac, neurological and cancer surgeries are done free of cost. AIIMS has set up a biosafety level 2 and 3 laboratory facility. This is an integrated hub of contemporary technologies—genomics, proteomics, bioanalytics and bioinformatics. The National Cancer Institute has been made fully functional. We have also forged research collaborations with IITs and international universities which allow knowledge-sharing and boosts research practices. We are planning a School of Public Health; an advanced surgical block for the development of advanced robotics; and a national ageing and geriatric medicine centre. These will be more focused sub-centres within the campus which will be of interest and professional value to students interested in the field. The entire campus is also being upgraded at a cost of Rs 7,000 crore, and it will be revamped with world-class infrastructure and academic facilities. AIIMS New Delhi has the highest number of published research papers in indexed journals in medical sciences in the country. More than 700 collaborative research projects are running with national and international funding of about US $16 million. AIIMS students also receive individual mentorship from some of India’s best doctors. The popular ones are bone marrow transplantation, nuclear medicine technology, perfusion technology, urology technology, fetal medicine, arthroplasty, minimal access surgery and telemedicine. AIIMS has set up a SARAL platform for blended learning and online delivery of educational content. Since March 2020, physical classes for undergraduate students have been suspended and online teaching using the SARAL platform and web-streaming is widely used. Till date, 2,189 users have registered and 198 courses have been created on the platform. Campuses are unlikely to return anytime soon. Institutions will need to plan meticulously to adhere to physical distancing norms. Simultaneously, they have to safeguard the teaching-learning process, governance, research, skill development and health of the stakeholders. Ever since campuses shut down in March, face-to-face teaching learning-evaluation and field-laboratory-based research activities have come to a halt, making way for technology-enabled academic activities. Despite India making significant progress in internet and mobile-phone penetration, the digital divide between urban and rural and rich and poor poses a huge challenge in making education uniformly available to students from all sections of society. In fact, as India heads towards making a global mark in the knowledge economy, universities will have to play a decisive role in building an inclusive society where innovation, technology and implementation don’t remain restricted to a few. A high density of researchers is directly correlated to the quality of education in a country and how it benefits industries and thus the economy. India has 216 researchers per one million inhabitants as against 1,200 in China, 4,300 in the US and 7,100 in South Korea, according to the report. Yet, most research in India actually takes place in standalone research institutions, outside the university system. Universities in India have also often been criticised for ignoring the local context in their research. Indian universities also place a higher premium on teaching rather than research as the high workload forces teachers to devote a significant portion of their time to the task. A high density of researchers is a mark of quality education; India has just 216 researchers per million people, china has 1,200, the US 4,300 To make them relevant and the nucleus of India’s knowledge economy, Indian universities have to strive for excellence in two ways—by significantly making solution-oriented contributions to society at large and generating knowledge through an enabling, transparent and participative structure. That requires radical changes in academic and administrative systems and processes within the universities. The ones that keep up with the ever-evolving global and national requirements will rule our rankings year after year. With nearly 950 universities and around 155 institutes of national importance for higher education to choose from, this annual edition of the India Today Group ranking of best universities in India aims to make a critical career decision easier for aspirants. The rich information and data of the survey has helped it emerge as the gold standard for stakeholders such as recruiters, parents, alumni, policymakers, the general public and universities too. The methodology by India Today knowledge partner MDRA has set several milestones. During objective ranking, MDRA carefully attuned 120-plus attributes to provide the most comprehensive and balanced comparisons of universities. These performance indicators were clubbed into five broad parameters—reputation and governance, academic and research excellence, infrastructure and living experience, personality and leadership development and career progression and placement. To give a more realistic and accurate picture, MDRA has evaluated universities based on current year data. The ranking tables also give the parameter-wise scores of universities to provide deeper insights on key aspects of decision-making. Briefly, the ranking was done by the following steps: a) Desk review and expert opinion: an extensive desk review of MDRA’s database and secondary research was conducted to shortlist universities under various categories such as General, Technical, Medical and Law, which were: l offering full time, in-classroom courses l had a minimum three pass-out batches till the end of 2019 l post-graduate programmes were ranked A list of 750-plus universities including institutes of national importance fulfilling the above criteria were prepared and contacted directly. b) Determination of weightages: Experts with rich experience in their fields were consulted to frame the parameters and sub-parameters pertinent to respective categories of universities. Indicators critical for establishing best universities were meticulously determined and their relative weights were finalised. c) Objective survey: Comprehensive objective questionnaires were designed for each category of the university taking into account the decided performance indicators. Universities fulfilling the eligibility criteria were contacted to participate in the survey through multiple ways: a) Sending formal invitation along with the objective questionnaire; b) Putting objective questionnaire on the websites of MDRA and India Today to increase awareness; c) Multiple reminders to the universities about timely participation and d) followups to clarify any doubts related to participation or questionnaire. As many as 133 universities provided their data along with voluminous supporting documents within the stipulated deadline for ranking purposes. Out of them, 130 were ranked as few universities were not eligible to participate this year. d) Back-check of the objective data: After receipt of the objective data from universities, cross-checking of the information provided was done carefully through available information and validation (scrutiny of supporting documents, past data, mandatory disclosure, telephonic check, asking confirmation through emails, website visits etc.). e) Perceptual survey was carried out among well-informed 300 respondents (32 V-Cs, 75 directors/ deans/ registrars, 193 senior faculty (professors)/ HoDs across 30 cities. Key cities: l North: Delhi-NCR, Lucknow, Jaipur, Chandigarh l West: Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Indore l South: Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Coimbatore l East: Kolkata, Guwahati and Patna National and zonal rankings were taken from them in their respective field of experience and were given 75 percent and 25 percent weightage respectively.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In this soccer season, most Indians are rueing the fact that a country of 1.3 billion people cannot produce 11 men to play in the football world cup. But that's not the only field India lags in globally. The state of university education is another one. In ancient times, universities such as Nal­anda and Taxila made India a centre of higher learning. Though there were many factors leading to a disruption of that historical legacy, the hard truth today is: of the 850 Indian universities, none features among the top 20 in any global ranking. The only solace is that 24 and 42 Indian universities found place among the top 1,000 universities of the world in the QS and the Times Higher Education ranking, respectively. The recently released QS Ranking, 2019, has placed three of our higher education institutions among the top 200 of the world. But instead of despairing, the stakeholders should strive towards the collective goal of creating a competitive environment, one which can inspire Indian universities to break into the top 100 and eventually secure positions among the top 20. The India Today Group-MDRA survey of India's best universities has been a step in that direction. ALSO READ | The best gets better In its fifth year, the survey has not only expanded its universe but also introduced a more robust process of scrutiny ( see methodology ). To create a level playing field, universities were divided into four categories -- general, technical, medical and law. Those universities which offer courses in multiple streams were considered under general category. Only the postgraduate courses offered by a university were evaluated for the ranking. The rigour applied in the examination of the performance of the universities have made the India Today university rankings the most credible and exhaustive survey in the country. The India Today survey has earned its name because it's done with credibility, transparency and with definite criteria, says Union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar. ALSO READ | Our philosophy is to fund and forget This year, we also invited some celebrated alumni of the top universities to write about their alma mater and the changes they have gone through over the years. They were unanimous in their concern about the decline in the quality of teachers in the universities, mainly due to the politicisation of university appointments and caste and region-based sel­ection processes. As a result, universities have been making news not for academic excellence, but for the wrong reasons. But more worrisome than poor app­ointments is the serious shortage of teachers. In January this year, Delhi University, one of the best in the country, reported a 48 per cent shortage in teachers -- of the 1,706 sanctioned positions, 805 were vacant. Since then, the university has appointed nearly 150 teachers. And Delhi University is not an isolated case. In all central universities, 33 per cent of teaching positions have not been filled up. In the central universities set up after 2009, 48 per cent teaching posts are vacant. READ | Think Inc The situation is the same in state and private universities. To overcome the shortage, the universities have resorted to hiring ad hoc or temporary teachers. Government universities do that because state governments repeatedly ignore pleas to sanction appointments while private universities have adopted this as a cost-cutting strategy as ad hoc teachers have to be paid less. This has seriously affected the quality of education. In a recent column, Furqan Qamar, secretary-general, Association of Indian Universities, made an interesting analysis of the teacher-student ratio in Indian and international universities. The universities which secure top positions in global rankings, on an average, enrol around 18,000 students each compared to an average of 11,000 students in top Indian universities. However, global top universities boast an average strength of 1,800 qualified faculty as against less than 600 in top Indian universities. SUGGESTED READ | A bar set high major factor in Indian universities not being among the global best is their poor performance in research and innovation. The Economic Survey, 2018, shows how India's R&D spend as a percentage of GDP has been stagnant at 0.6-0.7 per cent in the past two decades. Taking note of this, the Union government has introduced several schemes and monetary assistance to promote fundamental research in higher educational institutions. ALSO READ | Lofty AIIMS In a recent public interaction, noted economist Kaushik Basu argued that it's not advisable to see all universities through the same prism and that the government must select a few of them to build as research institutes of global repute. \"You can't run a country with 700 top-class universities. You will have to be prepared that 680 of those universities will be teaching shops, reasonably good, solid teaching. Twenty others will be research universities. People doing cutting-edge research, you give them space, research funding and support. I think India will take off then,\" he said. The Centre will soon announce the list of 20 institutes of eminence that have been selected for this. That will partly take care of Basu's suggestion. The next step will be to make the rest of the universities world-class \"teaching shops\", at the very least. YOU MAY ALSO READ | A system of rank inequalities"

The Indian higher education universe is one of the largest in the world—populated by more than 1,000 universities and 40,000 colleges, with 248 new universities added in the past seven years—yet its universities remain way below their potential on global benchmarks. There is no doubt among all stakeholders that India’s higher education system needs urgent implementation of reform."

Rahul Gandhi has also sent Congress general secretary KC Venugopal to Rajasthan. Venugopal has asked to seek explanation from Ashok Gehlot over the MLAs' rebellion, sources told India Today. According to sources, the MLAs who resigned on Sunday have put forth a three-point agenda. This includes the demand for a chief ministerial candidate from among the Gehlot loyalists. Gehlot camp MLAs have conveyed to the party high command emissaries, including Maken and Khadge, that deliberations on possible leadership change in Rajasthan should happen after the new Congress President is appointed. Third, Ashok Gehlot's choice should be taken into consideration."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story (NOTE: This is a reprint of a story that was published in the INDIA TODAY edition dated October 9, 2023) “Dhoni finishes it off in style...India wins the World Cup....” That was Ravi Shastri’s booming voice resonating across TV screens in the country as India lifted the 2011 World Cup in Mumbai. Twelve years later, the 50-overs World Cup is back on Indian soil, only this time the expectations are even higher than the six that lit up the Mumbai skyline. The relentless multi-media machine is already asking with breathless excitement: who will play the role of a Dhoni-style grand finisher and take India to the summit once again? How distinct is this boundless ambition and hype from the first time, when India travelled for the inaugural World Cup in England in 1975? Or indeed before India completed the ultimate underdog triumph in 1983? The ’75 World Cup is best remembered for Sunil Gavaskar’s bizarre innings of 36 runs in 60 overs. India’s greatest Test opener and a run machine, Gavaskar’s inexplicable run crawl is a reminder of just how clueless Indian cricketers were about the shorter format in the early years. Fast forward to 1983 when another Indian legend, Kapil Dev, transformed what seemed like a complete mismatch against the all-conquering West Indies into the most replayed moment in Indian sport (captured now forever in Hindi cinema in Kabir Khan’s film, ’83). Dev’s effervescence, on and off the field, instilled self-belief in India’s limited-overs skills and allowed Indian cricket fans to live a dream like no other. In 1983, it was the entirely unexpected nature of the win that spurred a euphoric response. But while the nation rejoiced, there was always the realisation that Lords ’83 was a bit of a freak, a once-in-a-generation moment that was unlikely to be repeated. By the time Dhoni’s team triumphed in 2011, cricket’s geographic power shift from West to East was almost complete. This, in turn, led many to hope, rather pray, that India would win the Cup on home turf. It was, after all, the last World Cup of unarguably India’s most-loved cricketer, Sachin Tendulkar. Cricket may be a team sport, but Indian fans are devoted to their superstar individuals and there has been no bigger cricket deity than the God of Cricket, the baby-faced teenage prodigy we had all grown up watching. A packed crowd chanting ‘Sachin, Sachin’ in frenzied unison became almost like a national cricket anthem for over two decades, culminating in a magical night at the Wankhede. A memorable quote of the 2011 triumph was from Sachin’s heir apparent, Virat Kohli, who summed up the feelings of the team: “He (Sachin) has carried the burden of the nation for 21 years, it was time we carried him.” Sachin, of course, has since retired into iconic Bharat Ratna status. Dhoni, that other great talisman of the 2011 triumph, still plays as a Chennai Superking folk hero, having permanently bridged Indian cricket’s north-south divide. In 2011, it was Dhoni’s calm and control that was crucial to victory in the final against Sri Lanka. Now the burden to achieve a hat-trick of World Cup successes falls on the worthy inheritor who lifted Sachin on his shoulders for the lap of honour in 2011. ‘King’ Kohli is already a sporting legend, having redefined Indian cricket by taking physical fitness and a never-say-die attitude to another level. He has established himself as arguably the greatest one-day cricketer of all time—statistically even ahead of West Indian master batsman Viv Richards—Kohli has a chance to rewrite the record books again: become the first Indian cricketer to win two World Cups in the 50-over format. Kohli’s presence in the side is a reminder that international sport is a baton relay where one generation mentors the next: new stars are emerging, but the old order isn’t calling it a day just yet. Captain Rohit Sharma made his debut in 2007, but 16 years later is, when on song, still the most devastating shotmaker in the team. Kohli and Sharma in partnership are a classy jugalbandi (duet) for purists, but the sport itself now plays to a very different beat. Cricket is no longer a languid sport played with a sense of timelessness as part of a gently unfolding drama. Five-day Test cricket is already facing an existential crisis, one reason why England’s recent free-spirited, positive approach (nicknamed ‘Bazball’ after their Kiwi coach Brendon McCullum) has won so many hearts. Even the relevance of the 50-over game is under the microscope: who really wants to see batsmen nudging the ball around for singles and twos in the middle overs any longer? White-ball cricket is now almost an unrecognisable sport, played with supersonic speed, where raw power, athleticism and fearless inventiveness are qualities to be treasured above all else. Amidst the proliferation of T20 leagues across the world, we now even have T10 tournaments and hundred balls per side contests attracting large crowds in an atmosphere akin to a high-decibel rock concert. Not to forget the unimaginable riches that have come with corporate support: last year’s IPL sensation Rinku Singh will probably earn more in a season playing for his franchise than Kapil Dev’s entire India career payout. The best cricketers are typically adjusting their talents to this gilded age: Indian cricket is now routinely throwing up top-class players who hit the ball harder and further than their predecessors (albeit armed with much better bats) and skillful bowlers who have mastered a far greater variety of deliveries, especially in the crucial death overs. Watching a Shubman Gill—the gen-next batting champion—smash fast bowlers for six after having leant into a gorgeous on drive the previous ball or a Jasprit Bumrah bowl a well-disguised slower delivery after having just delivered a rapid bouncer is to celebrate the genius of players with extraordinary skill sets. Not to forget a potential game-changer in Kuldeep Yadav, who is an old-style spinning sorcerer slowly perfecting one of cricket’s most difficult art forms: left-arm wrist spin. Importantly, the sport is far more ‘democratised’ and aspirational than ever before: the players who will represent the country in the World Cup come from amazingly diverse backgrounds. The meteoric rise of a Mohammed Siraj, son of an autorickshaw driver, from playing tennis ball cricket on the streets of old Hyderabad to now being a much-feared new ball bowler, is the great Indian cricket dream to cherish. As is that of his fast-bowling senior, Mohammed Shami, who played his early cricket in a remote UP village. When the teams line up, a commerce graduate, K.L. Rahul, will stand alongside a class nine dropout in Hardik Pandya: the only qualification on the cricket field is merit, not lineage. The cash-rich Indian cricket board may still be run by an opaque, unaccountable clique of politically well-connected VIPs, but the sport itself is a joyous reflection of an ‘equal opportunities’ society. So, will this impressively assembled ‘new India’ team win the 2023 World Cup? It most certainly can. But winning a global tournament can be a matter of fine margins: recall the enthralling last World Cup final which was won on a peculiar boundary count-back rule. Both England and New Zealand were tied on scores, but England won it after a super-over because they had hit more boundaries. The sport is also more competitive than ever before: every team in this World Cup, with the possible exception of the Netherlands, will go into every game in this tournament believing they can win. Teams like Australia, England and Pakistan are brimming with match-winning players, while even a plucky Afghanistan could come charging down the Khyber Pass to pull off a surprise or two. But here is the good news: the last three World Cups have been won by the host nations. If Rohit Sharma and his men in blue can handle the pressure of massive expectations, there is no reason why we can’t have another incandescent night on finals day on November 19, this time at the Narendra Modi stadium in Ahmedabad. After the luminosity of Chandrayaan and the buzz of a G20 summit, a World Cup win at a stadium named after the prime minister might give even more momentum to the BJP’s ‘Rising India’ drumbeat ahead of the general election. But for the next few weeks at least, bruising political propaganda battles can wait as the cricketers take centre stage. A carnival of cricket awaits us. Enjoy the spectacle. —Rajdeep Sardesai is consulting editor, TV Today, and author of ‘Democracy’s XI: The Great Indian Cricket Story’ Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Telangana Congress chief Revanth Reddy, widely credited as the man who delivered the state for the party, has been named the next Chief Minister. Briefing the press on Tuesday evening, Congress General Secretary KC Venugopal said Revanth Reddy will be the new Congress Legislature Party chief in Telangana. \"He is experienced, works with all and has already given promise to the people of Telangana with guarantees,\" Venugopal said. The swearing-in ceremony will take place on Thursday, December 7. In a post on X, Revanth Reddy thanked the Congress leadership for showing faith in him. \"I wholeheartedly express my gratitude to honourable AICC president Shri @kharge ji, Mother of Telangana our beloved #Soniamma , ever inspiring leader @RahulGandhi ji, charismatic @priyankagandhi ji, AICC General Secretary (Org) @kcvenugopalmp ji, deputy CM of Karnataka @DKShivakumar ji and Incharge General Secretary- Telangana @Manikrao_INC ji and last but not the least our congress soldiers who stood by us through thick and thin (sic),\" he said. Senior Congress leaders Uttam Kumar Reddy and Bhatti Vikramarka might be given a Deputy Chief Minister post or would be accommodated on a good portfolio. Sources said there would be no rotational Chief Minister formula in the state. A seasoned politician and Lok Sabha MP from Malkajgiri, Revanth Reddy has been a pivotal figure in Telangana politics . His transition from the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) to the Congress in 2017 marked a significant shift in the state's political dynamics. As a two-time MLA and now the face of the Congress in Telangana, Reddy's aggressive campaign strategies and direct confrontations with Chief Minister KCR have made him a crowd favourite and established him as a potential chief ministerial candidate. Reddy's street protests and public rallies alongside central Congress figures have bolstered his image as a tenacious challenger to the incumbent BRS government. His colloquial and relatable rhetoric resonated with voters across Telangana, enhancing his appeal beyond his constituency. The Congress celebrated in Telangana as the party crossed the majority mark of 60 seats in the 119-member state Assembly, ousting the ruling K Chandrasekhar Rao-led Bharat Rashtra Samithi government. KCR tendered his resignation as Chief Minister to the state Governor. Congress won 64 seats while the BRS won 39 seats."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is unlikely to contest the Lok Sabha elections, sources told India Today TV, amid the ongoing suspense over the party's picks for the high-profile Amethi and Raebareli Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh. The sources also said that Priyanka Gandhi would only campaign for the elections and a final decision on C ongress MP Rahul Gandhi contesting from Amethi or Raebareli will be taken in 24 hours. The development comes a day after sources told India Today TV that Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge was suggested at the party's Central Election Committee meeting to make the Gandhi siblings the candidates Amethi and Raebareli . At the meeting, Congress leaders, including the general secretary-in-charge of Uttar Pradesh, strongly pitched for Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi as the party's candidates, they added. Both Amethi and Raebareli will go to the polls on May 20. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Union Minister Smriti Irani defeated Rahul Gandhi in Amethi , a Congress bastion which he had represented from 2004 to 2014. Rahul Gandhi is seeking a second term from the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat in Kerala this year, which went to the polls on April 26. Meanwhile, former Congress president Sonia Gandhi vacated the Raebareli seat she had represented since 2004 earlier this month due to her shift to the Rajya Sabha. The Amethi-Raebareli suspense was brought up at a press conference on April 27, where Kharge was asked about the BJP criticising Rahul Gandhi for fighting the elections from Wayanad instead of Amethi. In response, the Congress president said, \"Those questioning Congress leaders for changing constituencies must also tell me how many times have (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee and (Lal Krishna) Advani changed their seats.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In the last week or so, I've been repeatedly asked a question that's pregnant with all kinds of possibilities. Is the 2024 general election turning away from the BJP? You see, the general impression a month ago was that the 2024 elections were a done deal, that nothing could stop a Modi-led BJP from a hattrick of wins. But now, low voter turnout in some parts of the country, ground-level anti-incumbency, the Prime Minister’s increasingly strident speeches, references to Adani, Ambani and black money, jittery markets have convinced more than a few people –mainly those who, dare I say, desperately want Prime Minister Modi to be defeated and see an end of 'Modi Raj' – that this election is turning out to be a bit like 2004. Remember that election when a frontrunner suddenly appeared to struggle? And at the end of the race, it was a seeming backbencher who quickly caught up. So has anything changed in the last few weeks as we've reached the halfway stage of Lok Sabha 2024? Here are my 10 takeaways as this election reaches the halfway point: 1. BJP’s ‘Abki baar 400 paar’ dream is over You would think the 400 mark was always a bit of a jumla designed to intimidate the Opposition into giving up even before the race began. The BJP and its allies are not, as of now, getting 400 or anywhere close to it. That euphoria is gone, and so is the bombast of ‘Abki baar 400 paar’. 2. Abki baar no national storyline This is a very strange election without any dominant narrative from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. Fearmongering about Muslim reservations, for example, no longer has a national resonance. Neither does the Opposition's demand for a cast census. In 2014, there was an overwhelming desire for change. In 2019, a muscular leadership was fore-grounded. Now, the more silent voter shows a mix of hope, discontent and, fatigue. I've met families where the mother will tell me that Mr Modi has raised India's global image, while the daughter tells me she's worried about securing a good job. The mother is looking at the future with confidence, the daughter with some amount of concern, when actually it should be the other way around. 3. Abki baar Maharashtra, Karnataka mein problem hai yaar Both states have witnessed much political turbulence in recent years, and on the ground. These are the two states where the Modi factor is being overwhelmed by localised battles and, especially in Maharashtra, by poor choice of allies. Don't forget, these are the two states which have also seen much agrarian distress in recent times. Mangalsutra politics, frankly, has limited traction here when real issues like water scarcity are not addressed on an urgent basis. 4. Abki baar no whitewash in Rajasthan, Haryana and Bihar In 2019 elections, the BJP got 25 out of 25 in Rajasthan, 10 out of 10 in Haryana, 39 out of 40 in Bihar. While the BJP is still the number one party in all these states, no clean sweep seems to be happening this time. Once again, we are seeing local caste community arithmetic that is undercutting the Modi effect. 5. Abki baar vote share mein loss, seats not sure The BJP won 224 seats in 2019 by getting 50 per cent vote share. That won’t be easy to replicate, but it does give the BJP a huge head start over its rivals. While the Opposition is catching up in terms of votes, I don’t see too many seats shifting, especially in central India, in states like Madhya Pradesh, or in west India like Gujarat. These are the BJP’s “banker states”. Even in Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP is facing a tougher than expected fight in some pockets, vote share is declining, but seats may not shift much. 6. Abki baar Modi is not the only key The BJP won the 2019 polls on the Modi brand power. This time, as the elections get tied into local battles, Modi’s image – and make no mistake he is still very popular – isn’t always proving to be enough. The Prime Minister’s speeches don’t receive the kind of euphoric response they once did. Instead, it’s the BJP's formidable electoral machine on the ground – the booth workers, the panna pramukhs , the Shakti Kendra and mandal heads – each of whom are a well-oiled, resourceful machine. In the end, last-mile connectivity matters and this is where the BJP still has the edge, especially in direct contests with the Congress, whose on the ground machine is still rusty in several key states. 7. Abki baar Modi versus who remains an unanswered question Rahul Gandhi’s “samvidhan khatre mein hai” (Constitution is in danger) is gathering traction, especially among Dalit youth, but there is still very little coordination within the INDIA alliance and there are still too many opposition leaders who speak out of turn. In this social media age, the slightest slip-up is ruthlessly exploited. So when a leader speaks of a 'vote jihad' or someone else seeks a discussion on inheritance tax, or someone questions the 26/11 terror attack, be sure the Modi machine will exploit the full tosses offered. Especially when the field is full of friendly media players ever ready to target the opposition for any slip-up. For the urban middle class, stable leadership is still Modi’s USP. 8. Abki baar Ram nahi, rashan The BJP went into this election on the back of its Ram Mandir elation. There was a belief that Ram Lalla would deliver the votes. Guess what? It’s not Ram, but ration that’s probably saving them from creeping anti-incumbency. The poor are fatigued and disillusioned, steady rozgaar (employment) remains a major concern. But they at least have 5 kg of free ration in their homes. That’s the one factor that could yet count in the end. The ‘labharthi’ or beneficiary voter is Modi’s trump card. 9. Abki baar Mahila matters, not Muslims The Hindu-Muslim dog whistles might help the BJP consolidate its core voters but the real key vote bank is the Mahila. The woman voter is proving decisive. The Modi government may not have delivered on the jobs front but women-centric welfare schemes are still seen as a strong suit for his government. Women are the PM’s potential brahmastra . 10. Abki baar Mission 272, not 400 In a sense, the wheel has come full circle. In 2014, when PM Modi first came to power, the entire chatter was around whether the BJP could get a simple majority on its own -- Mission 272 as it was called. Now, the BJP is back to its original mission: forget 400 paar, it's now about 272 paar. The key is to minimise losses in Maharashtra, Bihar and Karnataka, keep UP intact, add a few in Odisha, Assam, keep fingers crossed on Bengal and Rajasthan and hope that all else falls in place. Will it happen? Yes, for now, the BJP remains in pole position but the gap isn’t as wide as it was maybe a few months ago. Could anything change? Unlikely. But when you set 400 as your initial target and are now playing for 280, then you know you can’t afford any more mistakes. The 2024 election pitch has turned but very slowly. Always remember, there are two teams who bat on a wicket. And while the BJP no longer looks like a world-beating side, the Opposition still isn’t playing like a team that can cause a big upset."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Lok Sabha election results have been anything but boring. What most expected to be yet another power performance by the BJP, turned out to be a stunning fightback by the Congress which saw its numbers soar from 52 seats in 2019 to 99 this time. Despite coming back for a record third term and with Narendra Modi days away from being sworn in as Prime Minister, the BJP rode on the back of its allies to achieve the feat. Chandrababu Naidu's Telugu Desam Party and Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United) have emerged as kingmakers in the new government, a ' mili juli sarkar ' (coalition government). The NDA managed to win 293 seats, 21 more than the majority mark of 272, as opposed to the Congress-led INDIA bloc's 234 - what most exit polls failed to forecast. The INDIA alliance's impressive victory in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, two of the BJP's strongholds, showed the changing political landscape of the country. India Today's Consulting Editor Rajdeep Sardesai shared his takeaways from the election results in his vlog 'Straight Bat' This is a midweek special because this has been a special week. The week when India has counted and the general elections of 2024 have thrown up quite a remarkable verdict. A verdict that few would have predicted just a couple of days ago. All the exit pollsters have got it horribly wrong. And the reality is that at the end of the day, we now have what they would call, a ' mili juli sarkar ', a coalition government which will be headed by the BJP. There are plenty of takeaways that I have for you from this historic verdict that has been delivered by the wonderful people of this great country called India, that is Bharat. Takeaway 1: The people of India have reflected the unique diversity of this country. This was an election which can be best described as a state-by-state competition. The BJP was keen to make it presidential--from Kashmir to Kanniyakumari--only one name, Narendra Modi and ' Modi Ki guarantee '. The truth of the matter is, voters in different states have voted on different issues. The voters in Maharashtra have voted differently to those in neighbouring Gujarat, and the voters in Uttar Pradesh have voted differently to those in Bihar, across the Hindi heartland. From Bengal to Odisha, different voting patterns.From Andhra to Tamil Nadu, different voting patterns again. Diversity has won over uniformity. The attempt to suggest that India is a single leader, single party, single nation has been squarely rejected by the Indian voters, which is why they have reflected, in a way, their desire for a more accommodative coalition -- a mili juli sarkar . Because, my friends, this great country is a coalition after all. Takeaway 2: The BJP is undoubtedly party number one and Narendra Modi remains leader number one. It is not easy to beat back 10 years of anti-incumbency after being in power and then still complete a hat-trick. The last leader to do that was the great Jawaharlal Nehru. Competition, perhaps, was much less. Despite that frenzied competition, Modi, in all likelihood, will become the Prime Minister of the country yet again. So, there's no doubt that the BJP remains party number one, pan India, winning a seat in Kerala, for example, for the first time. But, and this is important but, if the BJP thinks that purely banking on the Modi name will win it elections any more, they're sadly mistaken. We've seen that in this election very clearly. The choice of candidates, the unwillingness to take people along, murmurs of dissent, even in Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath was unhappy with the choice of candidates. The manner in which the BJP leadership believed that purely brand Modi was enough to win an election (is) not happening any more. There are local factors that will have to be accounted for. The BJP itself will have to be a little bit more humble when it deals with the leadership, when it deals with its karyakartas (workers) across the country. Takeaway 3: The voters have rejected the arrogance of power. ‘Ab ki bar 400 paar' was a drumbeat for the last few months, almost as if it was a done deal. This time, the voter, 'Consult us as well when you say 400 paar'. The BJP appeared to have taken this election, some would say, or at least the voters, at one level, for granted with that ' 400 paar ' slogan, and it came back to bite them in some way or the other. Arrogance of power was reflected in various ways. Look at the way parties were broken in Maharashtra, for example. Deal-making was done almost as if the voter or the citizens' concerns didn't matter at all. The people of states like Maharashtra have sent a message – ‘Enough is enough. There are limits to deal-making’. In Amethi, Smriti Irani, who had worked hard on the ground, was defeated by Kishori Lal Sharma of the Congress, a faceless worker, simply because the latter was seen as someone who was always available to the people. Smriti Irani was a high-flying minister, and not all karkyakarta s (party workers) were happy with her style of functioning, apparently. The voter responded to the arrogance of power. Another example was Jagan Mohan Reddy arresting N Chandrababu Naidu at the age of 73. That arrest, if anything, seemed to have triggered sympathy for Naidu last year. Takeaway 4: Mandal 2.0 has in some way trumped Mandir of the 21st century. The BJP lost in Faizabad where Ayodhya is, where the Ram Mandir is located, where its candidate, Lallu Singh, lost to a Samajwadi Party candidate who belongs to the Pasi community. Someone had once told me about a popular Hindi slogan there, ' Na Mathura, na Kashi, Ayodhya mein Pasi ’. There are caste identities that can sometimes undercut this belief that there is a Hindu monolith, especially the caste that still exists at the bottom of the social pyramid. In that sense, Akhilesh Yadav was successful in sending out the message that his new PDA combine -- Pichhda, Dalit and Alpsankhyak (Backward Classes, Dalits and Minorities) -- was a wider social coalition. Takeaway 5: The Dalit voter. It's very interesting that in more than 90 of the 150 Dalit-dominated constituencies - where Dalits comprise more than 20 per cent of the population - a large chunk of them went with the INDIA alliance. So, those at the bottom of the pyramid, those who were really hurt by Covid, post-Covid distress and falling incomes, needed people to reach out to them. And often many of their MPs didn't perhaps reach out to them during those times. I know that Dalits were also being influenced by this whole discourse of 'Samvidhaan khatre mein hai' , reservations will go, but truly, I believe it was also not just a caste but a class issue. That those at the bottom of the pyramid who are people, who are victims of an unequal society, were the ones who are calling for comfort and compassion. And they were not getting that form of compassionate governance. Takeaway 6: The next takeaway is the sharpening rural-urban divide in the country. It’s in several parts of rural India that actually anti-incumbency was at its strongest. I travelled through Maharashtra and you could see it. Conditions of drought over a couple of years, water scarcity, some farmers complaining about restrictions on onion exports, others complaining that they were not getting remunerative prices. Rural distress is real and is often disconnected with GDP numbers. On the ground, the reality is often very different: rural distress, be it in falling incomes or water scarcity, was a real factor. Takeaway 7: The Mahila voter. I mentioned this in a blog, a few weeks ago, and I repeat it. You can't win an Indian election comprehensively without the support of the mahila (women) voter. The women in different parts of the state reflect the diversity of this country. Which is why, for example, in some parts of the country, they may well back the BJP and the Prime Minister on 5-kg ration or an Awas Yojana scheme or Ujjwala scheme. But in Bengal they may back Mamata Banerjee for her Lakhir Bhandar scheme, where she provides Rs 1,200 to a woman in a household. And that may be an important reason why Mamata Banerjee was able to stave off anti-incumbency in Bengal. So the woman voter, the power of 49, remains a key factor in Indian elections. Takeaway 8: Also, what works in Indian elections is alliance politics. When you strike alliances intelligently, they work. The BJP was able to do it in Karnataka with the JD(S) and managed to corner a substantial Vokkaliga (caste) vote. The BJP struck an alliance with Chandrababu Naidu, and they benefitted from it. The BJP, for example, in Bihar got Nitish Kumar back into the fold, Chirag Paswan into the alliance and and they were able to, in a sense, retain a dominant position in Bihar. By contrast, in Maharashtra, it's an unnatural BJP-led alliance. The same Ajit Pawar the BJP called corrupt was brought in. So, alliance politics may work in one state, it doesn't work in the other. Ditto with the INDIA alliance: the alliance between Akhilesh (Yadav) and Rahul Gandhi worked in UP, but the alliance didn't work in Delhi between AAP and Congress because there was no chemistry on the ground. It worked in Maharashtra for the MVA because Sharad Pawar held it together. Alliance politics requires arithmetic and chemistry. And if the INDIA alliance had ensured that Nitish didn't leave it, or reached out to Chandrababu Naidu, who knows what might have happened? Takeaway 9: The north-south divide about which there was so much talk before the election. The truth of the matter is the divide is slowly but surely finding ways of receding politically. You are seeing the BJP grow slowly in parts of southern India. A first ever seat won in Kerala, a major party in Karnataka, a strong showing in Telangana, and they are a part now of a ruling alliance in Andhra Pradesh. Similarly, the INDIA and the Congress, which was almost demolished in the Hindi heartland in 2019 and 2014, has shown some signs of recovery. Politics is never static, the map of the country keeps changing. Takeaway 10: Speaking of the Congress, my next takeaway, the Congress is ending up with around 100 seats, 99 to be exact. For a party which got 52 seats last time, that's almost double, and there is a reason to believe that Rahul Gandhi has had a major role to play in the party revival. His yatra certainly galvanised the Congress supporters. It gave the Congress a narrative to speak on. By raising issues of caste and inequality, of concentration of wealth, of holding out ‘khatakhat’ promise of guarantees, the Congress reach out to marginalised sections may well have worked, and Rahul Gandhi deserves some credit. But the worry is that Congress will get typically complacent. The fact is, you're still well behind the BJP. So, the Congress is going to have to double its energies, double its efforts, and improve its organisational strength if it really wants to take on the BJP. Takeaway 11: Let me turn to two last points, which really are personal, which I feel strongly about. One is religion. Right through this election, we've seen an attempt being made to bring in the toxicity of religion into the election campaign. 'Mangalsutra, machli, mutton, mujra' - the kind of language that's been used is deplorable. Lies like reservation benefits will go only to Muslims, 'woh aapki bhains cheen lenge' - what kind of language and discourse is this? This attempt to bring in religion into politics is dangerous in a plural country like India. We have one of the largest Muslim populations in the world, and the challenge of India and the charm of India is when we are able to reconcile rather than polarise. And somewhere when I went across this country, I was reassured, particularly by the young, that they are tiring of this Hindu- Muslim narrative, and they want you to talk about their real issues. Talk about rozgar, unemployment. Along with rural distress, unemployment was a major factor, which is why a number of voters from 18 to 23 age groups voted against the incumbent. That's the issue which you need to address, real issues. Mehangai (inflation), unemployment, not talk constantly about Hindu-Muslim and demonise a community. Takeaway 12: Which brings me, as I conclude, to the fact that I really, at the end of the day, want to celebrate that we are this remarkably diverse country in the world. We are not in the end a China like remote controlled system. Everyone says democracy is dead, democracy ' khatre mein hai ' (in danger). The voter has shown and spoken, the faceless silent voter, often at the bottom of the pyramid, often living on just Rs 6,000 a month, ‘I will show you what democracy is'. It's perhaps the fat cats who don't even vote, who have seceded from electoral democracy. So don’t the poor, humble, anonymous Indian voter who still comes out and votes in soaring temperatures and sends out strong messages to his or her netas. As I end, I want to give you a post script today. I don't know whether I will ever do another election. Maybe I will, maybe I won't. Who knows? Maybe retirement beckons. But either way, I wanted to say this to some of my media friends and colleagues: For much too long, all I have seen in the last several years is what I call ‘damru’ journalism, beating the drumbeat of one leader, one party, constantly creating Hindu-Muslim fissures in slanging matches in television studios. We need to give up the noise and come back to the news. We need to tell the real issues, not just once in five years when we go on our election travels, but more regularly. The people of this country need a strong, vibrant and independent media, and this is our opportunity to restore public faith in the media. Whether the opposition does it or not, we in the media must remain the country's perennial opposition, always telling the truth to power, whoever is in power from whichever party. That, my friends, is, in a way, a message that perhaps the voters are sending to us in the media too. They, too, want us to somewhere course correct. Jai Hind."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story I personally love the concept of micro-cars and when MG launched the little Comet, I was all too excited to drive it. However, much as is the case with most test vehicles, we get limited time to try it out. Now though, I am extremely glad that MG has sent the Comet for a Long Term Test. The Comet which has arrived is a brand-new vehicle with just 87km on the clock. The variant we have is the top-of-the-line Plush one and that means our little test vehicle is fully loaded with goodies. The car comes in this unique Apple Green shade which, coupled with the black roof, is surely a head-turner. Then there are the features inside, which include a 10.2in infotainment system which is ready for Android and Apple devices. I am particularly in love with the all-digital instrument panel. Apart from the usual bits, the display also houses a graphic of a Comet which plays out all the light functionalities. Too cute! Powering the Comet is a 17.3kWh battery pack which offers a range of 230km. There are three drive modes too, which can be used to exploit the electric motor which offers 42bhp and 110Nm of torque. Loaded to the gill is what the Plush variant is. The quality also feels rather premium and the AC too cooled the large cabin with ease. Keyless go is another favourite for me. me alread Overall, then the Comet surely feels well loaded for daily use. Over the past few days, I have undertaken ‘long journeys’ which include 150km drives across the city, and at no time have I undergone ‘range anxiety’. In fact, even after such a long drive, I was able to return home where I put the car on charge, only to return to see a fully charged Comet ready for the next day. Other interesting bits of the Comet include its turning radius. The little MG with all the light motifs looks too cool. The little car can nearly turn around on its axis and this means driving through the city felt like a breeze. Parking, too, isn’t an issue as it takes very little space and this means that I could park it in places where bigger cars would never dare. Adding to it is the extremely light steering wheel. Over the course of the next few months, be ready to read through how this little car behaves on a daily basis. This is going to be fun."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Royal Enfield Himalayan is finally a part of the Auto Today fleet, and that too in Hanle black! Gold wheels and everything. Ever since I first swung a leg over one in Manali late last year, I’ve been dying to ride one on the day-to-day, and it’s finally here. Over the next few months, we are going to put the seeming all-rounder to the test, on the highway, in the city and of course off-road. We are going to talk about reliability, comfort and long-term quality, although I will admit that expectations are high after that first ride experience. But for this month, let’s talk a little about the new Himalayan and what comes as part of the package. 43mm Showa big-piston shocks have 220mm of travel and do a great job of damping and compression both on and off the beaten track. This motorcycle is after all brand new from the ground up. It has got a new motor, the very first liquid-cooled Royal Enfield in history, that makes 40bhp and 40Nm of torque from a refined 452cc single. It has a 4.5-inch TFT instrument set that features RE’s first casting dash that allows media interfacing as well as Maps casting that’s integrated seamlessly. The new chassis that uses the engine as a stressed member is suspended between Showa springs, the gold wheels though tubed for now will soon be tubeless, it’s all very premium for the asking price. Over the next few months, we’ll focus on each aspect not just in terms of performance but also utility."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Maruti Suzuki India introduced two new SUVs, the Fronx and the Jimny, in FY24. The company also sells SUVs like the Brezza and the Grand Vitara. While the Fronx, Brezza and Grand Vitara have churned out handsome performances, the Jimny has failed to meet the expectations, clocking disappointing volumes. The India-spec five-door Maruti Suzuki Jimny was developed with an investment of around Rs 960 crore. It was launched in June 2024, two months after the Maruti Suzuki Fronx entered the market in April 2024. Expectations from Maruti cars are very high when it comes to volumes. The company's models, like the WagonR, Swift, Baleno, Dzire, Fronx, Brezza, Grand Vitara and Ertiga are among the largest-selling in India. However, Jimny clocked wholesales of merely 17,009 units in FY24. In comparison, the Fronx recorded volumes of 134,735 units, the Brezza of 169,897 units and the Grand Vitara of 121,169 units. Maruti was even offering discounts of up to Rs 2.21 lakh on the Jimny in December 2023. There is no doubt that Jimny is a very capable off-roader . However, potential buyers have expressed concerns over its pricing. According to our dealer sources, customers are finding the cost of the vehicle to be steep. Besides, the Maruti Suzuki Jimny's road presence is not as robust as that of its direct rival, the Mahindra Thar. The Jimny is priced between Rs 12.74 lakh and Rs 14.95 lakh (ex-showroom). The Thar, which has more powertrain options, sits in the price bracket of Rs 11.35 lakh to Rs 17.60 lakh (ex-showroom). The Jimny has continued its FY24's poor performance in the current fiscal, garnering wholesales of 257 units in April 2024 and 274 units in May 2024. At the heart of the Jimny is the old K15B 1.5-litre petrol engine, which produces 105PS of maximum power and 134Nm of peak torque. The transmission options include 5-speed MT and 4-speed AT. Based on a ladder frame chassis, the SUV has ALLGRIP PRO 4WD technology with low-range transfer gear (4L mode) as standard."

The value stood at Rs 8.6 lakh crore in FY23. As per the report, there was a rise of 39% y-o-y in overall value for the sport utility vehicle (SUV) and utility vehicle (UV) segments. Their volume increased by 23% y-o-y and price by 16% y-o-y. The average price increase was due to a general rise in prices; shift to higher segments, hybrids and automatics; popularity of sunroof models and electric vehicles (EVs). The passenger vehicle (PV) segment saw a decline of 9% y-o-y in volumes due to a slight price increase, resulting in a 4% value drop. In the two-wheeler segment, India witnessed a 10% y-o-y increase in volume and 13% y-o-y in value, while the three-wheeler segment grew by 16% y-o-y in volume and 24% y-o-y in value. The commercial vehicle (CV) segment rose by 3% y-o-y in volume and 7% y-o-y in value. \"India is at the forefront in leading the global automobile race, bypassing lower-priced products and creating more value in feature-rich, higher-priced vehicles. Consumer preferences and robust economic fundamentals are drivers of this transformation in the Indian automobile industry. Significantly, the UV and SUV segments are becoming a preferred choice for most Indian consumers,\" said Anurag Singh, Managing Director, Primus Partners.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In a segment dominated by the likes of the Hyundai Creta, Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara, Kia Seltos and Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder, the MG Astor has failed to make a mark, as witnessed by the volumes it has posted in the past two years. The Astor was launched in India in October 2021. The mid-size SUV clocked wholesales of 8,734 units in FY22, according to data from the industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). The volumes jumped to 15,601 units in FY23. However, they slipped to 10,569 units in FY24. If we consider the MG Astor's performance in two previous fiscals, it was the lowest selling model in the mid-size SUV segment in FY23 and FY24. The vehicle sold fewer units than the Skoda Kushaq and the Volkswagen Taigun, which are themselves not major volume churners in the mid-size SUV segment. Source - SIAM The Astor has not started even FY25 on a great scale with combined volumes of just 2,010 units in April and May, in comparison to 30,109 units of the Creta, 17,387 units of the Grand Vitara, 13,470 units of the Seltos, 10,269 units of the Urban Cruiser Hyryder, 3,319 units of the Taigun, 3,284 units of the Elevate and 2,315 units of the Kushaq. Although the mid-size SUV segment witnesses high volumes, it is a highly competitive space. According to industry experts, the arrival of new models like the Grand Vitara, Hyryder and Elevate, has impacted the Astor's volumes. During the pandemic, like all other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), MG Motor India also faced semiconductor supply constraints. This, in turn, hurt Astor's production. The experts are of the view that MG Motor India's link to China's SAIC Motor hit the sales of the Astor and other models of the company. While SAIC Motor earlier held a 100% stake in MG Motor India, the Chinese firm announced a strategic joint venture with Indian conglomerate JSW Group in November 2023. Under the pact, JSW Group acquired a 35% stake in newly-formed JSW MG Motor India. The MG Astor has a couple of engine options -- 1.5-litre NA petrol (110PS and 144Nm) and 1.4-litre turbo petrol (140PS and 220Nm). The NA petrol unit gets 5-speed MT and CVT choices, while the turbo petrol unit only has a 6-speed AT. The MG Astor price starts at Rs 9.98 lakh and goes up to Rs 18.28 lakh (ex-showroom)."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupe is the latest Merc to receive a minor facelift in the German automaker’s stable. Unlike earlier, when the GLE Coupe was also available with the big V8 powered ‘63’ guise alongside the 53, the only one currently on sale in India is the less spirited 53, which has a six-cylinder under the hood. While the overall look is the same as before, the aggressive AMG grille and the sporty bumper below have been slightly reprofiled.The LED headlamps and the DRLs are new as well. Just like all the other Mercedes-Benz cars which have been updated in the last year or so, the GLE 53 now sports new LED DRLs with four pods and a long brow on the top, which is more or less exactly the same as the new GLE SUV. There is a new AMG emblem on the bonnet, while the grille and the front bumper have been slightly altered to go in with the refreshed look. The GLE 53 continues with its SUV-coupe design, which is a look that many might not prefer but it has certified road presence. The SUV Coupe is exactly same in its silhouette, with the tapering roofline, muscled panels and the 21-inch alloys with the 315mm rear tyres giving the it size and butch appeal, that not even proper SUVs can match. While it may not be a look which a lot of people prefer, there is no denying that it has certified road presence, that does make heads turn, either in applause or in distaste. The cabin is typical Mercedes, but for that AMG flavour you do get sporty elements peppered all around the interior. The cabin is typical Mercedes-Benz, but to add the AMG flavour, you do get some sporty trim elements, like the carbon fibre trim on some areas but the biggest change compared to before is the new AMG steering. This is present on a number of other AMGs and comes with a full touch interface, which requires some getting used to and the ‘accidental’ touch while driving is quite commonplace. The touch-based controls on the steering require some getting used to. There are two AMG controls on the dials, which are configurable and add to the sporty-leaning of the GLE 53. There are two dedicated control dials for the AMG modes – the right one manages the driving modes while the left one offers several custom settings. The GLE 53 ensures that it has enough comfort and tech to pass as a Mercedes-Benz. It gets fully adjustable front seats with heating and cooling, multizone climate control, temperature-controlled cup holders, wireless smartphone charger , ensuring a pampered experience. The GLS inspired aircon vents look great while the infotainment display comes with AMG-specific screens. Add to this the latest-gen MBUX, Burmester audio, offroad display with transparent bonnet, wireless smartphone mirroring and a big number of USB-C ports, including a 100W one in the centre and the GLE 53 doesn’t really miss out on anything. The only thing that one might find to be a bit of a drawback is the comfort of the seats, which are AMG firm, and the space in the rear, which while plenty might not be enough for taller individuals, courtesy of the roofline. Mercedes-Benz has put in the second gen ISG, which adds 20bhp and 200Nm of torque to the six-cylinder engine. But what this car is really about is performance, which comes from the mass-produced M256 3.0-litre straight-six, which is tuned to produce 435bhp and 560Nm of torque, more than what the motor does in models like the GLE 450. The intent of the powertrain is apparent right from the moment one presses the ignition, as the engine comes alive with quite a throaty roar from the adjustable exhaust system, albeit some of which is routed via the excellent Burmester speakers. Rotate the dials, put the car into Sport+ and the GLE 53 takes off, dispatching the 0 to 100 sprint in 5 seconds, which is faster than before, as Mercedes-Benz has put in the second gen ISG, which adds 20bhp and 200Nm of torque, and this does make car much more responsive, irrespective whether you’re in traffic or pushing it hard. Zero to 100kmph comes up in five seconds, which is fast. But it is the way that the GLE 53 accelerates, loud, and like a battleship that you might get addicted to flooring it at every traffic stop. And if you do find wide enough corners, the GLE 53 has the ability to scorch the tarmac. The responsive motor, 9-speed automatic, 4Matic+ AWD and intelligent air suspension ensure that it can go around corners like a much smaller, and lighter car - the GLE 53 weighs 2.3 tonnes, and is almost 5 metres in length! All the AMG trickery is so sorted that you can be taking corners at precarious speeds, and yet you’d be seated more or less upright, that too with a soft ride. It is fairly forgiving, but push it too hard, and it does remind you of its size and weight, and despite having big brakes and ample stopping power, early braking is something one must practise with the GLE 53. Drive it around with everything dialled down, and the GLE 53 isn’t much different to all the luxury SUVs that Mercedes-Benz has been treating us to all these years. The GLE 53 has an updated rear which mainly includes reprofiled lighting elements in the taillamp. Its quite comfortable, its very spacious and on the highways this is a pure mile muncher, just with a particular level of stiffness that is to be expected from the AMG stable. The GLE 53 is a fine blend of luxury and comfort which will satiate those who need the hallmark Mercedes comfort for their daily commute, while having enough performancy bits (and a loud exhaust) to put a smile on your face every time you depress the pedal. The GLE 53 currently is priced at Rs 1.85 crore (ex-showroom), which is a bump of 65 lakhs over the older car. The update doesn’t really justify the price hike, but appears to be the brand’s belief in its loyal customer base. It primarily competes with the Porsche Cayenne Coupe and the Audi Q8, but does trump both its German rivals in terms of performance, comfort and luxury."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Hero MotoCorp recently added a new member to its family, and before you make any assumptions, no, we aren’t talking about the Mavrick 440. We’re talking about the ‘other’ new motorcycle to come from the home-grown manufacturer’s stable - Xtreme 125R. It is now the smallest member of the Xtreme family, which currently consists of the faired Xtreme 200S 4V along with the 160 and 160 4V street motorcycles. So, where does the 125R fit into the mix? Well, for starters, it is meant to be a commuter with a sporty angle to it, or maybe it’s the other way around? To get a low down on what exactly is the Xtreme 125R, we took it out for a spin. But before diving into the ride experience, let’s dive deeper into the kind of features it has to offer along with the overall design language. Hero's Xtreme 125R looks quite handsome in the flesh. At first glance, the Xtreme 125R looks quite radical. Take, for example, the front projector LED headlamps, indicators and that funky headlamp cowl design. Then there’s the tank extensions, alloy wheel design and that extended rear section just behind the grab handles, which looks rather sleek and sporty. I also like the stickers that read ‘125R’ and those cool tiny DRLs. Even subtle nuances like the reflector on the tyre hugger mud guard and well integrated saree guard really blend in well together. Hero has tried to make sure that the Xtreme 125R has a big bike feel, and I must say, it has succeeded. Thanks to all those busy design elements, there’s an undeniable heft to the 125R. There’s a certain confidence to the Xtreme 125R’s design language that is hard to miss, and that is a crucial factor when it has to appeal to a buyer that is looking for an all-rounder of sorts. 1. Xtreme badges on the tank look funky and fit well the overall edgy design of the 125R. 2. LED DRLs fit neatly above the headlamps and just below the number plate. 3. All the lighting on the Xtreme 125 is LED, which gives it a modern look. In terms of features, the biggest talking point has to be the single-channel ABS, which is a segment-first. In fact, that’s not the only segment topping feature here. The Xtreme 125R also boasts the widest rear tyre in its segment, which is a 120-section unit. To aid in the ride department, Hero has equipped the 125R with a Showa monoshock which does quite an excellent job, but, we’ll get to that part in a bit. Other than that, the entire lighting setup, front and back, is LED, which is a nice touch. The negative LCD instrument cluster is neat and clean, and displays all sorts of useful information like fuel efficiency on the go, trip meters and gear position indicator. However, I would’ve liked some connectivity features like the top-end model of the TVS Raider gets, but, that can be a more user-based preference, as well. Hero has equipped the Xtreme 125R quite well, and this should go a long way in appealing to its target audience. 1. Negative LCD screen is quite easy to read even during the day. 2. Hero’s done well to give the switchgear a feel of solidity and robustness. 3. 276mm disc has decent stopping power and single-channel ABS is a segment first. 4. Showa monoshock does a great job at handling bad roads and corners alike. 5. 120-section rear tyre is the widest in its segment and provides ample grip. 6. All-new 125cc engine feels like a smooth operator with a penchant for being revved hard. Hero MotoCorp has fitted the Xtreme 125R with an all-new engine. It’s a 124.7cc motor that churns out 11.4bhp and 10.5Nm of torque. Right from the get-go, this engine feels smooth, thanks to the silent cam chain and balancer shaft that Hero has added to make for a vibe-free experience. Although there are some vibes past the 7,000rpm mark, the acceleration on the whole feels progressive and there isn’t a lack of power. The mid-range is where the Xtreme 125R feels at its strongest. The five-speed gearbox operates without much hassle, although it has to be worked a lot if you want a quick overtake. For example, if you’re in third and want to quickly accelerate, I did end up working the gearbox to make that overtake. The claimed fuel efficiency figure stands at 66kmpl, which combined with the 10-litre fuel tank should give the Xtreme 125R a decent amount of range. Hero’s commuter with a sporty twist can easily hold speeds of 80 to 90kmph, and can go beyond as well, but, past 100kmph, it feels slightly out of its depth. One minor complaint would be the sound from the well-designed exhaust pipe. It does make noise, but it doesn’t sound unique or different from most other motorcycles out there. A slight bit of edge to the exhaust note would’ve only helped the Xtreme 125R’s case, in my opinion. I loved the fact that the Xtreme 125R is one of those bikes that can be ridden right at the edge, in the sense that all the performance is being used, and it’s a good feeling, to say the least. I loved revving the Xtreme 125R at every opportunity I got, but, at times, the gearbox didn’t quite keep up to the quick shifts. This isn’t a dealbreaker at all, but it can be felt in certain riding situations. Overall, the engine and gearbox combination is a good one, and output feels mature. The Xtreme 160R seating position has a slightly sporty setup but doesn't feel uncomfortable during long commutes. The Xtreme 125R is based on the same diamond-type frame as its elder sibling - 160R. As a result, it is an able handler and feels rather fun around corners and while carving through traffic. At 136kg, it is a little heavier than its main rival, which is the TVS Raider, but, there’s a sense of stability to the Xtreme 125R. It must be said that even the switchgear feels tactile and there’s a solidity to the overall finish of the motorcycle. The 276mm disc at the front and 130mm drum brake at the rear do a commendable job in bringing the 125R to a stop. The chassis feels very well sorted and provides a lovely balance between agile handling and ride comfort. When riding calmly through bad roads, the Xtreme 125R feels composed and not a lot of undulations come through to the rider. The Show rear monoshock must be praised for this, as well as the 37mm telescopic front fork, which does a more than decent job at making the Xtreme 125R a dual-natured motorcycle. The riding posture is also fairly neutral. The footpeg position is slightly rear-set, but the handlebar is relatively upright. All in all, the Xtreme 125R is a capable handler and comes with a respectable amount of ride comfort for daily use. Verdict The Xtreme 125R comes in two variants - IBS and ABS - which are priced at Rs 95,000 and 99,500, respectively (ex-showroom). It competes against the TVS Raider and Bajaj Pulsar NS125, mainly, given the fact that this is a commuter with a sporty and premium angle to it. In that respect, Hero has done a fabulous job with the Xtreme 125R. It delivers on being a comfortable, fun to ride, stylish and fuel-efficient commuter. So if you’re out looking for a 125cc motorcycle that is a good all-rounder, then the Xtreme 125R should be at the top of your list. Specifications : Engine - 124.7cc Power - 11.4bhp@8250rpm Torque - 10.5Nm@6500rpm Gearbox - 5-speed Wheelbase - 1319mm Kerb Weight - 136kg Fuel capacity - 10 litres Seat height - 794mm Price - Rs 95,000 onwards (ex-showroom)"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The compact SUV segment is a fiercely contested space. While models like the Maruti Suzuki Brezza and the Tata Nexon have been the traditional leaders, the Maruti Suzuki Fronx, Hyundai Venue and Kia Sonet are popular as well. The Mahindra XUV 3XO has also made a handsome start to its new innings. Now, Skoda Auto India is gearing up to enter the arena with a new model, which has not been officially named yet. The new Skoda compact SUV will be launched in India in the first half of 2025. It will be based on the same India-specific MQB-AO-IN platform that also underpins the Skoda Kushaq mid-size SUV and the Skoda Slavia mid-size sedan. The Kushaq and the Slavia are among the safest vehicles on sale in India. They have scored a five-star safety rating in both adult occupant protection category and child occupant protection category at Global NCAP. We expect the new Skoda compact SUV to be highly-rated on the safety aspect. Like its mid-size siblings, the compact model might get six airbags as standard. If we talk about features, the compact SUVs on sale in India right now are loaded to the gills. The Mahindra XUV 3XO even gets Level 2 ADAS. In such a scenario, we expect the new Skoda compact SUV to also offer contemporary features like LED headlamps and taillamps, alloy wheels, touchscreen infotainment, digital instrument panel and automatic climate control, among others. The new Skoda compact SUV will employ the 3-cylinder, 1.0-litre, TSI petrol engine, which is used by the Kushaq and the Slavia as well. This engine churns out 115PS of maximum power and 175Nm of peak torque. The transmission options include 6-speed MT and 6-speed AT torque converter. We expect the new Skoda compact SUV price to be in the range of Rs 8 lakh to Rs 15 lakh (ex-showroom). The vehicle will get the excise benefits for sub-4 metre cars on sale in India and the company will pass these benefits to customers when deciding the price. Skoda has set a volume target of 100,000 units in India by 2026. The new compact SUV is expected to greatly assist the company is achieving the target."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The market for CNG cars is rapidly growing in India. The industry-wide penetration for CNG cars increased to 15% in FY24. While original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like Tata Motors, Hyundai Motor India and Toyota Kirloskar Motor offer CNG models, Maruti Suzuki India is the one leading the CNG car segment with an aim to sell 600,000 units in FY25. According to Maruti, it sold 51,276 units of CNG cars in April 2024 and 46,774 units in May 2024. Maruti not only led the overall passenger vehicle (PV) market in FY24, but it was the top OEM selling CNG cars as well. During the fiscal, it sold 450,000 units of CNG cars. The company has the widest portfolio of CNG cars, including the Alto K10, WagonR, Baleno, Dzire, Ertiga and XL6. Its SUVs like the Fronx, Brezza and Grand Vitara also have a CNG option. For reference, the Maruti Suzuki Dzire CNG, Maruti Suzuki Brezza CNG and Maruti Suzuki Ertiga CNG are among the largest-selling CNG cars in India. At May 2024 sales call with select journalists, Maruti's Senior Executive Officer for Marketing and Sales, Partho Banerjee, said the Brezza CNG and the Ertiga CNG have a waiting period of four to six weeks. He observed that while the CNG contribution in the industry is now at 31.6%, it has gone up to 32.5% for Maruti. Banerjee said that every third car Maruti sells now is a CNG car.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story French marque Bugatti has taken a new step in its storied history with the reveal of the Tourbillion, which succeeds the Chiron in the brand's lineup of iconic hypercars. The Tourbillion heralds a new chapter in many aspects for Bugatti, including the powertrain, which for the first time since the Veyron doesn't use a W16 motor. Instead it uses a hybrid setup with an all-new V16 motor. Bugatti Tourbillon The name refers to the intricate spring technology used in high-end watches to keep their time-accuracy at the maximum. The price tag is an incredible GBP 3.2 million (Rs 34 crore, excluding excise and taxes). Only 250 units of the Tourbillion will be made, all of which have already been sold out. The new 8.3-litre V16 engine makes 1,000bhp and is paired to three e-motors, totalling 1,800bhp. Replacing an absolute juggernaut of an engine isn't easy when its a W16 quad-turbo setup capable of making 1,600bhp! So Bugatti took to hybridisation to replicate the performance of the W16. The Tourbillion uses a 8.3-litre naturally-aspirated V16 which is rev-happy and makes a thousand horses on its own! This is paired to three electric motors sourced from Rimac, two of which sit at the front and one at the rear, which provide an extra 800bhp, totalling 1,800bhp being sent to all the wheels. This makes it the most powerful combustion engined car on sale today, with every other car making more power being electric. The Tourbillon has a new platform, developed with 3D printed parts and the capacity to use hybrid powertrains. The 25kWh battery pack can aid the Tourbillon to move on e-power alone for 60km. All of this means that the Tourbillon can accelerate from 0 to 100kmph in two seconds, 0 to 200kmph in under five seconds and 0 to 300kmph in under 10 seconds. The top speed has been quoted as 445kmph, which is higher than the one the Chiron could achieve withouts its 'special' key. However, the brand says that this is not the maximum speed the Tourbillion is capable of, considering that the Chiron did go above the 480kmph barrier, with less power at its disposal. The Tourbillon continues with the family design theme, but is quite different to its predecessors. The Tourbillon is perhaps one of the most exquisite looking cars of all times, and continues on the C-Line principle like the Veyron and Chiron. It also gets the horseshoe grille and the central spine dividing the car into two equal halves. Every single surface, inlet and ridge on the Tourbillon has been honed to perfection, not only to make it aerodynamic but also cool the massive engine. Bugatti Tourbillon rear The rear wing remains submerged even at top speed, without any effect on its functions while the massive diffuser at the rear actually starts where the cabin ends, and to the end of the bodywork. Effectively, the active spoiler can be up or down at all speeds, without much change in the aero effect it has on the car. The Tourbillon gets dihedral doors, allowing easy access into the cabin. The car weighs in at 1,995kg, less than the Chiron despite the hybrid powertrain. This is courtesy of a bespoke carbon shell, derived from motorsport. The Tourbillon interior is made from exquisite materials. The inside of the Tourbillon is a work of art, and not just because of the expensive materials used in the trims but the mechanisms. Unlike modern cars, there is a heavy reliance on physical buttons and mechanical tech. The highlight of the cabin is the instrumentation, which is a mechanical marvel - designed by Swiss watchmakers. It has 600 components and uses titanium, sapphire and ruby. The steering is mounted on a fixed hub, meaning that the gauge cluster never moves. There is a small screen, which folds down into the dashboard whenever not needed. The steering is mounted on the hub, which means that the analogue dials stay fixed in their place while the steering turns. The Tourbillon has set new benchmarks in the world of luxury performance, and goes up against mainly the Koenigsegg Jesko and the Pagani Utopia if exclusivity, jaw-dropping price, mind-numbing performance, intricate design and materials are the defining factors. Bugatti's super-sport cars in one frame - (L-R) EB110, Veyron, Chiron and the Tourbillon."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Under fire from his critics, both in India and Pakistan, after the BJP government named him for a Padma Shri, Adnan Sami has offered his soothing music to calm the anger down. Amid the raging controversy over the Indian civilian honour for the son of a Pakistani air-force pilot, the 48-year-old artiste, however, appreciated the contentious CAA as a \"quick solution\" to what otherwise was a long-drawn process for persecuted minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan to secure Indian citizenship. In his interview to India Today TV, the musician-singer also mounted a veiled attack on the liberals, who he found have not defended him against harsh critiques for being named a Padma Shri recipient. \"I got it in the field of art. Where are those voices today who chant the phrase that art has no boundaries?\" Sami wondered. \"The same people criticising me right now will have drinks and listen to my music while relaxing,\" he joked. Sami said his Padma Shri has lifted him to \"the top of the world\". He feels the plea his popular song \"Lift Karadey\" carries has been heard. \"Teri Oonchi Shaan Hai Maula... Mujhko Bhi To Lift Kara De,\" he sang, summarising one part of his mood. But Sami is also sad. This because his critics have been targeting him for his father's military background in Pakistan. \"My father was a decorated war hero from Pakistan in the 1965 war. He was a patriotic soldier, who fought in the line of duty. I am very proud of the principles he held,\" Sami said. The singer, now an Indian citizen, insisted that he is as committed to India as his father was to Pakistan. \"He was very patriotic towards his country. I am patriotic to my country (India). It's sad to see my father being brought in.\" Sami rejected accusations that his praise of the Modi government helped him secure a Padma award.\"I am not a politician. I am a musician. Why wouldn't I appreciate if anyone does anything good?\" he asked. To his detractors, Sami chanted \"Hum Bhi To Hain Tumhaare Deewane Ho Deewane\" from his \"Kabhi To Nazar Milao\" song. But the singer described the CAA as a move in the right direction so far as persecuted minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are concerned. \"They have just given a facility to minorities coming from theocratic countries and given a process with which they can fast-track the citizenship,\" he said. \"The (Indian citizenship) process for the Muslims is there for 50 years through which I got my citizenship. That process exists even today. The point is that those particular minorities get faster citizenship. If somebody requires quick assistance, this (the CAA) is a quick solution.\" Asked if he had any message for the Shaheen Bagh protestors, Sami cautioned that no one should allow oneself to be \"misguided\" into \"messing up\" with India's rich legacy. \"I have lived in different parts of the world. What we have here in India is not there in any other part of the world,\" he said. \"We have a rich civilization, a rich culture and amazing values. Don't destroy it. Don't mess with it. ...Don't allow any force from anywhere to stir up your emotions to misguide you.\" About his Pakistani critics calling him a \"sellout\" for taking Indian citizenship, he said the description best suited Muhammad Ali Jinnah. \"Jinnah is the first person to be called a sell-out because he sold out India.\""

His immediate need is to secure some transactional benefits,\" remarked Tarun Khanna, the HBS' Jorge Paulo Lemann professor. \"This obviously is connectivity to the Indian American population, which is increasingly very important in this country when you look at how the electoral system works this year.\" Ashutosh Varshney, a Sol Goldman professor of international studies and social sciences at the Brown University, agreed. \"Yes, it's becoming increasingly clear to the scholars, watchers and observers of American politics that even though the Indian American community in the aggregate is small -- it's one per cent -- it's very important in some states,\" he said. Varshney identified Texas, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania where Indian-American voters could impact Trump's fortunes in the US elections. Texas, the second-largest state of America, has 38 seats in the US electoral college, he explained. \"It's no longer a solid Republican state. There are about 400,000 Indians in Texas, of which 300,000 are likely to vote. And that can actually swing Texas' potential.\" According to Varshney, Trump's victory margins in Pennsylvania, Florida and Michigan were one per cent or less or slightly more than one per cent in the last election. \"So Indian Americans in these four states especially can make a difference.\" TRUMP ON \"VANITY\" FLIGHT Trump's India visit appeals to his \"vanity\", says Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at the MIT. \"I think at a higher level for President Trump, this is a vanity exercise. I think he loves the idea of being adulated in the crowds,\" Narang said. \"There is this effort to try and swing Indian Americans, who have been historically very, very liberal and democratic, and pull them to the Republicans. At a very basic level, this is an opportunity for him to be loved by the Indian crowds.\" SENTIMENT BOOSTER A leading fund manager tracking Indian and American markets, Punita Kumar-Sinha says the US President's visit to Ahmedabad, Agra and Delhi could help encourage international business sentiments about India as anti-CAA protests and economic slowdown grip the South Asian nation. \"President Trump's visit to India is more favourable for the Indian counterparts than perhaps for the Americans,\" she said. \"I think in India, right now, we really need some sentiment boosters.\" With foreign capital inflows not being aggressive, Trump's visit sends out a positive message about the investment climate in India, she insisted. \"To the extent President Trump is in India, it validates that America is looking at India as a serious partner on many fronts, including investment. So foreign investors, particularly in the US, who have been a little concerned about the CAA and economic growth, are going to look at this as a sign of some positive movement and that things are not that bad,\" said Punita Kumar-Sinha, Managing Partner at the Pacific Paradigm Advisors. With no major trade deal expected during the trip, Punita Kumar-Sinha is, however, optimistic that it does promise \"one step in the direction for next trade negotiations.\" India, she said, also stands a chance to grab the economic space that China risks losing because of the coronavirus outbreak. \"I think it is even more important for India right now to be seen as an alternative source to China. This coronavirus has just raised the risk of doing business with one country.\" COMPETITIVE PROTECTIONISM But Khanna and Narang believe protectionism on both sides has been holding up trade negotiations. \"In general, both countries are far too protectionist,\" said Khanna. It is in the interest of both countries to use these few good symbolic visits to whittle away at trade barriers.\" Compromise holds the key to trade negotiations, Narang remarked. \"But the points of friction (between India and the US) are real. I think there's a little bit of disappointment that both sides have held so firmly on what seems like tactical issues on trade rather than move the ball forward on the broader relationship. The fact that both sides have dug their heels on the protectionist ground is a little disappointing.\" Observers of American politics also expressed apprehensions that the Modi government's ties with the Trump administration are being increasingly perceived as partisan. WHAT IF TRUMP LOSES POWER With Sen. Bernie Sanders gaining steam as the Democratic front-runner, a change in guard at Washington DC in this year's US election might affect India-US ties adversely, experts fear. \"There's a concern among the Democrats, for example, that the BJP has gone all-in with Trump, virtually endorsing him at 'Howdy, Modi!' in Houston and dismissing the Democrats -- not meeting with the Democrats when the government of India officials come to Washington DC,\" Narang said. \"So there is this risk. Looks like Bernie Sanders is gaining momentum,\" he added. Varshney echoed similar views and cautioned that a Democrat victory might bump up issues surrounding revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status and the CAA to the centre of America's India policy. \"It is generally true that when the Democrats come to power, human-rights issues become much more important in diplomatic negotiations and public commentary. There is no doubt about that,\" he said. \"If Bernie Sanders were to win -- there's no way one can predict it at this point -- Kashmir and the CAA will become very important in India-US relations.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The man at the center of India's coronavirus war wouldn't hazard a guess on the 21-day lockdown -- whether it should be extended or not. But what Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, the chief scientist at the Indian Council of Medical Research, is sure of is that there's absolutely no room for complacency in social-distancing measures at this stage. \"I think it's premature to say whether the lockdown has to be continued or not continued,\" he told India Today in an exclusive interview. Dr Gangakhedkar referred to the Nizamuddin Markaz episode that shot off several clusters of Covid-19 across the country. \"Perhaps we'll see more number of cases occurring in the present period. We need to wait for some time,\" he remarked. The call on the lockdown, he continued, should be taken closer to April 14. BCG VACCINE NO PROTECTION Asked about studies suggesting that anti-TB shots, common in India, may provide protection against Covid-19, the ICMR's chief scientist cautioned that the immunity the drug induces against tuberculosis doesn't last forever in the first place. \"One thing is to be remembered that if I am providing BCG vaccination at birth, one may not expect that the immunity will last for the lifetime itself,\" Dr Gangakhedkar said. \"When you do a TB test, you find the small fraction of the population coming out TB positive. That means the TB-specific immunity wears off gradually.\" People, he advised, should not be complacent over reports linking BCG vaccines to Covid-19 protection. WEATHER THEORIES INCONCLUSIVE Dr Gangakhedkar also described theories that summer may weaken transmissions as speculative, saying several countries with hot and humid conditions were continuing to report coronavirus cases. \"We have yet to see the impact of summer on it. I need to have some evidence for the same,\" the ICMR's chief scientist said as he underscored the need for people to comply with social-distancing and lockdown guidelines strictly. INDIA FULLY PREPARED Dr Gangakhedkar would not prefer to classify the incidence of Covid-19 into stages but maintained that the country is fully prepared for all scenarios. \"Even if we get to let's stay stage three, my interventions are not going to be different,\" he said. For Dr Gangakhedkar, the key lies in knowing the sources of infection. He also assured the country's medical fraternity that all efforts were underway to procure personal protection equipment for the frontline medical staff. \"Effort wise, we are doing our best.\" He, however, expressed concerns over asymptomatic infections. \"The percentage of people with asymptomatic infections could be higher. That's why we are saying physical distancing is important,\" Dr Gangakhedkar said."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A globally-renowned strategic and international security expert, Ashley J Tellis fears that the Ladakh faceoff between India and China could well escalate into an armed conflict between the two Asian giants. \"What is very clear to me is that what is happening on the borders with India in all the different areas is certainly not some localised action, which has been provoked simply by zealous local commanders,\" he told India Today in an exclusive interview. \"It is a set of actions that has been approved at the theatre level and if it has been approved at the theatre level, then it almost inevitably has been approved at the level of the general staff in Beijing as well.\" Tellis, who helped the then Bush administration craft the landmark nuclear deal with India, believes New Delhi should stay prepared militarily for a possible conflict with Beijing while both engage in diplomatic dialogue. \"India continues to be in dialogue with China itself -- I think that's clearly the first line of effort that has to be employed,\" he remarked. \"Second, India has to continue to make prudent military preparations, including anticipating escalation, and compel the Chinese to consider what the cost of that escalation might be for China's own reputation and for China's own interests, especially given that these are marginal territories nothing that fundamentally goes to China's core interests.\" He described China's troop movements in the Ladakh region as a clear attempt to change the status quo to its advantage. \"I think what the Chinese are trying to do is to establish new facts on the ground,\" said Tellis. \"By pushing troops and materials to the limits of the claimed lines, they want to change the status quo in ways that will advantage them.\" The international defence-policy analyst underscored that Beijing's aggressive moves are motivated by mounting global pressure for its handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak. \"They are doing (this) at a time when they are under pressure because of their performance in the Covid-19 crisis. This is another way of showing that China will not be cowed by the international display over their performance of the management of the pandemic,\" Tellis said. US STANDS BESIDE INDIA Tellis maintained that Washington will stand beside New Delhi because the United States regards China's muscle-flexing \"unwarranted and unjustified\". \"There's no way that India will back down nor should it because if it does then it is going to be open sesame for all kinds of tests of resolve and not just along the borders,\" he cautioned. \"And on the issues where the disputation is currently taking place, which is in Eastern Ladakh, Indian claims are actually resolute and the US will stand behind it.\" India, he added, has no choice but to \"play the game to its conclusion\" and \"to try and do it in ways that do not end up in open conflict\". TRUMP'S MEDIATION OFFER \"IMPULSIVE\" Tellis, however, insisted that President Donald Trump's offer of mediation between India and China wouldn't really work. \"It's very hard to explain anything why Donald Trump does what he does. But he has constantly been tempted by the prospect of being the peacemaker,\" he said. \"I would not take it (the mediation offer) seriously. I think it is one more impulsive response on the part of the president. He means well but I think he is smart enough to recognise that this is an offer that is not going to go anywhere.\" Tellis agreed that dialogue between New Delhi and Beijing would help the two countries resolve their issues. \"But what has to be conveyed very clearly is that China cannot be allowed to unilaterally change the realities on the ground simple because it has the first-mover advantage in terms of shifting men and material in disputed territories.\" \"TIT-FOR-TAT AN OPTION\" Asked about the range of options New Delhi can exercise with Beijing, Tellis listed a \"tit-for-tat\" response in the Ladakh region as one of them. \"India could simply acquiesce to the new status quo, which would be unfortunate if it did because it would only entice the Chinese to push even more,\" he cautioned. \"India could engage in a physical eviction of the Chinese forces but that would almost certainly lead to a military skirmish, which could have some potential for escalation into major conventional options. So that's not a very attractive prospect as well. But the third and the most interesting possibility is that India can play tit-for-tat. There are various salients along the LAC where India has the tactical advantage and the capacity to occupy territories. So India could respond by essentially doing what the Chinese have done.\" The Chinese, he argued, need to understand that their \"unprovoked action\" is \"deeply destabilising\". \"It ultimately undermines the larger objective of keeping India away from the US. I mean actions like this will only force a deeper US-Indian collaboration, which precisely what a smart leadership in Beijing hoping to avoid,\" Tellis explained. The strategic analyst called the situation \"grave\" and wondered why the Chinese chose the time they did for mobilisation in the Ladakh region. \"At this juncture and time, why does an effort to lay claim to territories that really both sides have lived with the ambiguities for so long? Why does it make a difference? Why is China prepared to sacrifice the modest gains it has made in terms of building a workman-like relationship with India for really marginal territories?\" Tellis asked. China, he explained, thinks \"it can get away with it\" Tellis praised India's diplomatic engagements and military movements in response to China's buildup. CHINA AND THE COST OF ESCALATION But the Chinese, he said, would retreat only when they realised the cost of a potential escalation. \"I think what will certainly happen is both sides will attempt to engage in a diplomatic dialogue to try and restore the status quo ante. But the real question is: Will the Chinese having made this investment so far walk back? I think the only way they walk back is when they realise that the costs of a serious conflict are really more than what they would want to bear,\" Tellis said. He suggested New Delhi also bring the diplomatic community, including Beijing's friendly nations, and their influence to bear on the Chinese."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A resolution of the Tibetan issue is the way to peace on the India-China border, says Prime Minister of Tibetan government-in-exile Dr Lobsang Sangay in an exclusive interview with India Today TV. Responding to a question on the call for boycott of Chinese goods, Sangay suggested that celebrities should stop endorsing them, for a start. India-China standoff On the latest face-off between India and China, Sangay said: \"We have been saying for the last 60 years what happened to Tibet could happen to you to India and all the neighbouring countries of Tibet. Since the occupation of Tibet, China has been trying to expand its influence to the South Asian region as well. Till you resolve this issue of Tibet, border incursions and tensions will remain.\" Asked about the recent aggression and increasing adventurism by Beijing, the PM of Tibetan government-in-exile said, \"The recent adventurism is part of an expansionist design. Politically, whenever you [China] have some internal tension or problems, you want the distraction of external problems. You can see from South China Sea to Hong Kong to Taiwan and the 3,488-km border between Tibet and India. After Tibet was occupied, the Chinese leaders, including Mao Tse Tung, have said Tibet is the palm and the five fingers are Ladakh, Sikkim, Nepal, Bhutan and Arunachal\". \"They have taken over the palm and now they are taking over and penetrating into the five fingers. This is what's happening in Ladakh as well. This is part of their grand old strategy for 60 long years. They are coming under enormous international pressure, given the Wuhan-originated pandemic. Most countries are blaming them, as well as the WHO [World Health Organisation], on the origin of coronavirus from the Chinese city of Wuhan,\" he added. China's pressure problem Outlining a picture on dynamics between mainland China and Tibet and the kind of pressure Beijing faces, Dr Sangay said, \"When you don't come through a democratic process, there is an element of insecurity and paranoia. The latest is in Tibet; no-one is allowed to visit Tibetan monasteries. Nuns and monks need local permission even to venture outside their monasteries and state-level permission for travel. Beijing wants absolute control over the Tibetan plateau. The Chinese leadership is in a bit of a jittery mood and hence clamping down on the Tibetan people. This is the holiest month for Tibetans. A few days ago, it was Buddha Purnima. This is the month when monks are allowed to travel, but the Chinese government is applying so much pressure. The broken promises On the military build-up along the India-Tibet border, Dr Sangay said: \"When the Chinese government promised to build a road connecting China and Tibet, they promised prosperity and stability. But the road was used to bring trucks, guns and tanks to occupy Tibet. Since that time one road has become 100 roads all over the Tibetan plateau, including the border with India\". \"They have built 30 airports, including six military airfields, in neighbouring Arunachal, Ladakh and various places in Tibet. Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) have been stationed in and around the plateau. All this military build-up has been taking place for 60 years. Even the railway line to Lhasa and coming to the border of Nepal is of high military-grade which can bring heavy equipment,\" he added. He further said, \"The entire Tibetan plateau has been militarised. What the Dalai Lama has been saying the permanent solution to this border tension is to make Tibet a zone of peace and demilitarise the borders. History tells us there was not even the need for police to guard the border of India and Tibet. Since it became the India-China border, all these tensions have come up.\" Asked about a realistic political resolution of the Tibet issue, Sangay said, \"A colonial power always uses some economic justification to occupy a country... similarly, they are using this economic justification in Tibet as well. But it is baseless. If the Chinese government is so confident that people in Tibet will support them, then, let's have a referendum. I can say with certainty, a Tibetan leader will win hands down. It's a fact that 154 Tibetans have committed self-immolation. They are suffering; their repression is so painful. This is what's going on in Tibet.\" Bill to recognise Tibet A US lawmaker has moved a bill in the Congress asking for the American president to recognise Tibet as an independent nation. What do you make of it? \"We welcome any kind of support from anybody. But this is more of a symbolic gesture, however, there is a more substantive bill called the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2019 which was supported by 95 per cent of the Congress. It shows that support for Tibet in the US and even Europe and many Western countries is very strong. Unless you know the issue of Tibet, you will never fully understand China. This is a lesson for India and for its people to know what China is capable of,\" said the PM of Tibetan government-in-exile. Lesson for India What lesson India need to learn in the manner China manoeuvred into Tibet? Sangay explained: \"There is a famous document called Simla Convention which was signed in 1914. The India-Pakistan Simla Pact is very well known but Simla Convention between India and Tibet is not as well known. Since 1914, the convention was renewed between Lhasa and Delhi but in 1954, it was renewed between Beijing and India and it came out in the form of Panchsheel. If you look at the agreement, Panchsheel is mentioned only in the Preamble, but the trade route is still from Sikkim to Lhasa. Since Panchsheel, India had to withdraw its representatives as well as a small police-military contingent from Lhasa. Since Panchsheel was signed, disappointment after disappointment came for India, including the 1962 war. India needs to learn a lesson. Trusting the Chinese government fully is not the way to go. You must have a business relationship with China, that's a fact. But your business should yield you much more.\" Boycott of Chinese products On the call to boycott Chinese goods, Sangay said if tension is very high, it is for the individual Indian citizen to decide whether your national security is important or buying Chinese products. \"You can start with celebrities not endorsing Chinese products.\" \"You can control any kind of business from any country. People also have a role to play. Celebrities, when they endorse any brand, including Chinese brand, are doing it for money. You can start from there. When you are doing business with China, you must make money from it. The trade deficit is disproportionately against India. That's not the way to go,\" he added. The Dalai Lama succession Asked about the Dalai Lama's view on the standoff, Sangay said, \"In 2011, His Holiness the Dalai Lama renounced political responsibilities and handed over to a democratically elected leader that happens to be me. I speak on his behalf and for all the Tibetan people.\" On being the political successor of Dalai Lama as China may prop up some candidate as the leader of Tibet, he said, \"It's my office that will shoulder the political responsibilities of the Tibetan movement and administration. As far as Beijing is concerned, they already have Tibetan officials in symbolic positions of what they call the Tibet Autonomous Region. More importantly, they don't have power. They don't reflect the aspirations and representation of Tibetans.\" Suggestions for India What are your recommendations to the Indian establishment? \"Till the issue of Tibet is not resolved, border incursions will continue. These kinds of issues will keep coming whenever there is internal or international pressure on the Chinese government. Till the border changes from Indo-China back to Indo-Tibet, it will continue. For the security of India, Tibet is very important,\" the PM of Tibetan government-in-exile said."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The latest border stand-off between India and China seems to have eased for now but Ladakh BJP MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal asserts that not one inch of land has been lost to China since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014. In an exclusive interview to India Today TV, Namgyal advocated the need for India to ramp up infrastructure development in border areas as it is the only way to strengthen security. He added that the border population does not want confrontation with any neighbouring country, but will rise to the occasion if needed. On Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's allegations about the government keeping silent on the issue, Namgyal said, \"What can I say about a leader who tears up an ordinance promulgated by his own government? It is a political issue for him to spread fear-mongering. I only wish that Rahul Gandhi would make an effort of understanding the border issue here. I have engaged with him on Twitter where I provided a list of China's territory grabs during the UPA years.\" \"I have visited all these areas and have photographic proof. Ever since the Narendra Modi government came to power in 2014, not one inch of land has been lost to China,\" BJP MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal said. Infrastructure development on border areas The Ladakh BJP MP said if India wants to strengthen its border, the government has to focus on infrastructure development. \"Till the time the civilian population is not encouraged, our border security can't be strengthened,\" he added. Jamyang Tsering Namgyal also responded to a question about China's mindset behind the aggression on the border at a time when it is under attack from all quarters over the pandemic. He said, \"The forward policy envisioned by Nehru ji (Jawaharlal Nehru) for India is only a paper policy right now. We (India) kept moving back one step at a time and China capitalised on that and kept moving forward.\" \"The policymakers sitting in Delhi will have to understand one thing. All the resident civilians living in villages in border areas have to be encouraged to settle permanently by creating strong infrastructure like electricity, mobile network, schools,\" the Ladakh BJP MP added. Namgyal further stated, \"This will help us create a landmark and permanent villages. Though we have villages now, they are discouraged to live permanently as they do not have medical facilities nor educational institutes or telecommunication.\" In the 21st century when the world is moving on to 4G and 5G, Namgyal said: \"Why should educated youngsters living in Ladakh live there without any facilities?\" Chinese occupation of pasture lands On the Chinese army's occupation of pasture lands, the BJP MP said, \"Yes, this has been happening over the decades since the 1962 war when China occupied 37,244 sq km of Aksai Chin, what I call China-occupied Ladakh. The PLA under the shadow of Chinese nomads has occupied the pasture lands inch by inch in these years. This has been China's policy.\" \"The incursions are not just taking place at Pangong Tso Lake and Chushul but in several other areas as well. Our nomads live in every area. Their summer and winter pasture lands are different. In winter, the nomads descend. They move according to the climate. We have lost several pasture lands as our people cannot move now,\" Jamyang Tsering Namgyal said. Reclaiming Aksai Chin There is a perception building up in Chinese media that since India carved out Ladakh as a separate Union Territory, China has seen the decision as a provocation. If one is to believe this perception, the key reason for the current border tension is because India turned Ladakh into a separate UT and Home Minister Amit Shah said Aksai Chin belongs to India. Responding to this, Namgyal said, \"Amit Shah ji said it right. I want to add that Aksai Chin is not just ours but the CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) that passes through the Shaksgam Valley, which Pakistan gave to China, also belongs to India. We should reclaim all.\" When asked if it would be possible to reclaim the areas after such a long gap, Namgyal said, \"It may be difficult but not impossible.\" The BJP MP from Ladakh also said that China should have no objection to infrastructure development in Ladakh, like the construction of the Daulat Beg Oldi road because it is in India's territory. Morale of local population \"It is normal for the border population because they have been witnessing it for the last so many years. People are ready to stand with the nation. The morale of the civilian population is high. But they have clearly said they don't want to go to war at present. Any confrontation impacts developmental activities and their lives. They don't want confrontation with any neighbouring country. To boost the morale of border residents, we should give them infrastructure,\" claimed Jamyang Tsering Namgyal. \"Demchok always remains in the news. The original Demchok is with India. Close to this, China built a new Demchok village on their side which didn't even exist earlier. They have built 13 structures and developed roads and telecom facilities and other infrastructure. They permanently settled the nomads from nearby areas there, giving them all facilities. We should understand that in order to strengthen the border, China is permanently establishing its people. We could not even open a primary school, provide telecom or any other facility to the villages we had,\" Namgyal said in response to a question about moving people of Ladakh to remote villages that can then be rebuilt. He went further to add, \"We don't need to shift the people from towns to the border areas. The original border residents should get all facilities and be permanently settled.\" Benefits of becoming Union Territory BJP MP from Ladakh Jamyang Tsering Namgyal took the opportunity to provide clarity on the expectations of the people of Ladakh since it became a Union Territory. He said, \"Several developmental works have picked up pace since Ladakh became a UT -- whether it is government schemes, education or health facilities. There is a need to increase manpower at the executive agencies. It is then we will be able to speed up our infrastructure work.\" In response to a question about the Tibet issue, Namgyal said, \"Looking at the geopolitical dimension, Tibet could provide a solution to India-China problem.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story India will soon be the global epicentre of Covid-19, worries globally renowned public health expert Dr Ashish K Jha. It’s time to go aggressively after the virus, the Harvard Global Health Institute director told India Today TV in an interaction. Saying that limiting testing is a self-defeating strategy, Dr Jha said India could be growing at 30 to 50,000 cases every day, but only a small part of that is being captured right now. Is India the next global hotspot? “That's the worry,” said Dr Jha. “It is becoming the global hotspot. And we are still early in this pandemic with many, many months to go before there is a vaccine. Probably about a year to go before there's a vaccine. The question in front of us is what is India's strategy for slowing down the spread of the virus? And there are only three things we know that can make any difference. One is social distancing; lockdown is the most extreme version of that. Second is testing, tracing and isolation. And the third is wearing mask. It is very important that people start doing it in an aggressive way. We have been talking about testing since the beginning of this and India has made some good progress. It is far from where it needs to be on testing. I think we all want to figure out how we avoid lockdowns over and over again for the next year.” Late last month, in an interaction with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, professor Jha stressed upon the need for an aggressive testing strategy in high-risk areas. The conversation was part of Rahul Gandhi’s ongoing series of dialogues with globally recognised experts on tackling the pandemic. What are you making from the big picture emerging from India? “I am worried not because of all the cases India has. On a per capita basis, India still has a few cases and a few deaths. But the trajectory, the path, the constant day-to-day increases are very concerning to me. 10,000-12,000 people are getting identified; that's much more than where India was even just a couple of weeks ago. And then I think what's going to break this exponential curve? I am worried that the lockdown has already been done. Outside of the lockdown, there are only a couple of other things we know about stopping and slowing down the spread of the virus. I am worried if India is going to be able to do all that.” Asked why the testing numbers are coming down and why trying to find some way of artificially deflating testing data is hugely problematic, Prof Jha explained, “The whole purpose of the lockdown, which I supported, was to buy time. You are buying time to build up a very extensive testing and tracing programme. And I am worried that India had a very long and costly lockdown but didn't use that time adequately to build up a testing infrastructure. And now the cases are surging. This is where the testing should be surging. We should be substantially increasing the number of tests across the country. I am worried there are hotspots that we are missing because we are not even testing in those places. And we are missing a large number of cases.” On the politics behind some states reducing testing in order to keep infection numbers low, the health expert said, “It is a very self-defeating strategy. It's a very short-term strategy...We are seeing same issue play out in Brazil and our own President Trump tried to downplay testing for the same mindset. Here's the bottomline -- testing doesn't cause the cases, the virus cause the cases. You can put blindfolds on for some time but at some point, it will become overwhelming. Looking at the Indian subcontinent, I am very worried that we continue to miss a large number of cases. The best models right now suggest that every day maybe 30,000-50,000 Indians are getting infected but we are only capturing 10,000-12,000. This is not any way to curtail and control the pandemic. We have to be much more aggressive on testing.” Asked if he thought that India will soon overtake America in the number of cases, Jha said that's the worry. \"India has to go after the virus very aggressively and not be reactive.” Do you believe the Indian government’s assertion that we are not in the community transmission stage, Dr Jha said, “Of course, India is in community transmission. Why there is any question about this. This is a distraction and we need to focus on how we curtail the virus.”"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Sources high in the Government of India said that the Chinese Army had agreed to disengage during the military meeting on June 6 but instead of pulling back, the local Chinese military commander crossed the Line of Actual Control (LAC). This is what led to the violent face-off between Indian troops and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) on the night of June 15. Adding to what transpired at the LAC in eastern Ladakh's Galwan Valley, sources told India Today TV that the Commanding Officer from the Indian side went to urge Chinese troops to adhere to the disengagement plan. This is when the situation spiraled out of control resulting in violence that has claimed the lives of 20 Indian soldiers and 40 casualties on the Chinese side. Sources in the top levels of government said that the message to the rest of the world is simple, that India will talk to China directly. \"China is trying to exercise military and diplomatic muscles globally post the pandemic but the difference is that India will fight back,\" sources said adding that China is behaving violently and unreasonably in plain sight. Officials in the Centre maintain that India was implementing the June 6 deal and everything was going as agreed until Monday night. Indian intelligence agencies are carefully examining audio intercepts, visuals, and survivor reports to assess the casualties on the Chinese side. Preliminary reports suggest that PLA might have lost more than 40 personnel. However, India does not expect China to own up to the number of casualties owing to its track record of concealing deaths."

With schools shut and homeschooling becoming a trend, children find themselves spending more time indoors and in front of the screens. And even as countries world over have started inoculating their citizens against the coronavirus, global biotech companies like Moderna doesn’t expect to have clinical trial data on its Covid-19 vaccine in young children until 2022. However, Dr Krishna Ella, Chief Managing Director of Bharat Biotech -- the firm which has developed one of India’s indigenous coronavirus vaccine -- in an exclusive interview with India Today TV's News Director Rahul Kanwal said Covaxin can be given to children aged between 2 and 12. “Our inactivated vaccine [Covaxin] will be ideal to give to children aged between 2 and 12. We want to put up a proposal to DCGI and subject expert committees. Probably in another 10 days, we will be able to hold small clinical trials because this vaccine can go to children without any issues,” Dr Ella told India Today TV. Bharat Biotech has been in the eye of the storm after the Centre granted emergency use permission to its vaccine Covaxin. Following the formal approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), questions were raised on the emergency use permission without Covaxin ’s Phase 3 trials. Dr Ella has slammed the criticism against the indigenous vaccine and its emergency approval . The Bharat Biotech head hit back at critics and said the approvals have been granted on the basis of conditions set up by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) 2019. “My grandson is six-years-old and I don’t mind administrating the vaccine to him. Yes, we don’t have data yet. But Phase 3 trials data will be available in another four months,” Dr Ella told India Today TV. CMD of Bharat Biotech Dr. Krishna Ella gives an update on Bharat Biotech's Nasal vaccine. He also tells if the #Covaxin vaccine can be given to kids. #Newstrack pic.twitter.com/aNjtsQdbKu — Rahul Kanwal (@rahulkanwal) January 13, 2021 Covaxin has been approved for administration on children above the age of 12 years . Bharat Biotech's anti-coronavirus vaccine, which is being developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) and NIV (National Institute of Virology), was the first vaccine to be tested on children in September last year. While Bharat Biotech is presently conducting Phase 3 clinical trials with 26,000 volunteers, so far, the government has said the Covid-19 vaccination drive is intended only for adults. But this approval gives hope that it can be extended entirely to children in the future if there is sufficient and satisfactory data available.

Speaking exclusively with India Today TV, General Bipin Rawat said while there are constraints in handling the coronavirus crisis, \"such synergy between the three armed forces has never been seen before\". India is struggling with the second wave of coronavirus infection as hospitals in several states are reeling under a shortage of oxygen and beds. As Covid cases spiked in India, overwhelming the hospitals across several states and causing oxygen shortages, which resulted in many deaths, the Indian Air Force was roped in for the international operations. The three services as well as other wings of the defence ministry have been extending support to various state governments and union territories in dealing with a massive spike in coronavirus cases. Speaking about how the armed forces are being mobilised to ensure the transportation of oxygen to areas lacking oxygen manufacturing capabilities, General Bipin Rawat said, \"Unfortunately, the armed forces do not have the capacity to generate oxygen. We do not have oxygen plants; even for our own hospitals, we bank on agencies to provide us with oxygen.\" Also Read | Armed forces battle second wave of Covid-19: Mission oxygen, hospitals on war-footing \"To transport oxygen in rural and other areas of the country, we are buying oxygen concentrators.

We are expecting about 5,000 concentrators being made available to us...these will be deployed in areas where we find a lack of oxygen.\" Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat: “Armed forces resources being deployed to move oxygen cylinders”.

He also said the armed forces have created new hospital infrastructures, new resources, and have installed vital items to serve the needy as the country fights the devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. General Bipin Rawat also said such synergy between the three armed services to serve the nation has never been seen before. \"The kind of positivity that is being generated...we are walking the extra mile to ensure that we move forward and work together.

In the times of Covid, we have carried out 'what can happen?'. We have made sure we have a minimal presence on the borders to prevent being surprised. We are maintaining reserve forces in-depth areas to ensure that should something go wrong, we are able to position troops at the place of our choosing.\" As India fights the #CovidSecondWave , is there a concern that China might create mischief along the Himalayan ranges?

Earlier, Gen Bipin Rawat had called upon the armed forces to rise to the occasion and support the civil administrations across the country in dealing with the pandemic as well as creating mitigation facilities in a time-bound manner. \"Our men and women in uniform have the will and dedication to break barriers and walk the extra mile, always and every time,\" Gen Rawat said.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Top government sources told India Today that there have been no killings in violence-hit Manipur since July 18, and that normalcy will soon be restored through peace talks that are underway with the Meiteis and Kukis. In a rebuttal to the opposition's criticism of the Centre's inaction over the issue, the sources pointed out that Home Minister Amit Shah had spent three days in Manipur, where he met with 41 different groups and visited major sites of violence. They also emphasised PM Modi’s hands-on approach. “PM has been personally monitoring every development in Manipur and has been receiving constant updates on the situation. On days, PM has been briefed up to thrice in a day on the situation in Manipur,” the sources said. The opposition's claim that Manipur is burning is a \"false narrative,\" according to the government sources. They asserted that the graph of violence has steadily decreased and challenged the notion that the state is still in turmoil. “After July, 18 there has been no death in an incidence of violence in Manipur,” they said. The home ministry is actively working to bridge the distrust between the two communities by engaging in separate talks with their respective representatives. Six rounds of talks have already been held with each side. “The top priority is to get both communities on the negotiation table. Opinion on reconciliation among both communities is divided but the government is hopeful that there will be a breakthrough in talks soon,” the source added. To ensure the safety and security of the affected population, the government has deployed over 35,000 security personnel. This has allowed the creation of a buffer zone between areas with Meitei and Kuki populations. The government claims to have successfully relocated over 50,000 displaced people from both communities. The Centre is also actively addressing other sources of tension, such as the influx of immigrants from Myanmar and the drugs trade. Biometric data is being collected from all immigrants to prevent them from availing citizenship benefits, particularly those who have fled Myanmar due to internal issues, the sources said."

In an exclusive interview with India Today, the minister said that the government has no plans to delay the forthcoming round of assembly elections to hold them later along with the general elections. Thakur dismissed all talk of polls being advanced or delayed as \"media conjecture\". “The government has set up a committee on One Nation, One Election and the committee will do an extensive round of deliberations with stake holders before norms are finalised for One Nation, One Election,” the Union Minister said. The minister said the government would like Adhir Ranjan Choudhary to be a part of the One Nation, One Election committee . “Including the voice of the opposition shows the large heartedness of the Modi government,” he added. The Union minister also hinted that the government has big plans for the special session of Parliament which starts on September 18, but he did not reveal the agenda of the special session. \"The agenda of the special session will be revealed at the appropriate time by the Parliamentary affairs minister,\" Thakur said. The government's announcement comes amid a political firestorm over One Nation, One Election. The Opposition has accused the government of trying to use One Nation, One Election to extend its stay in power. The government has denied these allegations, saying that One Nation, One Election is a constitutional reform that will benefit the country. The One Nation, One Election committee is expected to submit its report within six months. The government will then decide whether to implement the recommendations of the committee. The One Nation, One Election proposal has been met with mixed reactions from political parties and experts. Some have welcomed the proposal, saying that it will save money and improve efficiency. Others have expressed concerns about the feasibility of the proposal and the impact it will have on democracy. The government has said that it is committed to holding wide consultations on the One Nation, One Election proposal before taking any final decision."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story “Neither of us wants to blow this out of proportion,” External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has said about the India-Maldives row in an exclusive and in-depth conversation with India Today. The minister said that a team from the Maldives visited India for two days, adding: “We have an understanding.” During the free-wheeling interaction about his new book, ‘Why Bharat Matters’, Jaishankar spoke about various foreign policy issues, and where India stands on the international stage. The minister addressed key concerns regarding Maldives, China, Pakistan, and the possibility of Donald Trump’s return as a US president. Speaking about the diplomatic tussle with the Maldives, Jaishankar said: “I think that over a period of time, there should not be an issue between us. I think the rest of the relationship is strong -- we have many other things happening -- and I hope that the focus shifts there rather than drag on as unnecessarily on this particular issue.” The minister said India is assessing whether we can have trained non-military personnel to fly medical evacuation aircraft after the Maldives asked India to evacuate its military personnel from the island. On diplomatic relations with China, the minister said while there are “serious problems” and that China is presenting a different posture on the Line of Actual Control, he has stood up to it. “I would say I’ve risen to the challenge in a military sense. The fact that we have been able to deploy so many troops around the year in very hard conditions with a posture which deters Chinese response in fact in many ways itself is an achievement.” He added while criticising previous strategies that in the last decade, there has been a change in the border infrastructure. “In 2020, when the Chinese made a move on the LAC, we were in the middle of a Covid lockdown. I think people don’t fully appreciate that for us to move tens of thousands of troops with that rapidity to those mountains in that cold with the Covid lockdown was a phenomenal logistical operation.” Jaishankar said that to rise to the China challenge, India must manufacture and develop technologies and build infrastructure, adding that these were neglected “even in the era of reform.” Turning to another neighbour, the minister said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted good relations with Pakistan from the moment he was sworn in. In the decade since, however, “the terror industry or infrastructure” has not let up on India in a significant way. According to the minister, the bottom line for India and Pakistan is the issue of terrorism. “There’s no getting away from it,” said Jaishankar. “It’s a problem which has dogged us and one of the reasons it has dogged us for so long is we have not acknowledged its centrality in the past. What has happened since 2014 is that we say that you cannot carry on with cross-border terrorism and say ‘I’d like good relations in all other spheres’.” On prospects of peace between India and Pakistan if Nawaz Sharif wins the Pakistan election, Jaishankar said that unless there is a fundamental reset in thinking on the question of cross-border terrorism, there can’t be much change just because the “cast of characters” changed. He stated that “the issue of terrorism has to be addressed”. Moving further west, towards the United States, Jaishankar addressed concerns of Trump returning to power. He said, “Obviously it matters who is the leader of the most powerful and important country in the world,” adding, “The concerns are largely on the part of allies. Since we don’t fall in that category – we’ve always had an independent position -- we won’t be in a position similar to those which many others have.” The minister further said, “We’ve had very different presidents in the last two and a half decades: Clinton, George W Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden. We have been quite adept at responding to changes in America, at forging new relationships, at building relationships. So, I would say have confidence that both the structural and diplomatic aspects should leave us in a good position.”"

When asked about Aaditya Thackeray's potential to become the Chief Minister, Fadnavis said, \"He (Aaditya Thackeray) was a minister for two and a half years and you can see his performance. Maharashtra is not run by Page 3. He did not even perform as an MLA and if you need proof go and see the Worli constituency\". Fadnavis's Page 3 remark was in connection with Aaditya Thackeray's alleged association with the celebrity club of Mumbai, which several leaders of the BJP keep highlighting to criticise the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader. Several Bollywood actors have been spotted with Aaditya Thackeray in the past. Taking a jibe at Aditya Thackrey Maharashtra Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis said \"Page 3 àä¸àå àä®àä¹àä¾àä°àä¾àä·àåàäàåàä° àäèàä¹àåàä àäàä²àääàä¾\" #News #Maharashtra @rahulkanwal @sahiljoshii @Dev_Fadnavis pic.twitter.com/0Y98VExrYJ — IndiaToday (@IndiaToday) May 12, 2024 Further in his interaction with India Today TV, the BJP leader clarified that Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not make any offer to Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and NCP (SP) supremo Sharad Pawar to join NDA but only gave him advice. \"Claims about PM Modi's offer to Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar to join NDA are wrong. It's not an offer but a piece of advice. I said that Congress is a sinking ship and therefore it is of no benefit to join it. A better option would be to rejoin Shiv Sena (under Eknath Shinde's leadership) and NCP (under Ajit Pawar's leadership),\" Fadnavis said. \"This is not an offer. It is sarcasm and a way to tell them the reality,\" he added. The former Maharashtra Chief Minister also said that it is very difficult to realign with Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena. \"This is very tough. The level of words Uddhav Thackeray uses for PM Modi makes me wonder if he is a tall leader or a low-level politician. Even gram panchayat leaders don't use such language. Our workers cannot tolerate this,\" Fadnavis said."

Addressing reporters on the day the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha commenced, Rahul Gandhi asserted that no power can touch the Constitution. He also showed a booklet of the Constitution to the reporters after giving his brief remarks. \"The attack that the Prime Minister and Amit Shah are launching on the Constitution is not acceptable to us. We will not let this happen. So, we held the Constitution while taking the oath. Our message is going across, and no power can touch the Constitution of India,\" he said. #WATCH | Delhi: When asked about Congress and other Opposition parties carrying copies of the Constitution to the Parliament today, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi says, \"...The attack that the PM and Amit Shah are launching on the Constitution is not acceptable to us, we will not letâæ pic.twitter.com/1d8inFNxEp — ANI (@ANI) June 24, 2024 Rahul Gandhi's remarks came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a swipe at the Congress over the Emergency imposed in 1975, calling it a \"black spot\" on democracy \"when the Constitution was discarded\". On June 25, 1975, the then prime minister Indira Gandhi, a stalwart Congress leader, imposed the Emergency, suspending civil liberties, jailing opposition leaders and dissidents and effecting press censorship. Earlier today, INDIA bloc MPs gathered in the Parliament complex in a show of strength on the first day of the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha, holding copies of the Constitution and raising slogans on \"saving democracy\". Opposition leaders, including Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi, Trinamool Congress's Sudip Bandyopadhyay, DMK's TR Baalu, among others assembled at the spot where the Gandhi statue once stood in the Parliament complex. The statue was recently relocated along with 14 other statues that dotted the complex to a new spot named Prerna Sthal. Former Congress president Sonia Gandhi also joined the MPs. Holding copies of the Constitution in their hands, they raised slogans such as \"long live Constitution\", \"we will save Constitution\", \"save our democracy\"."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Mass protests were held across several districts of violence-hit Manipur on Sunday against heavy security deployment and arrest of village volunteers guarding the settlement areas on the fringes of the state's valley districts. In Imphal, sit-ins were conducted outside the gate of Thangmeiband DM College. In addition, many women protesters also marched towards Chief Minister N Biren Singh's official residence. At the Manipur University gate in Imphal's Canchipur, women were stopped by police from holding a rally. Later, a few of them were allowed to submit their memorandum to the concerned authorities. The protests come days after Union Home Minister Amit Shah convened a high-level meeting to review the security situation in the strife-torn state. Central forces have been deployed at various places across the valley districts in the past few days. Speaking to the media, Sujata Devi, the convenor of an organisation named Imagi Meira Otganis, said they wanted to draw the attention of the central government towards the prevailing situation in Manipur as the Parliament session was ongoing. Commenting on additional forces deployment in the state, Devi said central paramilitary forces should be deployed in far-flung and vulnerable areas. Instead, they are being deployed mainly in valley areas. she added. Another women leader, Ema Nganbj, said the situation in Manipur needed attention from the central government as the people in the state felt threatened by reports of planned mass combing operations and the possible excessive use of brute force. She said the people in the state were already suffering and that excessive use of power by security agencies was not needed at the moment. Manipur has been witnessing ethnic violence since May 3 last year following a tribal solidarity march in the hill districts of the state to protest against the majority Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe status. Over 220 people belonging to both Kuki and Meitei communities and security personnel have been killed in the continuing violence. Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of Manipur's population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley, while tribals, which include Nagas and Kukis, constitute 40 per cent and reside mainly in the hill districts."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A man who appeared for the Bihar Police Subordinate Services Commission (BPPSC) exam was arrested after he was caught attempting to click a picture of the question paper with his mobile phone during the exam held in Patna, police said. The candidate, Swami Vivekanand Kumar Yadav, appeared for the exam on Sunday for the post of Sub Inspector in the Prohibition, Excise and Registration Department and Surveillance Department of BPPSC. Yadav's arrest came against the backdrop of outrage over alleged irregularities in the conduct of the NEET-UG 2024 exam, including paper leak. When Yadav tried to take a photograph of the question paper and send it elsewhere, he was unable to do so as authorities installed jammers to restrict internet access as part of measures to combat malpractices during the exam held at the College of Commerce, Arts and Sciences in Patna, police said. An FIR was registered against Yadav. During interrogation, it was revealed that he had hidden his phone on the college campus on June 21, with the intent of retrieving it later to facilitate cheating. He said he retrieved the phone after being frisked at the entry on the day of the exam, according to police. A total of 1,280 candidates appeared for the BPPSC exam that was divided into two sessions. The first shift, from 10 am to 12 pm, focused on General Hindi, while the second shift, conducted from 2:30 pm to 4:30 pm, centred on General Studies. The attendance rate for the examination stood at approximately 95 per cent. In light of the current scenario regarding the NEET controversy, BPPSC officials installed jammers at the examination centre to prevent any unauthorised communication. Additionally, the centre was under strict CCTV surveillance and had a hotline setup to maintain direct communication with the control room despite the jammers being active. At the time of entry, candidates underwent rigorous checks including photography at the gate, biometric fingerprinting, and comprehensive photography and videography during the examination. Artificial Intelligence (AI) was deployed to match the candidates with the photographs taken at the gate, ensuring that no impersonation took place. Meanwhile, a CBI team from Delhi reached the office of the Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of the Bihar Police in Patna on Monday morning in connection with its investigation into the allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG, officials said. The EOU, which had been investigating the matter until the Centre ordered a probe by the CBI, had arrested 18 people in connection with the case, they said. The CBI on Sunday filed an FIR in connection with the alleged irregularities in NEET-UG, which was held on May 5, on a reference from the Education Ministry, amid countrywide protests and litigations by students."

The flying observatory captured a breathtaking image of NGC 1546, a nearby galaxy in the constellation Dorado, marking its first new observations since transitioning to an alternate operating mode that utilizes a single gyroscope (gyro). The telescope returned to science operations on June 14 after being offline for several weeks due to an issue with one of its gyros, which help control and orient the telescope. This new image showcases NGC 1546's orientation, providing a captivating view of its dust lanes backlit by the galaxy's core. The dust absorbs light from the core, giving it a rusty-brown appearance, while the core itself glows brightly in a yellowish hue, indicating an older population of stars. This Nasa Hubble Space Telescope features the galaxy NGC 1546. (Photo: Nasa) Brilliant blue regions of active star formation sparkle through the dust, and several background galaxies , including an edge-on spiral, are also visible. Captured by Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3, the image is part of a joint observing program between Hubble and NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, which also utilises data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This multi-wavelength approach allows scientists to obtain a highly detailed view of how stars form and evolve. \"Hubble's new image of a spectacular galaxy demonstrates the full success of our new, more stable pointing mode for the telescope,\" said Dr. Jennifer Wiseman, senior project scientist for Hubble at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"We're poised now for many years of discovery ahead, and we'll be looking at everything from our solar system to exoplanets to distant galaxies. Hubble plays a powerful role in NASA's astronomical toolkit.\" Launched in 1990, Hubble has been observing the universe for over three decades, recently celebrating its 34th anniversary."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In a groundbreaking observation, astronomers have captured the first real-time glimpse of a massive black hole awakening from its sleep. The galaxy SDSS1335+0728, previously unremarkable, suddenly began shining brighter than ever before in late 2019, puzzling scientists. \"Imagine you've been observing a distant galaxy for years, and it always seemed calm and inactive,\" says Paula Sánchez Sáez, lead author of the study published in Astronomy & Astrophysics. \"Suddenly, its core starts showing dramatic changes in brightness, unlike any typical events we've seen before.\" While celestial phenomena like supernova explosions can cause galaxies to brighten temporarily, SDSS1335+0728's luminosity has continued to intensify for over four years, an unprecedented duration. Located 300 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo, the galaxy's unusual variations prompted astronomers to seek an explanation. This artist’s impression shows two stages in the formation of a disc of gas and dust around the massive black hole. (Photo: ESO) Using data from observatories like the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (ESO's VLT), the team found that SDSS1335+0728 is now radiating significantly more light across ultraviolet, optical, and infrared wavelengths. In February 2024, it even began emitting X-rays. \"This behavior is unprecedented,\" states Sánchez Saez, also affiliated with the Millennium Institute of Astrophysics in Chile. \"The most tangible option is that we are seeing the awakening of the massive black hole at the galaxy's core.\" Co-author Lorena Hernández Garc­a suggests this could be \"the first time we see the activation of a massive black hole in real time.\" These behemoths, with masses over 100,000 times that of our Sun, typically lie dormant at the centres of galaxies like our own Milky Way. \"In the case of SDSS1335+0728, we were able to observe the awakening of the massive black hole , which suddenly started to feast on gas available in its surroundings, becoming very bright,\" explains Claudio Ricci, another co-author from Diego Portales University. While alternative explanations like an unusually slow tidal disruption event cannot be ruled out yet, the researchers emphasize the unprecedented nature of their observations. \"This process has never been observed before,\" notes Hernandez Garcia. As follow-up studies continue, the awakening black hole in the galaxy offers a unique opportunity to understand how these cosmic giants grow and evolve. \"Instruments like MUSE on the VLT or those on the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope will be key in understanding why the galaxy is brightening,\" says Sanchez Saez."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story As the Paris Olympics inches closer, a consortium of Olympians, climate scientists, and physiologists have raised alarms the acute threat extreme heat poses to the biggest sporting event. They have detailed their concerns in a collaborative report titled \"Rings of Fire.\" Leading athletes are warning that intense heat at the Paris Olympics in July and August 2024 could lead to competitors collapsing and, in the worst-case scenario, dying during the games. Athletes and officials, including Lord Sebastian Coe and athletes from various disciplines, have voiced concerns regarding heat-induced health risks spurred by the historically high 2023 temperatures and the continuation of this heat trend into 2024. 2023 was the hottest year on record. (Photo: AFP) The report concludes with five key recommendations aimed at ensuring athlete and spectator safety and advocating for a reassessment of fossil fuel sponsorship in sports. The University of Portsmouth, Climate Co Central, and Front Runners initiated the report, which is supported by the British Association for Sustainable Sport and Climate Central's expertise. Eleven Olympians, including winners of five world championships and six Olympic medals, have collaborated with climate scientists and leading heat physiologists on the report. \"It is a terrifying prospect when we see the direction things are heading and how rapidly the climate is deteriorating around us,\" says Katie Rood, a striker for New Zealand's football team. \"It's not in an athlete's DNA to stop, and if the conditions are too dangerous, I do think there is a risk of fatalities,\" says Jamie Farndale, a rugby sevens player for Britain. “For athletes, from smaller performance-impacting issues like sleep disruption and last-minute changes to event timings, to exacerbated health impacts and heat-related stress and injury , the consequences can be varied and wide-ranging. With global temperatures continuing to rise, climate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,” says Lord Sebastian Coe, President of World Athletics and four-time Olympic medalist. Kenyan 100m African record holder Ferdinand Omanyala (C) reacts after winning the 100m Men Semifinal during the Kenya Athletics 2024 Paris Olympic Trials. (Photo: AFP) The Tokyo Games became known as the \"hottest in history,\" with temperatures exceeding 34°C and humidity reaching nearly 70%, leading to severe health risks for competitors. The Paris Games have the potential to surpass that, with climate change driven by the burning of fossil fuels contributing to record heat streaks during the past months. 2023 was the hottest year on record according to the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, and 2024 has continued this streak. April 2024 was warmer globally than any previous April in the record books, said experts at Copernicus. The \"Rings of Fire\" report discusses the deadly heatwave in France in 2003 – which killed over 14,000 people – and subsequent years of record-breaking temperatures, exceeding 42°C. It points to the heightened risk of extreme heat during the Paris Olympics, especially considering the significant rise in the region’s temperatures since the city last hosted the Games a century ago. The report has five recommendations for sporting authorities: * Smart scheduling to avoid heat extremes. * Keeping athletes and fans safe with better rehydration and cooling plans. * Empowering athletes to speak out on climate change. * Boosting collaboration between sporting bodies and athletes on climate awareness campaigns. * Reassessing fossil fuel sponsorship in sport. President of Athletics Kenya, General Jackson Tuwei, says: “The findings of this report are grave, but they are unsurprising to us as a country that this year has received such vivid reminders of the devastating impacts of climate change - most recently in the floods that claimed so many lives in April and May. Challenges are mounting for athletes regarding air pollution, food and water insecurity, and lack of shade. And, as this report makes especially clear, the challenges of climate-change-induced extreme heat for athletes are extensive and pose risks of devastating outcomes.” “At [the Tokyo Olympics] I felt like t he heat was bordering on true risk - the type of risk that could potentially be fatal. One of the best tennis players in the world [Medvedev] said he thought someone might die in Tokyo, and I don't feel like that was much of an exaggeration [...]. We sometimes have to play in conditions where an egg can literally be fried on the court. This is not fun or healthy. Heatstroke is relatively common in tennis,” New Zealand tennis player and Olympic bronze medalist Marcus Daniell added. Highest-ranking triathlete in Indian history, Pragnya Mohan, described being exposed to “scary” dangers “that can be fatal” as “your body feels like it’s shutting down” and recounts how she can no longer train in her home country because of the heat. The Olympics are scheduled to be held in Paris between July 26 and August 11 of this year."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Nasa has announced a delay in the return of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft from the International Space Station (ISS), pushing astronaut Sunita Williams's return home once again. The Starliner will return to Earth on June 26. The decision comes as Nasa and Boeing continue to investigate issues encountered during the spacecraft's inaugural crewed mission. Starliner, carrying Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, launched on June 5 and successfully docked with the ISS the following day. However, the spacecraft experienced four helium leaks and five failures of its 28 maneuvering thrusters during the 24-hour flight to the orbital outpost. Steve Stich, Nasa's commercial crew program manager, stated during a news conference that the additional time would allow the team to thoroughly analyze the data and ensure readiness for the spacecraft's safe return to Earth. Upon undocking, the return to Earth is expected to last approximately six hours. (Photo: Nasa) \"The delay of the return of Starliner is intended to give our team a little bit more time to look at the data, do some analysis and make sure we're really ready to come home,\" Stich explained. Starliner's first crewed flight is a crucial milestone in Boeing's long-delayed and over-budget program to certify the spacecraft for routine astronaut missions. Once certified, Starliner will join SpaceX's Crew Dragon as the second U.S. crew vehicle in Nasa's fleet. While Starliner is designed for future six-month missions, the current mission allows for a maximum stay of 45 days docked to the ISS. Nasa is targeting a departure no earlier than June 26, leaving open the possibility for further extensions if necessary. Upon undocking, the return to Earth is expected to last approximately six hours, with a targeted landing in the desert regions of Utah, New Mexico, or other backup locations, depending on weather conditions. The in-flight issues encountered during this mission are the latest challenges Boeing has faced with Starliner, following a failed uncrewed test in 2019 due to software glitches, design problems, and management issues that prevented docking with the ISS. A successful uncrewed test was conducted in 2022."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The solar storm that struck Earth in the early weeks of May was one of the strongest in recent history. The storm triggered a series of auroras, which were seen in several parts of the world, including in India. The storm originated from a massive sunspot region dubbed AR3664 that was spotted rotating into view on Earth's horizon in May. As it came into view, two European probes were on guard to capture the gigantic feature on the surface of the lone star in our solar system. The huge cluster of magnetic field lines was seen emerging and then passing by, offering a glimpse into the dynamic nature of these solar phenomena. The sunspot was first observed by the European Space Agency's Proba-2 in May, as it rotated into view from the Earth's perspective. The large active region produced a powerful X-class solar flare, which could have potentially caused disruptions to technology and infrastructure here on Earth due to its intense burst of radiation and charged particles. As the sunspot rotated out of view, it was observed again from a different vantage point by the ESA-led Solar Orbiter mission , revealing the complexity of these magnetic structures. The combined footage highlights how solar activity like sunspots are constantly evolving, with new regions emerging and existing spots dissipating over time. \"This sunspot region was particularly large and complex, with multiple clusters of magnetic field lines,\" said Dr. Melissa Ortiz, analyzing the sunspot's structure. \"Observing these sunspots from different angles allows us to better understand their magnetic fields and the potential impacts they could have on Earth.\" The Earth's magnetic field is directly influenced by these sunspot regions, which can potentially cause disruptions to power grids , satellite communications, and other critical infrastructure. Tracking these sunspots is crucial for mitigating potential impacts and preparing for any disruptions they may cause. “Solar Orbiter’s position, in combination with other missions watching the Sun from Earth’s side, gives us a 360-degree view of the Sun for an extended period of time. This will only happen three more times in the future of Solar Orbiter,\" Daniel M¼ller, Solar Orbiter Project Scientist explained. The measurements from Solar Orbiter, Mars Express and BepiColombo made it clear that the AR3664 was still very much alive and kicking while out of Earth’s sight. This served as a warning for when the same region rotated back into Earth’s view."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In a remarkable finding, physicists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) have stumbled upon a new series representation for the mathematical constant pi (Ï). They were investigating how string theory can explain certain physical phenomena. String theory is a theoretical framework in physics that attempts to describe all the fundamental forces and particles in the universe. It suggests that the basic building blocks of the universe are not point-like particles, but tiny, vibrating strings. This new formula provides an easier way to extract pi from calculations involved in deciphering processes like the quantum scattering of high-energy particles. The study, published in the prestigious Physical Review Letters journal , was conducted by Arnab Saha, a post-doctoral researcher, and Aninda Sinha, Professor at the Centre for High Energy Physics (CHEP). Arnab Saha (R), a post-doctoral researcher, and Aninda Sinha (L), Professor at the Centre for High Energy Physics (CHEP). Remarkably, under a certain limit, their new series closely matches the representation of pi suggested by the 15th-century Indian mathematician Sangamagrama Madhava, the first recorded series for pi in history. Initially, the researchers were not aiming to find a new way to represent pi. Instead, they were studying high-energy physics in quantum theory, attempting to develop a model with fewer and more accurate parameters to understand how particles interact. \"We were excited when we got a new way to look at pi,\" Sinha said, explaining that their efforts were never intended to find a new representation of pi. Sinha's group is interested in string theory, which treats all quantum processes as different vibration modes of a string. Their work focuses on understanding how high-energy particles interact, such as protons colliding in the Large Hadron Collider, and finding ways to represent these complex interactions using simple factors. Their work focuses on understanding how high-energy particles interact, such as protons colliding in the Large Hadron Collider. (Photo: LHC) To develop an efficient model, Saha and Sinha combined two mathematical tools: the Euler-Beta Function and the Feynman Diagram. Euler-Beta functions solve problems in diverse areas of physics and engineering, while Feynman Diagrams mathematically represent the energy exchange during particle interactions and scattering. Their findings not only provided an efficient model for explaining particle interactions but also yielded a series representation of pi. This series combines specific parameters in such a way that scientists can rapidly arrive at the value of pi, which can then be incorporated into calculations involving high-energy particle scattering. \"Physicists and mathematicians have missed this so far since they did not have the right tools,\" Sinha explained, noting that scientists briefly examined this line of research in the 1970s but abandoned it due to its complexity. Although currently theoretical, Sinha highlights the potential for practical applications, drawing parallels to how Paul Dirac's work on electron motion eventually led to the discovery of the positron and the development of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans used in medical imaging."

This full moon, aptly named the \"Strawberry Moon ,\" earns its fruity title from the relatively short strawberry harvesting season in the northeastern United States. According to the Maine Farmer's Almanac, which began publishing Native American full moon names in the 1930s, the June full moon is called the Strawberry Moon. This name was chosen by Algonquin tribes who tracked the seasons by giving distinct names to each full moon. \"The Strawberry Moon name comes from the relatively short strawberry harvesting season in the northeastern United States,\" explains Dr. Noah Petro, a research scientist at NASA Goddard. \"As the Algonquin tribes observed the moon cycles, they noticed the June full moon coincided with the peak strawberry season.\" This photograph shows a full moon, known as the \"Strawberry Moon\", behind the Temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion. (Photo: AFP) However, the Strawberry Moon has taken on other seasonal monikers by various cultures over time. Some Native American tribes referred to it as the Hot Moon or Planting Moon, signifying the rising summer temperatures. The Europeans had their own names like Honey Moon, Rose Moon, or Mead Moon - the latter referring to the honey-based alcoholic drink that was commonly consumed during this time of year. Beyond its appetising name, the Strawberry Moon itself will be a striking sight. As the full moon closest to the summer solstice , it will appear larger and more orange-hued when rising due to its low trajectory across the horizon. \"When the moon is low on the horizon, we see it through more of the Earth's atmosphere which tends to scatter away the bluer colors, making it appear more reddish-orange,\" explains Petro. \"This is the same reason sunrises and sunsets appear so colourful.\" The June full moon is called the Strawberry Moon. (Photo: AFP) For those in the Northern Hemisphere, the Strawberry Moon will reach its peak at 9:08 PM EDT on June 21st. The moon will appear full for about 3 days total, from the evening of June 20th through the morning of June 23rd. So set your calendars and grab a fresh strawberry snack - the delectable Strawberry Moon will be painting the night skies in just a few weeks' time. As an added treat, this year's summer solstice on June 20th will closely precede the full moon, making for an ideal moon-watching experience."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A significant portion of the methane gas released from the ruptured Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea last September never made it into the atmosphere, according to a new study by researchers from the University of Gothenburg. Their measurements reveal that between 10,000 to 50,000 tonnes of the potent greenhouse gas dissolved into the surrounding seawaters instead. The explosions along the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in late September 2022 caused one of the largest unintentional releases of methane ever recorded. While some of the methane bubbled up to the surface, forming large visible plumes, the Gothenburg team's findings indicate a substantial fraction became dissolved in the Baltic at varying depths. \"Thanks to fortunate circumstances, we were able to organize an expedition to the area of the leak in less than a week,\" said Katarina Abrahamsson, a marine chemistry professor who led the study published in Scientific Reports. \"Based on what we measured, we estimate that between 10,000 and 50,000 tonnes of methane remained in the sea in dissolved form.\" Three months after the initial leak, a follow-up expedition revealed high levels of bacterial activity. (Photo: AP) The researchers distinguished the pipeline methane from gases naturally seeping from seafloor sediments by analyzing its isotopic signature. They found the leaked methane dispersed over large areas at varying concentrations due to the Baltic's stratified water layers. While some dissolved methane will be consumed by bacteria, the long-term impacts on Baltic marine life remain unclear. Abrahamsson notes that plankton samples collected during the expeditions have yet to be fully analysed. Three months after the initial leak, a follow-up expedition revealed high levels of bacterial activity, suggesting microbes were breaking down the dissolved methane. However, the effects on phytoplankton and zooplankton populations are still unknown. The Gothenburg study highlights how even massive gaseous releases can be absorbed into ocean waters, where methane's potent greenhouse effects could persist for decades as it slowly diffuses into the atmosphere. \"Despite the fact that the methane leaked out at great speed and in large quantities, we could not observe any major mixing in the water masses,\" said Abrahamsson, noting the Baltic's stratification remained stable after the ruptures. As the world's oceans continue taking up excess greenhouse gases, long-term monitoring and modelling of these dissolved reservoirs will be crucial for understanding their climate impacts."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The annual Hajj pilgrimage, one of the world's largest religious gatherings, has been marred by tragedy as the death toll surpassed 1,000 amid blistering heat, according to news agency AFP . This staggering loss of life further points to the growing and escalating threat climate change poses as the extreme heat has been a direct result of the phenomenon. Amongst the fatalities, 90 were from India. The vulnerability of pilgrims to heat-related illnesses has exacerbated. (Photo: AFP) The timing of the Hajj is determined by the lunar calendar, which causes the pilgrimage to move back by 10 days annually. While the Hajj is currently shifting towards the winter months, climate scientists warn that by the 2040s, it will coincide with the peak of the scorching Saudi Arabian summer. \"It is going to be very fatal,\" Fahad Saeed, a climate scientist at Climate Analytics based in Pakistan told Reuters. \"Heat-related deaths along the Hajj are not new, and have been recorded back to the 1400s, but the situation will get much worse as the world warms.\" Saeed and his colleague Carl-Friedrich Schleussner published a study in 2021 that found alarming projections. If global temperatures rise by 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the risk of heat stroke for Hajj pilgrims will increase fivefold. Alarmingly, the world is on track to reach this level of warming by the 2030s. The vulnerability of pilgrims to heat-related illnesses is exacerbated by several factors, including lack of acclimatisation to higher temperatures, intense physical exertion, exposure to the elements, and an ageing population. Last year alone, over 2,000 people suffered from heat stress, according to Saudi officials. While Saudi Arabia has implemented measures to mitigate the impact of extreme heat, such as constructing shaded areas, establishing water points, and improving healthcare capacity, these efforts have proven inadequate in the face of the escalating crisis. \"People are very religiously motivated. For some of them, it is a once-in-a-lifetime affair,\" Saeed said, explaining the determination of pilgrims to undertake the Hajj despite the risks. \"If they get a chance, they go for it.\" The staggering death toll during this year's Hajj serves as a sobering glimpse into the future challenges posed by climate change. As global temperatures continue to rise, the risk to human health and life during the Hajj and other outdoor events will become increasingly severe. The timing of the Hajj pilgrimage is determined by the lunar calendar. (Photo: AFP) Climate scientists and public health experts are urging immediate and decisive action to address the climate crisis, not only to protect the sanctity of the Hajj but also to safeguard the well-being of millions of people worldwide who are vulnerable to the impacts of extreme heat. Around 1.8 million people from across the world are expected to attend the pilgrimage this year."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Nasa's Perseverance rover, which has entered a new unexplored world on Mars, is not only collecting rock and soil samples but also capturing valuable atmospheric data in the process. The rover, which has already sealed 24 samples in titanium tubes, is inadvertently providing atmospheric scientists with a unique opportunity to study the Martian atmosphere in unprecedented detail. The titanium sample tubes contain air from Mars. While the primary focus of the Mars Sample Return campaign has been on gathering rock cores and regolith to search for signs of ancient microbial life, the air trapped in the extra space around these samples, known as \"headspace,\" could prove to be an unexpected treasure trove of information. Perseverance continues its mission on Mars. (Photo: Nasa) Brandi Carrier, a planetary scientist at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, explains, \"The air samples from Mars would tell us not just about the current climate and atmosphere, but how it's changed over time. It will help us understand how climates different from our own evolve.\" The headspace in these sample tubes could provide crucial insights into Mars' water cycle, the presence of trace gases, and the composition of the planet's ancient atmosphere. Of particular interest are noble gases such as neon, argon, and xenon, which may have remained unchanged in the Martian atmosphere for billions of years. Justin Simon, a geochemist at Nasa's Johnson Space Center, emphasizes the broader implications of this research: \"Even scientists who don't study Mars would be interested because it will shed light on how planets form and evolve.\" The potential of these atmospheric samples is further highlighted by recent studies of lunar air samples brought back by Apollo 17 astronauts. Using sophisticated gas extraction techniques, scientists were able to analyze the Moon's tenuous atmosphere 50 years after the samples were collected. While the volume of gas in each Perseverance sample tube is small, researchers are considering combining gases from multiple tubes to conduct more comprehensive experiments. This innovative approach could provide a wealth of data on the size and toxicity of Martian dust particles, crucial information for future human missions to the Red Planet. As Perseverance continues its mission on Mars, each rock sample it collects brings with it not just geological data, but also a snapshot of the planet's atmosphere. This unexpected bonus in the Mars Sample Return campaign promises to revolutionise our understanding of Mars' climate history and atmospheric evolution, offering new insights into the formation and development of planets beyond our own."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In a groundbreaking paleontological discovery, scientists have unearthed a new species of horned dinosaur that roamed the subtropical coastal plains of what is now northern Montana in the United States approximately 78 million years ago. They have aptly named it after Loki , the norse god who boasts a two-horned crown. The dinosaur, dubbed Lokiceratops rangiformis, pushes the boundaries of our understanding of ceratopsian dinosaurs and their ecosystems. Measuring about 22 feet long and weighing around 5-1/2 tons, Lokiceratops sported an impressive array of horns, including two curved horns over 16 inches long above its eyes and an asymmetrical pair of blade-shaped horns on its frill, each about two feet in length. These unique features, reminiscent of the Norse trickster god Loki's weaponry, inspired its scientific name. Reconstructed fossil skull bones of Lokiceratops are displayed at the Museum of Evolution in Denmark. Credit: Museum of Evolution Joe Sertich, a paleontologist from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and Colorado State University, suggests that the elaborate headgear was likely used for display, possibly to intimidate rivals or attract mates. The dinosaur's powerful beak indicates it fed on low-growing vegetation such as ferns and flowering plants. Perhaps most intriguing is the discovery that Lokiceratops shared its habitat with four other horned dinosaur species, challenging previous beliefs about ceratopsian diversity in a single ecosystem. Mark Loewen from the University of Utah likens this to finding \"five species of elephants living on the same savanna in Kenya.\" This unexpected richness in ceratopsian species suggests a rapid evolution occurring in a limited geographical region. The findings also parallel patterns seen in mammalian evolution, particularly among bovids in modern-day Africa. Reconstruction of Lokiceratops in the 78-million-year-old swamps of northern Montana, as two Probrachylophosaurus move past in the background. (Artwork by Fabrizio Lavezzi é Evolutionsmuseet, Knuthenborg) The Lokiceratops fossils, found near the U.S.-Canada border, provide valuable insights into the diverse ecosystem of Laramidia, the western landmass of North America during the Cretaceous Period. This discovery not only introduces a new spectacular dinosaur species but also rewrites our understanding of prehistoric biodiversity and ecological dynamics."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Brightly coloured honeycreeper birds, a group of over 50 species and subspecies endemic to Hawaii, are dying, and authorities are going for a last-ditch attempt to save them from extinction. They are releasing millions of mosquitoes from helicopters. According to reports, the archipelago has already seen the extinction of Thirty-three species of honeycreeper and several others are endangered. The honeycreepers, known for their vibrant colours and diverse beak shapes, have been decimated by avian malaria carried by mosquitoes introduced in the 1800s. With no natural immunity to the disease, these endemic birds can succumb to a single infected mosquito bite. \"The only thing that's more tragic is if [the birds] went extinct and we didn't try. You can't not try,\" Chris Warren, forest bird program coordinator for Haleakal&amacr; National Park on Maui, told The Guardian. The situation is dire for species like the KauaÊûi creeper. (Photo: Getty) The innovative strategy involves weekly helicopter drops of 2,50,000 male mosquitoes carrying Wolbachia, a naturally occurring bacteria that acts as a birth control. To date, 10 million mosquitoes have been released. This technique, known as the incompatible insect technique (IIT), aims to reduce the overall mosquito population by preventing the eggs of wild females from hatching when they mate with these modified males. The situation is dire for species like the KauaÊûi creeper, whose population has plummeted from 450 in 2018 to just one known bird in the wild today. As climate change pushes mosquitoes to higher elevations, the birds' last refuges are under threat. This project, led by a coalition including the US National Park Service, the state of Hawaii, and the Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project under the banner \"Birds, Not Mosquitoes,\" represents a race against time. The effectiveness of the program is expected to become apparent during the summer when mosquito populations typically peak. Dr. Nigel Beebe from the University of Queensland, who has researched similar techniques, noted the advantages of this approach over pesticides, especially for conservation efforts. However, he cautions that long-term mosquito elimination remains challenging, particularly for mainland areas."

The study, led by Thomas Winterhalder of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), combined data from ESA's Gaia space telescope with ESO's GRAVITY instrument, revealing eight hidden companions to luminous stars. The research team began by scouring Gaia's catalogue of stellar orbits , identifying eight stars suspected of having companions based on subtle wobbles in their paths. These targets were then observed using GRAVITY, an advanced near-infrared interferometer at ESO's Very Large Telescope in Chile. An artist impression of ESA's Gaia satellite observing the Milky Way. (Photo: ESA) GRAVITY's exceptional sensitivity and resolution allowed the team to detect light signals from all eight predicted companions, seven of which were previously unknown. The discoveries include three small, faint stars and five brown dwarfs - objects with masses between planets and stars. One particularly noteworthy find is a brown dwarf orbiting its host star at a distance comparable to that between Earth and the Sun . This marks the first time such a close-orbiting brown dwarf has been directly imaged. Winterhalder emphasised the significance of this achievement, stating, \"We have demonstrated that it is possible to capture an image of a faint companion, even when it orbits very close to its bright host. This achievement highlights the remarkable synergy between Gaia and GRAVITY.\" The study showcases the power of combining space-based and ground-based observations. Gaia's precise measurements of star positions and movements guided GRAVITY to the exact locations for imaging, allowing it to detect objects at incredibly small separation angles - equivalent to viewing a one-Euro coin from 100 km away. The research team began by scouring Gaia's catalogue of stellar orbits. (Photo: Getty) This breakthrough opens up exciting possibilities for exoplanet detection. The research team is now planning to use this technique to search for planetary companions among the stars in Gaia's catalogue. The study not only revealed hidden companions but also provided valuable data on their masses, ages, and compositions. Surprisingly, two brown dwarfs were found to be less luminous than expected, suggesting they might have smaller companions of their own. This groundbreaking research demonstrates the potential of combining cutting-edge space and ground-based technologies to unlock new discoveries in our cosmic neighborhood, paving the way for future advancements in our understanding of stellar and planetary systems."

The test, known as RLV LEX-03, was conducted at 07:10 IST at the Aeronautical Test Range (ATR) in Chitradurga, Karnataka. This mission marks Isro's third consecutive success in the series of RLV landing experiments , following the achievements of RLV LEX-01 and LEX-02. Pushpak, the winged vehicle, was released from an Indian Air Force Chinook Helicopter at an altitude of 4.5 km. From a release point 4.5 km away from the runway, Pushpak autonomously executed cross-range correction manoeuvres, approached the runway, and performed a precise horizontal landing at the runway centerline. The vehicle's low lift-to-drag ratio aerodynamic configuration resulted in a landing velocity exceeding 320 kmph, compared to 260 kmph for a commercial aircraft and 280 kmph for a typical fighter aircraft. The vehicle's low lift-to-drag ratio aerodynamic configuration resulted in a landing velocity exceeding 320 kmph. (Photo: Isro) After touchdown, the vehicle's velocity was reduced to nearly 100 kmph using its brake parachute, followed by the employment of landing gear brakes for deceleration and stop on the runway. During the ground roll phase, Pushpak utilized its rudder and nose wheel steering system to autonomously maintain a stable and precise ground roll along the runway. The RLV LEX-03 mission re-demonstrated the autonomous landing capability of the RLV under more challenging release conditions , including a cross range of 500 meters against 150 meters for LEX-02 and more severe wind conditions.

An early goal from Scott McTominay gave Scotland the lead, only for Xherdan Shaqiri to equalize swiftly with a stunning strike. Determined to redeem themselves after a humiliating 5-1 loss to hosts Germany, Scotland took the lead in the 13th minute. Andy Robertson made a powerful run down the left wing and passed to Callum McGregor, who set up McTominay. McTominay’s shot took a deflection off Fabian Schar, wrong-footing the Swiss goalkeeper. Switzerland, aiming to advance to the knockout rounds of a sixth consecutive major tournament, responded quickly. Shaqiri capitalised on a defensive error, intercepting a wayward pass and curling a shot into the top corner, leveling the score. The Swiss continued to dominate, creating several opportunities to take the lead. Ricardo Rodriguez narrowly missed with a volley, and Dan Ndoye repeatedly tested Scottish goalkeeper Angus Gunn. Ndoye even had a goal disallowed for offside following a corner kick. Despite being under pressure, Scotland showed resilience, buoyed by their enthusiastic travelling supporters. In the second half, they created several chances to regain the lead. Grant Hanley came close, hitting the post with a header from a cross. McTominay also nearly scored his second of the night with a powerful shot blocked by Manuel Akanji. Swiss coach Murat Yakin's decision to start Shaqiri, despite recent fitness concerns, proved effective as the veteran midfielder was a constant threat to the Scottish defence. Nonetheless, the Scots' transformed performance from their previous disarray against Germany was evident as they confidently moved the ball and tested the Swiss defense. In the end, Scotland’s spirited display earned them a valuable point, keeping their dreams of progressing in the tournament alive, while Switzerland missed the chance to secure early qualification for the knockout rounds alongside Germany. Scotland and Switzerland are now in a straight shootout for the final spot with Hungary being knocked out following the loss to Germany on Wednesday."

He should just play football with his friends. He shouldn't think about the pressure, he's just brilliant playing football...He was brilliant in both games I think, not only the two goals, but I think his offensive positions and ball control is pretty tough for the opponent to defend,\" Nagelsmann said. ð #EURO2024 | #GERHUN pic.twitter.com/qoSBl9POlS — UEFA EURO 2024 (@EURO2024) June 19, 2024 \"I think it’s important for him not to deal with the pressure and just deal with this capability to solve any offensive complications,\" Nagelsmann added. Having already sealed qualification to the Round of 16, we might just see Nagelsmann making limited use of Musiala in the Switzerland clash on June 24, to avoid any risk of injuries. However, the 21-year-old has established himself as one of thbe untouchable players in the Germany squad on top of some brilliant performances for both club Bayern Munich and country."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Serbia substitute Luka Jovic headed a last-gasp equaliser to cancel out Zan Karnicnik's opener and salvage a 1-1 draw with Slovenia in an absorbing Group C clash at Euro 2024 on Thursday. Both sides hit the woodwork and had periods where they dominated possession and created chances at the Munich Football Arena in a game that swung from end-to-end at times. The result puts Slovenia in second place on two points with leaders England, who have three, to come in their final group game. Serbia, bottom with one point, next face Denmark, who also have one point and play England later on Thursday. Slovenia remain unbeaten and still firmly in contention to progress to the knockout stage of the tournament. For Serbia, the point also bolsters their hopes of progressing. Serbia manager Dragan Stojkovic praised Slovenia's discipline and bemoaned the fact that despite creating 15 goal attempts his side did not score until almost the final whistle. \"We created chances,\" Stojkovic said. \"It was incredible how the ball did not want to enter the goal.\"(With Denmark) it will be us or them. We will play an open game.\" JoviÄ salvages point for Serbia ð·ð¸ Match report ðï¸â¬ï¸ #EURO2024 | #SVNSRB — UEFA EURO 2024 (@EURO2024) June 20, 2024 Just like in their 1-0 opening defeat against England, Serbia started slowly and handed the initiative to Slovenia whose first big chance came when Timi Elsnik hit the near post after dribbling into the box in the first half. Slovenia broke the deadlock after the break with a brilliantly worked goal from man-of-the-match Karnicnik who put them on the brink of their first ever Euros win. Slovenia had missed several good chances until right back Karnicnik drove upfield from the edge of his own penalty area, released the ball to Elsnik and then met the return cross to slot the ball past Predrag Rajkovic in the 69th minute. GREAT ATMOSPHERE Slovenia coach Matjaz Kek thanked his players for their efforts in what he called a great atmosphere but said they ran out of steam towards the end of the contest. \"Slovenia has shown that it has a place here at the European Championship,\" Kek said. \"Sport and football in general can be cruel but I believe karma will do its part for this team. \"We have felt disappointment because we know how strong the Serbia players are. There was a bit of a lack of concentration, perhaps a bit of a lack of strength in the last minutes.\" Serbia ratcheted up the pressure looking for an equaliser with veteran striker Aleksandar Mitrovic hitting the post, and they finally levelled when Jovic nodded home a corner five minutes into added time to leave their opponents distraught. Serbia had failed to capitalise on periods of superiority despite the menace of Mitrovic, who saw a close range shot deflected by Karnicnik onto the woodwork, until Jovic struck. \"They were the better team in the first half but we prevailed in the second,\" Mitrovic said. \"We created a lot of chances and I was especially unlucky. We kept going until the end.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story England will have to wait to secure a berth in the knockout stage of the European Championship after a 1-1 draw with Denmark on Thursday, a game that Harry Kane brought to life with an early goal but which ended with the Three Lions clinging on for a single point. Despite the result, England retains the top spot with four points, while Denmark is second with two points. It was a second successive lacklustre performance from Gareth Southgate's men, who squandered the chance to become the first England team to win their two opening games at a Euro tournament. The draw leaves the 2020 runners-up, previously touted as tournament favourites, at the top of Group C on four points, while Denmark are second on two after Slovenia's 1-1 draw with Serbia earlier. The game got off to a sloppy start with wayward passes from both teams, quickly silencing the sea of red and white fans, a crowd that included the Prince of Wales and Denmark's King Frederik. But Kane — who has now scored more goals at major tournaments than any other England player with 13 — got England on the scoreboard in the 18th minute when Kyle Walker swooped in behind an unsuspecting Victor Kristiansen and fired in a cross that eventually fell to Kane. The captain lunged and sent a left-footed shot from close range into the bottom left corner. The goal draws him level with Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney as the players to score for England at the most major tournaments, with four apiece. Denmark were the better team after that, however, and an equaliser felt inevitable. The Danes capitalised on England's sloppy play in the 34th minute when Kane's pass up the field from a throw-in went to Kristiansen, who passed to Hjulmand. The 24-year-old launched a rocket from about 30 yards out that ricocheted off the left post and into the net. England keeper Jordan Pickford barely saw it coming, and waved a frustrated finger at his teammates. Denmark were the sharper team thereafter, as their midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg appeared to acknowledge afterwards. \"I would have traded it for three points,\" he said of his man of the match award. \"We played well, we played smart, annoying that we couldn't get one to go in. We have a lot we can take with us, we have to keep looking ahead and do it, we have time.\" Looking to inject some fresh legs and energy, Southgate took off Kane, Phil Foden, and Bukayo Saka with about 20 minutes to play and replaced them with Ollie Watkins, Jarrod Bowen, and Eberechi Eze. Both teams squandered chances, however, the narrowest miss coming from Foden, who rang a shot off the post in the second half in a far more lively performance from him on Thursday than in the Serbia game."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story French superstar Kylian Mbappe has unveiled a specially designed mask he will wear for the remainder of Euro 2024 following a broken nose sustained in France's opening match. The French captain suffered the injury during his team's 1-0 victory over Austria on Monday. The 25-year-old forward was spotted at France's training base in Paderborn on Wednesday, sporting a protective covering over his nose. Initially, he trained separately from the rest of the squad but later joined them for shooting drills. By Thursday, Mbappe was training with a new mask adorned in the tricolore colors of the French flag. However, UEFA regulations require any protective mask to be a single uniform color, potentially necessitating a redesign for future matches. Although Mbappe's injury does not require immediate surgery, the French team is closely monitoring his condition and has refrained from providing a specific timeline for his return. With Friday's crucial match against the Netherlands fast approaching, the new mask hints that Mbappe could make a swift return to the lineup. Teammates have been optimistic about his recovery. Midfielder Adrien Rabiot expressed confidence in Mbappe's quick comeback during a press conference in Paderborn. \"A fractured nose isn't the end of the world,\" Rabiot stated through a translator, adding, \"Kylian should be with us pretty soon.\" ð­ðëð· Kylian Mbappe’s mask is ready. pic.twitter.com/f7XksZFfFF — Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) June 20, 2024 Defender William Saliba also provided an update, saying he had spoken to Mbappe, who was feeling \"a bit better\" following the injury. Mbappe's nose was broken during a collision with Austria defender Kevin Danso, resulting in heavy bleeding that stained parts of his white France jersey red. \"I saw him this morning, he was a bit better,\" Saliba shared. \"I think he was off to do more tests. I don't know anything more. But when I saw him this morning, he was a bit better.\" Rabiot drew a comparison to a similar injury suffered by Juventus teammate Wojciech Szczesny, who broke his nose in April, underwent surgery, and returned to play the following week."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Spain sealed a spot in the UEFA Euro 2024 Round of 16 after clinching a dominant 1-0 win over defendig champions Italy on June 21 at the Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. The win showcased Spain's clear upper-hand over Lucinao Spalletti-managed Italy throughout the match in a rather ruthless manner. It was quite a surprising outcome that the decisive moment of the match came from a 55th minute own goal from Riccardo Calafiori. The win meant a sealed spot in the Round of 16 stage of Euro 2024 for Spain, and an extended fight for the same for Italy. The match, which was highly-expected to be an end-to-end thriller by football fans, ultimately showcased Spain's utter dominance over Italy. Be it possession, attacking runs or playmaking, coach Luciano Spalletti's Italy were just no match for the consistently brilliant and persistent attacking abilities of Luis de la Fuente's Spain. Across the entirety of the match, Italy had only taken two shots from which none amongst them were on target, quite a staggering statistic for a side that is the defending champions of the European Championship. ðªð¸ Spain through to the round of 16 as group winners ð #EURO2024 | #ESPITA pic.twitter.com/BDj2p5N1nu — UEFA EURO 2024 (@EURO2024) June 20, 2024 It is a rather un-just turn of outcome that it was an own goal that gave Spain the lead and not through someone from their end. The likes of Lamine Yamal, Nico Williams and Marc Cucurella were clearly the stand-out names for the Spanish brilliance, which saw the former two be a consistent threat to the Italy backline, and the latter be a warrior in the defence. Cucurella in Puyol mode ðä #EURO2024 | #ESPITA pic.twitter.com/mstxCPyFO2 — UEFA EURO 2024 (@EURO2024) June 20, 2024 For Italy, Gianluigi Donnarumma will be remembered as the most positive outcome from the match. The Italy goalkeeper and skipper was absolutely relentless between the posts and was easily the difference maker in the side against a massively threatening Spanish attack. A brilliant long-range shot from Fabian Ruiz in the latter part of the first half, a low-paced shot from Alvaro Morata and then again a rocket-shot in the second-half, Donnarumma had an answer to all. Donnarumma denies Pedri, Morata & Fabián Ruiz... #EURO2024 | #ESPITA pic.twitter.com/UxubJ8F5OK — UEFA EURO 2024 (@EURO2024) June 20, 2024 It is criminally unfortunate that the only time that Donnarumma was by his own teammate Riccardo Calafiori, who netted the 55th minute own goal. Although the defence did put in occasional good shifts by the likes of Calafiori himself and even Andrea Cambiaso, Italy will have to head to the chalkboard to get their approach sorted out. Spain's brilliant but fruit-less first half could be similar to a collage of attacking runs by Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams. It only sets up as a image for Spanish football's bright future, when 16-year-old Yamal and 21-year-old Williams were the two most threatening figures for a well-established Italy defence. While Yamal;s runs had mostly been about greeting brilliant spaces from between the Azzurri legs, Williams came the closest to scoring with a chance for a free-header in the 11th minute of the game. Yamal ðè #EURO2024 | #ESPITA pic.twitter.com/KxFwy9X061 — UEFA EURO 2024 (@EURO2024) June 20, 2024 ð #EURO2024 | #ESPITA pic.twitter.com/O1J692vqns — UEFA EURO 2024 (@EURO2024) June 20, 2024 Speed, quick movement of feet and man awareness - these are similar traits that these two players carry and that is something which can give many moments of celebration in the near future. ð® #EURO2024 | #ESPITA pic.twitter.com/bRMhzqVNEJ — UEFA EURO 2024 (@EURO2024) June 20, 2024 However, both of these players also have a certain loose end when it comes to their finishing abilities, something that screams to get polished to complete brilliance. Williams might have been the player who was most deserving of a goal in the Spanish side. His brilliant strike at goal in the 70th minute shows that it won't take him time to finally get his name up on the scoresheet sooner than later,"

Alvarez broke the deadlock in the 49th minute with Martinez ensuring victory two minutes from time. Lionel Messi marked his record 35th match in his seventh Copa America tournament, surpassing Chilean goalkeeper Sergio Livingstone's record of 34 appearances between 1942 and 1953. \"We knew it was going to be a tough game. We knew that Canada was going to be a hard team to go against,\" Messi told Fox via a translator. \"They were physical, very physical. In the first half, there was little space. It was intense, physically intense and strong and then in the second half we were able to progress and get better.\" Canada gave Argentina a run for their money in the first half and nearly found a breakthrough just before halftime. Cyle Larin's cross into the box found Stephen Eustaquio, whose header was saved by Emiliano Martinez. Alphonso Davies' subsequent shot soared over the bar. Argentina seized control in the second half after a challenging first 45 minutes. The breakthrough came when Messi's pass led Alexis Mac Allister into the box. The midfielder collided with oncoming Canadian goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau, allowing the ball to slip free for Alvarez to end his 13-match international goal drought. Alvarez's last goals came during the 2022 World Cup semi-finals against Croatia. Messi came close to finding the back of the net in the 65th minute but his shot was saved by Crepeau and his rebound effort was headed away by defender Derek Cornelius. He had another chance in the 80th minute but his shot rolled just wide. Messi then set up substitute Martinez for Argentina's second, Serie A's top goalscorer squeezing his shot under Crepeau. \"We've been in that situation before in the World Cup and we know that we have to bounce back in the second game,\" Canada's Eustaquio told TSN. Chile and Peru, the other teams in Group A, play their opener on Friday in Arlington, Texas. In the group's next set of fixtures on Tuesday, Argentina face Chile while Canada take on Peru."

In a bombshell press conference, Stimac made several allegations against the All India Football Federation and said that the body failed to recognise that FIFA World Cup Qualifiers were bigger than the Asian Cup. The Croatian revealed that he was given a final warning before the Asian Cup for trying to convince the AIFF about the importance of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Stimac said that the meeting resulted in him going to the hospital and getting urgent surgery done because he could not take the stress. \"After I told them that the World Cup Qualifiers were more important than Asian Cup. I received final warning from AIFP. When I received the final warning on December 2. no one knows this, I finished in the hospital. I was disturbed with everything going on; stressed from the obvious problems. I had an immediate surgery on my heart. I wasn't ready to speak to anyone or find excuses. I was ready to put myself on the line to prepare my team for the Asian Cup to give the best shot,\" Igor Stimac said in the press conference on Friday, June 21. Igor Stimac Sacked: Details \"Not surprised about parting ways. Most of my senior players knew I had decided to leave even after had qualified for the third round. It was impossible for me to go on without proper support, full of lies and people who had only private interests,\" he further added. Igor Stimac had earlier promised that he would reveal a lot of things about the worrying state of Indian football. In his Twitter post, the Croatian thanked the Indian football fans and the team management for their support throughout his struggle-filled 5-year tenure with the side. After an important virtual meeting between head officials at the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on June 17, the board came up with the decision to close Stimac's chapter with the Indian team after a string of lacklustre performances."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Indian football team head coach Igor Stimac was sacked on June 17 after his team failed to make it to the third round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers. After his sacking, an agitated Stimac wrote on Twitter that he will hold a tell-all press conference where he would expose several people in Indian football. On Friday, 21 June, Stimac, in a virtual press conference made bombshell allegations against the All India Football Federation. Speaking to a host of reporters from across India, Stimac alleged that Indian football was imprisoned in the hands of power-hungry people and was unlikely to reach a good level in the next 20 years. Stimac took sharp digs at the AIFF stating alleging that he was incorrectly sacked. \"I came with an open heart to Indian football. But your football is imprisoned. It will take a couple of decades for things to improve which I don't see happening,\" Stimac said in his virtual press conference. \"Not surprised about parting ways. Most of my senior players knew I had decided to leave even after had qualified for the third round. It was impossible for me to go on without proper support, full of lies and people who had only private interests,\" he further added. In the same press conference, Stimac said that he was not able to take the stress of the Indian coaching job and had to get heart surgery before the Asian Cup. The former head coach also alleged that no one in the AIFF knew how to run Indian football. “The people in AIFF don’t know how to run a football house, they don’t know how to organise cups. These people only care about power,” Stimac said. The former coach was furious with the functioning of the AIFF and said that the Indian team did not get any technical help from the federation. \"IM Vijayan was a fantastic player but he shouldn't be the one presiding over the technical committee (TC). I told the AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey that during each camp we should have one of the members of the TC to be in the team and see what kind of work we do and what we provide our players. You think they sent someone? No one was there,\" the former head coach further added. The All India Football Federation had announced on Monday, 17 June that Igor Stimac has been relieved of his duties as the head coach of the Indian men's football team. This decision follows a disappointing campaign in the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers. The senior officials of the AIFF had an important virtual meeting which was led AIFF Vice President N.A. Haris with other key attendees included Menla Ethenpa, Anilkumar Prabhakaran, I.M. Vijayan, Climax Lawrence, and M. Satyanarayan."

The football body's comments came after Stimac vented it out in an explosive press conference, days after he was sacked as the head coach of the senior national team. Igor Stimac took a direct jibe at AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey, saying the sport will grow in the county only if he leaves the post. The Croatian tactician said India is the only country in which football, as a sport, is not growing. \"It has come to our attention that former India men’s team head coach Mr. Igor Stimac has made certain remarks in the media pertaining to functioning of the All India Football Federation and some of its senior officials. The AIFF will issue a statement in this regards in the next 48 hours,\" the AIFF said in a statement on Friday. Igor Stimac had promised to give his account of the Indian football saga and sent a message to his \"media friends\" on Thursday. During a lengthy press conference on Friday, 4 days after he was sacked, Stimac lashed out at the administration, saying Indian football is \"imprisoned\" . Stimac, who was part of the Croatian team that finished third in the 1998 FIFA World Cup, also said he was tried of \"lies and unfulfilled promises\" during his tenure. Stimac, who was appointed in 2019, was sacked after India failed to make it to the third round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers. India were held to a tame 0-0 draw in Kolkata earlier in the month before losing to Qatar 2-1 in Doha. \"In my career, I've not been sacked till now, this was the first time. And it was wrongly so - in my reply to AIFF I've done the same,\" Stimac said on Friday. \"It was impossible for me to continue without enough support, I was fed up of the lies, the unfulfilled promises and being surrounded by people who are only thinking about their own interests,\" Stimac said from Croatia. Stimac also said he was warned before the AFC Asian Cup earlier this year after he tried to educate the administrators about the importance of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers. The Croatian said the stress related to the job during that phase forced him to undergo surgery for a heart condition. \"After I told them that the World Cup Qualifiers were more important than the Asian Cup, I received a final warning from AIFF. When I received the final warning on December 2, no one knows this, I finished in the hospital. \"I was disturbed with everything going on; stressed from the obvious problems.

Harry Kane gave the Three Lions an early lead, but Denmark quickly responded with a stunning goal from Morten Hjulmand, leveling the score and ensuring a tightly contested match. Despite England's dominance in possession, Gareth Southgate's team was limited to just four shots on target, thanks in part to a solid defensive performance and Kasper Schmeichel's dependable goalkeeping. Following the match, Kasper was interviewed by his father, Peter Schmeichel, who is now a pundit for FOX Sports. The interview concluded with a touching moment when Peter, a Manchester United legend and one of the greatest goalkeepers in history, hugged his son live on air. \"I do a lot of post-match interviews, but I never do this,\" Peter said before the emotional moment. The wholesome interaction continued as Kasper handed his father his match-worn shirt, prompting a chuckle from Peter. \"Ah, here you go!\" he said, before the pair shared a handshake and walked off-screen with broad smiles. Touching moment between Peter & Kasper Schmeichel. ðå¹ðéð° pic.twitter.com/6FR2BzLWNM — Man United Fan Club (@manufcnow) June 21, 2024 Reflecting on the match, Kasper expressed his pride in Denmark's performance. \"I am very proud,\" he said during the FS1 broadcast. \"That's the Denmark I know. We didn't win, but the expression of the game, the fight, the heart, the fans, that's the real Denmark. There is always a tinge of disappointment when we don't win, but when you look at the game, it is probably a fair result.\" Kasper Schmeichel, now 37, is the most senior player in the Danish squad, boasting 102 caps for his country. Currently playing for Anderlecht after a stint at OGC Nice, Kasper's career has been impressive in its own right. He famously won the Premier League with Leicester City in the 2015/16 season, a remarkable achievement against the odds. His father's career, however, remains one of the most illustrious for a goalkeeper. Peter Schmeichel won five Premier League titles with Manchester United and was part of the historic treble-winning team in 1999. He also played a crucial role in Denmark's 1992 European Championship victory."

Trailing at halftime on an early goal by Ivan Schranz, Ukraine's prospects looked bleak, but they staged a spirited comeback in front of their jubilant fans. Slovakia, fresh off a surprising win against Belgium in their opening match, could have secured a last-16 spot with another victory. However, after a promising start, they faltered by adopting a defensive stance. Mykola Shaparenko equalized in the 54th minute with a close-range finish. The decisive moment came when Yaremchuk controlled a lofted pass from Shaparenko and skillfully beat Slovakia's goalkeeper, Martin Dubravka. This victory brought Ukraine level on three points with Slovakia and Romania, who are set to face Belgium on Saturday. Slovakia, much like at Euro 2020, had impressed with an opening win against Belgium but eventually exited at the group stage. Determined to avoid a repeat, they dominated the early exchanges on a rain-slicked pitch in D¼sseldorf. Yaremchuk's wondergoal seals a comeback win for Ukraine! ðºðæ #EURO2024 | #SVKUKR pic.twitter.com/ok1odRPi7S — UEFA EURO 2024 (@EURO2024) June 21, 2024 Ukraine's goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin, one of five changes from the team that lost 3-0 to Romania, made crucial saves to deny Lukas Haraslin and Schranz's close-range effort. Slovakia's positive start was rewarded in the 17th minute when Haraslin's precise cross was headed in by Schranz at the far post, his second goal of the tournament after his winner against Belgium. With their tournament hopes looking as gloomy as the D¼sseldorf sky, Ukraine finally came to life. Mykhailo Mudryk fired a shot over the bar, had another effort blocked by defender Peter Pekarik, and saw Oleksandr Tymchyk hit the post with a low drive. Dubravka was called into action again to save a free kick from Oleksandr Zinchenko, while Slovakia nearly doubled their lead on the counterattack, with Haraslin's shot well saved by Trubin. Ukraine started the second half aggressively, and Artem Dovbyk, last season's top scorer in La Liga, narrowly missed connecting with a Mudryk cross. Their pressure paid off a minute later when Shaparenko, left unmarked, was picked out by Zinchenko's deft pass and calmly slotted a left-footed shot into the corner. Slovakia seemed content to hold on for a draw but were lucky when Mudryk's shot from an acute angle struck the post with 15 minutes remaining. Ukraine's determination paid off as Yaremchuk, set up by the outstanding Shaparenko, scored the winner, sending their war-torn nation into the final group game full of hope."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A superb second-half performance by Austria kick-started their hopes of making the Euro 2024 knockout stage with a 3-1 win over Poland on Friday, with Gernot Trauner, Christian Baumgartner and Marko Arnautovic all getting on the scoresheet. The Austrians, who lost to France in their opener, survived a spirited first-half comeback in which Poland equalised and came close to taking the lead before the wheels came off in the second half as they slumped to a second loss in the tournament. Undeterred by news that record scorer Robert Lewandowski was still not fit to start, Polish fans lit a handful of flares as they belted out the national anthem, with a cloud of smoke wafting towards the goal Austria defended in the first half. EURO 2024: FULL COVERAGE That was about as close as the Poles got in the opening exchanges, with Austria dominating possession through repeated attacks up the left flank and going ahead in the ninth minute. Philipp Mwene's long throws were a threat from the start and Austria's goal came when one of them was headed back into his path, allowing the left back to cross for Trauner to score with a bullet header into the top corner after nine minutes. However, Poland levelled on the half-hour mark as Austria failed to clear a corner satisfactorily and when Trauner blocked a shot from Jan Bednarek, the ball fell kindly for Krsysztof Piatek to control and then steer into the net. Austria goalkeeper Patrick Pentz had to pull off a superb one-handed save in first-half stoppage time and when Lewandowski finally entered the fray on the hour Polish hopes rose, only to be quickly dashed. Austria's second goal in the 66th was beautiful in its simplicity as they switched play from right to left before Alexander Prass picked out Baumgartner with a pinpoint pass and the midfielder's cool finish gave Wojciech Szczesny no chance. When Marcel Sabitzer then tore through the middle, Szczesny had no choice to bring him down and Marko Arnautovic drilled the resulting spot kick low to the keeper's left to make it 3-1 after 78 minutes and leave the Poles with a mountain to climb. Though they still have a chance of making it through to the knockout stage, Poland will be unable to finish in the top two should France avoid defeat by the Netherlands later on Friday. The Poles face France in their final group game on Tuesday in Dortmund when Austria taking on the Dutch in Berlin."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story There were plenty of sparks, but no goal in the first 0-0 draw of Euro 2024 in Leipzig on Friday, June 21. And it surprisingly came in a Group D game between two powerhouses of European football -- France and the Netherlands. With Kylian Mbappe, who was dropped to the bench after he suffered a broken nose earlier in the week, taking no part in the game, the shooting boots were missing in an entertaining contest. Euro 2024: Full Coverage Xavi Simon's second-half goal was chalked off by a debatable VAR decision as the Netherlands were forced to settle for the draw. Questions will be asked of the call which saw Denzel Dumfries ruled off-side for standing in the direction of French goalkeeper Mike Maignan's line of sight when Simon deposited a rebound into the back of the net. Maignan was not able to dive when the ball was travelling towards his left, as Dumfries was standing in the way, but the ball did not make contact with the Inter Milan star. There was tension in the stadium when the VAR check was going on as the Dutch fans were holding their breadth, waiting in anticipation. There was disappointment for those in orange while the French fans knew the rub of green went their way. France were lucky that they were not punished for their wasted chances -- 12 attempts and 3 on target with nothing to show for. ØçÙÄØ­Ø³ØçØè ØçÙÄØçØ³ØçØ³Ù | âæ @iT7HD pic.twitter.com/G5sDOsQe2u — EURO2024 (@Mayola85753) June 21, 2024 \"As a Frenchman, this decision is shocking,\" Patrice Evra, who was on air for Sony Sports, said after the game ended in a 0-0 draw. Former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who was watching the game from the stands, was baffled by the VAR call. Nonetheless, the backlines of both France and the Netherlands deserve a lot of credit for keeping the high-quality attackers quiet. France had the better chances with Antonio Griezmann denied a close-range effort before Simon's goal was not given. Griezmann's long-range effort was also saved by Bart Verbruggen, who was on top form for the Dutch between the sticks on Friday. Netherlands are on top of the Group D table tied on points (4) with France, thanks to their extra tally of goals scored. Both teams are looking set to make it to the last 16 in a group that also has Poland and Austria. Notably, Austria routed Poland 3-1 in their game in Berlin earlier on Friday. Netherlands will face Austria in their final Group D game and even a draw will be enough for them to secure a spot in the Round of 16. On the other hand, France will face Poland, who are already out of the race to the knockout stage."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story European Championship newcomers Georgia held the Czech Republic to a 1-1 draw on Saturday, taking a shock lead through a Georges Mikautadze penalty before an equaliser off the chest of Patrik Schick. Though Georgia will be proud of a first point at a major tournament against a team ranked 40 places higher, it could have been even better, substitute Saba Lobjanidze squandering a glorious chance to win the game at the death. Both teams have one point from two games and need to win their final Group F match to progress to the knockout stages in Germany. In an intense game at Hamburg's Voklsparkstadion, Mikautadze sent Czech goalkeeper Jindrich Stanek the wrong way with his spot-kick in the fourth minute of first-half stoppage time after a handball by Robin Hranac. The 23-year-old Mikautadze's second goal of the tournament sent Georgia's white-clad fans into ecstasy. REPORT: Mikautadze's first-half penalty was cancelled out by Schick's goal in an action-packed draw in Hamburg ð°ð #EURO2024 | #GEOCZE — UEFA EURO 2024 (@EURO2024) June 22, 2024 That came against the run of play after the Czechs had dominated, with Schick having two efforts well saved, Vaclav Cerny scuffing the ball when it looked easier to score, and Adam Hlozek having a goal disallowed for handball. Schick got the equaliser the Czechs deserved, however, in the 59th minute, steering the ball in with his chest after Ondrej Lingr's glancing header from a corner bounced off the post. In a concern for the Czechs' next game against Turkey, Schick - joint top scorer with five goals at the last Euros - limped off soon after his goal. \"Of course, 1-1 is not enough for us. We were better, we had more chances. Their goalie caught everything in the first half, then the penalty came,\" said Schick, whose goal took him past Milan Baros as top Czech scorer at European Championships with six. \"In the end we were able to equalise. We were going at them but we were not able to score a second goal and we made a stupid mistake and could have lost.\" LOBJANIDZE'S BIG MISS As in their opening match against Turkey, Georgia relied on stout defending and counter-attacks against the Czechs, who had 55% of possession and 26 attempts on goal. \"We had a bit of bad luck today, we had chances to win, but in the end we managed to draw and the point may after all mean qualifying, we have no options left but to win against the Turks,\" Lingr said. For Georgia, winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia - nicknamed \"Kvara-dona\" by fans in comparison with Argentina's great Diego Maradona - was a menace while Anzor Mekvabishvili squandered a great chance to give Georgia a 2-0 lead. But it was Lobjanidze who will have sleepless nights after he missed his big opportunity in front of the main Georgian fans' section to write his name into history. Instead of hitting the ball low into one of the spaces either side of goalkeeper Stanek, he leant back slightly and the ball went over. Lobjanidze sank to his knees distraught at the final whistle seconds later and was consoled by team mates. \"He's a great football player and he will definitely score a goal in the coming matches. Of course, it was a very important moment, but he needs to keep going,\" said Georgia's goalkeeper and man of the match Giorgi Mamardashvili. \"He should be proud because we earned our first point against the Czech Republic.\" Turkey face Portugal later on Saturday in the other Group F game"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Portugal stormed into the round of 16 of Euro 2024 as Group F winners, following a 3-0 victory over Turkey on Saturday. Goals from Bernardo Silva, an own goal by Samet Akaydin, and a Bruno Fernandes tap-in sealed the win for the Seleç£o. Bernardo Silva opened the scoring in the 21st minute, netting his first goal at a major tournament. A deflected cross from Nuno Mendes fell perfectly for Silva, who fired home to give Portugal the lead. Seven minutes later, a defensive mishap from Turkey saw Akaydin mistakenly pass the ball into his own net, with goalkeeper Altay Bayindir stranded off his line. Bruno Fernandes ended any hopes of a Turkish comeback in the 56th minute. Cristiano Ronaldo, on the brink of becoming the oldest goalscorer in European Championship history, unselfishly set up Fernandes for a simple finish. This marked the final blow in a match that Portugal controlled from start to finish. Portugal's aggressive start set the tone early on. Ronaldo tested Bayindir within the first two minutes, showing Portugal's intent despite the vociferous Turkish support. Turkey, aiming to break their European Championship scoring drought against Portugal, had a chance through Orkun K¶kc¼, but veteran defender Pepe's crucial intervention kept them at bay. Portugal through to the round of 16 as Group F winners ðµð¹ð #EURO2024 | #TURPOR pic.twitter.com/1or9rJ7Icq — UEFA EURO 2024 (@EURO2024) June 22, 2024 The opening goal came from a swift counter-attack down the left flank. Mendes' dangerous cross was met by Silva, whose strike marked a significant personal milestone. Portugal doubled their lead bizarrely shortly after, as Akaydin's misguided backpass trickled into the net with Bayindir helplessly out of position. Turkey's best opportunity came from Kerem Akturkoglu, whose effort was brilliantly saved by Diogo Costa. However, clear chances were few and far between for Vincenzo Montella's side. The second half saw Portugal in full control, and they extended their lead through a well-executed play involving substitute Ruben Neves, Ronaldo, and Fernandes. A long pass from Neves found Ronaldo, who provided an easy assist for Fernandes to score. Despite Turkey introducing teenage sensation Arda G¼ler, the game concluded without further incident, save for multiple pitch invaders seeking selfies with Ronaldo in the final 20 minutes. Portugal's victory ensures their advancement to the knockout stages, while Turkey faces a crucial match against the Czech Republic on Wednesday to determine their fate. The Czechs, who drew 1-1 with Georgia earlier on Saturday, will be determined to secure their spot in the last-16 as well."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A goal by Youri Tielemans after 73 seconds and a late one for Kevin De Bruyne gave Belgium a 2-0 win over Romania in an incredible, action-packegame on Saturday that set up a final round showdown with all four teams in Group E on three points. It was a Euro 2024 Saturday night special played in an astonishing atmosphere in Cologne, with the only mystery being how there were only two goals. It meant that, for the first time in European Championship history, all four teams in a group are on equal points after two rounds, following Ukraine's 2-1 win over Slovakia on Friday. All outcomes are now available on the final night on Wednesday when Belgium play Ukraine and Slovakia play Romania, where four points could be enough to top the group but could also see a team eliminated. Romania and Belgium have the advantage with a plus-one goal difference. Slovakia are on zero and Ukraine on -2 - with those goal differences the deciding factor should both games end level. \"We were very relieved we won the game, it was very important to get three points,\" said Belgium coach Domenico Tedesco. \"Romania gave us a bit more space that Slovakia but with the quality and quantity of our chances it would have been good if we could have scored more early on - four or five goals tonight would have been possible.\" Belgium, still somehow ranked third in the world by FIFA, were unrecognisable from the sluggish side shocked by Slovakia in their opening game , pouring forward and full of energy from the first whistle. It paid dividends immediately as Romelu Lukaku held up the ball with his back to goal before rolling it into the path of Tielemans, who drilled home a crisp, low shot. Four minutes later Romania went close with a header by Radu Dragusin that Koen Casteels saved well, but it was a brief respite as Belgium ran the first-half show. Dodi Lukebakio’s fierce shot was well saved by Florin Nita after a trademark carving run by man of the match De Bruyne, while Lukebakio and Amadou Onana both blazed over. It seemed only a matter of time before they scored again, but Romania weathered the storm and, knowing how they struck so devastatingly on the counter to beat Ukraine, did not panic. Their fans certainly stayed behind them, helping create an amazing atmosphere as noise rained down from all four stands. The waves of Belgian attacks continued though, as Jeremy Doku fizzed a cross inches from Lukaku’s head, De Bruyne curled just past a post then had another shot smothered by Nita. Lukaku thought he had got the second after an hour, slotting home confidently from a De Bruyne through ball, only for VAR to rule it out for offside – five days after he had two goals chalked off against Slovakia. The incredible end-to-end action continued with Dennis Man clean through for Romania only to shoot wastefully straight at Casteels and then, incredibly, it was the Belgian keeper who set up the second 10 minutes from time with a Sunday league, route one goal. He launched a goal kick that evaded everyone and the ever-switched on De Bruyne seized on it to tuck the ball home for what could prove a priceless goal should the calculators be needed to split the teams next week. Romania, of course, are also still in the hunt to reach the knockout stage for only the second time, having failed to even qualify for the last six World Cups following their golden era of the 1990s. \"We had a great start to the tournament, now let's see how we deal with difficulty. We need solidarity and unity because we are still first in the group,\" their coach Edward Iordanescu said. \"It's a most complicated group - a third goal would have been really bad for us.\""

There were a total of 6 pitch invaders throughout the second half of the game, which eventually got the Portugal number 7 visibly frustrated because of the repeated disruptions it caused in the game. After Portugal secured a 3-0 lead on top of Ronaldo's brilliant assist to Bruno Fernandes in the 56th minute, a young fan took his shot and ran to the pitch in order to get a selfie with the 39-year-old Al Nassr forward. Ronaldo was very welcoming to the little kid and won hearts by giving him a hug and then went on to posing willingly for the picture. However, this inspired a second guy to opt for the same route within the next ten minutes, for the same purpose of getting a picture with Ronaldo. This time the forward was left visibly annoyed with the game getting interrupted and showed his frustration by removing the pitch invader's hand from around his neck and denying a picture, followed by the youngster getting carried off the field by match stewards. Much to the frustration of the crowd and Ronaldo himself, there were two more invaders during injury time and then two more after the full-time whistle.

This labour-intensive process is crucial for high-quality coffee. Credit: Getty Images After harvesting, cherries undergo processing to extract beans. This can be done using the dry method, where cherries are sun-dried, or the wet method, where they are pulped and fermented.

Here are 6 guidelines for your vehicle. Ensure proper levels of engine oil, coolant, and brake fluid to prevent overheating. Check coolant quality and quantity regularly. Tyre pressure is to be checked at regular intervals, As in Summer, high outside temperature impacts tyre pressure. Don’t overfill Air. Fill Air as per recommended tyre pressure. After parking your vehicle for a long time, open the windows and set the AC to maximum with the blower for 2 minutes to quickly evacuate hot air and cool the cabin faster. Check the fuel system for leaks or damage, especially around the lines, injector, and tank. Avoid storing flammable materials inside the cabin to prevent auto-ignition in high temperatures. Check the battery for corrosion and secure connection. Faulty batteries can cause electrical short circuits leading to fires. Avoid parking the vehicle over tall grass or dry leaves. Due to the scorching heat temperature is already high, further heat from the catalytic converter can ignite the grasses quickly."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Summer is a season that can make anyone question their entire wardrobe. If not curated thoughtfully, it can be difficult to find a single piece of clothing that looks stylish while also feeling comfortable in the unforgiving heat. To avoid encountering this dilemma, you should definitely consider investing in some linen outfits. Linen screams summer friendliness while also being a true champion of three important S’s: style, sophistication, and sustainability. Despite being a super versatile fabric to work with, linen has not been unaffected by the curse of stereotyping. A boxy shirt in striking white or a pastel shade is what mostly comes to mind when one thinks of linen clothing. Think a little beyond, and one can also think of kurtas. But linen is much more than those crisp shirts and kurtas. Apart from taking your linen essentials to a beach or a grocery outing, you can also rock linen to a summer wedding, attend a party in a sultry dress, or simply elevate your everyday style with some fashion-forward picks. Designers are leaving no stone unturned to give the humble linen a glam makeover with playful silhouettes and splashes of bold colours. Sobhita Dhulipala in a linen coord set by APZ But first things first, why is linen such a big deal in summer? The primary answer lies in its utility quotient. It is the ultimate summer fabric for how it is lightweight and breathable. “It absorbs moisture and dries quickly, keeping you cool and comfortable even in the hottest weather. Linen’s airy weave promotes ventilation, making it ideal for humid conditions,” says Udita Bansal, founder of the fashion brand trueBrowns. Additionally, it's gentle on the skin (even for those with sensitive skin prone to rashes), perfect for everyday wear. Fashion designer duo David Abraham and Rakesh Thakore of the label Abraham and Thakore also love linen for its effortless drape and touch of sophistication. Experiment with silhouettes Think beyond shirts. Go for relaxed coord sets, pantsuits, cutout dresses, wrap tops, jumpsuits, and tunics. There is a bevy of variety in the fashion world. “Linen blazer sets are the sweet spot between making a fashion statement and ensuring comfort. Linen jumpsuits are also great if you’re looking for a clean, modern silhouette,” says designer Rikita Saluja, founder of The Dramebaaz Co. Try out different silhouettes to up your linen game. (Photo credits: 1. Sand by Shirin, 2. Payal Pratap, 3. Marks and Spencer, 4. Dash and Dot, 5. Yam India, 6. Amala Earth) You can also look for outfits with asymmetrical hems and statement sleeves for an added touch of glam. Say yes to playful linen dresses (Photo credits: 1. Summer Somewhere, 2. Cord, 3. Lovebirds Studio, 4. Mango) Go bold with the colour palette Designers are playing with linen like never before. From deep burgundy to rich green and bold tangerine, the linen colour palette is not restricted to soft pastels and monochrome. Don't restrict your linen colour palette to soft pastels (Photo credits: 1. Cord, 2. Payal Khandwala, 3. Anavila, 4. Yam India) Linen saree? Yes, please Linen sarees can be your best bet for summer. They look formal but can also be styled to exude a casual or festive vibe. Designers Abraham and Thakore suggest draping a linen saree in unconventional styles to showcase its modern elegance. Linen sarees for the win (Photo credits: 1. Anavila, 2. Sonam Kapoor in Anavila, 3. Abraham and Thakore) “Pair it with a tailored blouse or experiment with contemporary blouse designs like off-shoulder or crop tops,” they say. Quirky details A bit of quirk only elevates the fashion appeal of an ensemble. Look for linen outfits with peppy prints, patches, and colour play. From embellished linen blazers to relaxed vest sets, try out quirky linen fits. (Photo credits: 1. Heirloom by Rara Avis, 2. The Space Lines, 3. Yam India, 4. The Dramebaaz Co) Headed to work? “A linen kurta pant set is perfect for the office, offering both comfort and sophistication,” says Udita. “For a relaxed yet polished summer look, a cotton linen kurta paired with matching pants strikes the right balance for formal occasions,” she adds. Linen trousers Linen trousers – be they baggy or straight-fit – are ultimate comfort companions for summer. For men: Apart from the classic solid linen shirts, you can also look for ones with added details (like embroidery, prints, or patches) that align with your style. Elevate your summer style with quirky linen shirts (Photo: Runit Gupta) Here are some more ways to wear linen, as suggested by Ravi Gupta, creative director of the menswear brand Gargee Designer's: Wearing linen can also be tricky. Just one wrong move and the whole understated elegance can go downhill. Iron it well, please: Wearing a wrinkled linen outfit can instantly kill the luxurious appeal of the fabric. So, iron or steam the garment well before wearing. However, linen is prone to wrinkle easily. Embrace the fabric's inherent wrinkles after wearing it as part of its charm. Avoid pairing with synthetic fabrics: Experts advise against mixing linen with synthetic fabrics, as it can clash with and detract from its natural look. Instead, pair linen with other natural fabrics like cotton and silk. Avoid wearing in monsoon: Designers suggest being mindful of wearing linen in excessively humid or rainy weather, as it may become prone to wrinkling and shrinkage. Avoid tight-fit clothes: Avoid wearing overly tight linen, as it can restrict airflow and defeat the fabric’s cooling properties. Happy summer!"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story When someone who smells great passes by, it's hard not to turn your head. The power of a good perfume is undeniable, especially in public settings. In recent years, beauty enthusiasts have taken their obsession with smelling good to another level by embracing hair perfumes. Many brands are now creating perfumes specifically for your hair. So, imagine having tresses that smell amazing every day! But is this product good for your hair, or could it potentially damage your lustrous locks? Let's find out what the experts have to say. \"A hair perfume is a specialised fragrance product designed specifically for use on the hair. Unlike traditional perfumes, hair perfumes are formulated to be lightweight and non-drying, often containing nourishing ingredients such as essential oils and silicones that help to add shine and reduce frizz,\" Dr Stuti Khare Shukla, Mumbai-based dermatologist, hair specialist, and founder of Elements of Aesthetics, tells India Today . Adding to this, Dr Sravya C Tipirneni, consultant dermatologist, cosmetologist, and trichologist, Manipal Hospitals, Bangalore, explains that hair perfumes are a relatively new addition to the beauty aisle and are making waves in the haircare world. \"A hair perfume adds a pleasant scent to your locks, leaving a long-lasting trail of freshness that complements your perfume. This fragrant addition to your routine can boost confidence and turn heads,\" she says. Hair perfumes are formulated to be lightweight (Photo: Getty Images) Dr Shukla shares that it is important to consider what ingredients are present in your perfume because such products may contain ethyl alcohol and heavy synthetic fragrances. She mentions that over time, such products can lead to scalp irritation, dryness, or damage to the hair shaft. \"This scepticism is based on the understanding that the scalp is an extension of the skin and therefore requires products that maintain its health and integrity and avoid unnecessary chemicals that could disrupt its natural balance,\" adds the doctor. Dr Shukla goes on to share that hair perfumes are generally not recommended due to their potential negative effects on hair health. According to Dr Tipirneni, this product falls somewhere between a social media trend and an essential. While it can be a delightful way to add a touch of luxury to your haircare routine, it is not a necessity for healthy hair. \"For those seeking a sensory experience and an extra layer of fragrance, hair perfumes offer a unique way to personalise their scent,\" the doctor states. On the other hand, Dr Shukla feels that using perfume on your hair can be seen as more of a social media trend than a basic haircare procedure. Social media platforms often popularise beauty products and routines that promise instant aesthetic benefits, and hair perfumes have become popular as a way to keep hair fresh all day. Experts feel that hair perfume is not a necessity (Photo: Getty Images) It is vital to note that this product is not considered necessary to maintain healthy hair, and the primary focus of haircare should be practices that promote the health and integrity of the hair and scalp, such as using moisturising shampoos and conditioners, avoiding excessive heat and chemical treatments, and maintaining a balanced diet. If you still wish to give in to the trend and want to buy a hair perfume, remember that while choosing the right perfume: Using hair perfume in moderation is key to avoid potential damage and maintain hair health. Always remember that using too much perfume on your hair can overwhelm the senses and lead to product build-up on your hair and scalp. A few light sprays are usually enough to achieve a pleasant fragrance without saturating the hair. \"It is best to apply perfume to the hair sparingly and focus on the mid-lengths and ends of the hair rather than the scalp to minimise any risk of irritation or product build-up,\" says Dr Shukla. The experts say that there are definitely some DIY hacks and household items that can be used as more natural alternatives to hair perfume. Dr Shukla shares, \"One effective option is to make a homemade hair mist using essential oils. You can mix a few drops of your favourite essential oils such as lavender, rosemary, or chamomile with water in a spray bottle. These oils not only provide a pleasant fragrance, but also offer various benefits for hair health, such as promoting growth and adding shine.\" \"Another simple solution is to use rose water, which has a light refreshing scent and can also help hydrate and soothe the scalp. Alternatively, you can infuse the water with a citrus peel such as a lemon or orange and leave it on for a few hours before spraying it on your hair,\" she adds. Instead of buying hair perfume, you can try DIY hacks (Photo: Getty Images) According to the doctor, these natural alternatives are free of harsh chemicals and alcohol, making them kinder to your hair and scalp while keeping your locks fresh. Meanwhile, here are a few alternatives shared by Dr Tipirneni: While hair perfumes are becoming a massive social media trend, less is definitely more with this product. A light spritz is enough and applying too much can overpower your senses and weigh down your hair. This product is a fun way to add a touch of luxury and fragrance to your haircare routine, but a healthy mane doesn't require it."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story There are many reasons why we might not want to work out: sometimes it’s the scorching heat, sometimes it’s our busy schedules, or sometimes we just don’t feel like it. However, this doesn’t mean we should ignore our health whenever we don't feel like sweating or lifting heavy weights. In such cases, taking a short walk can be very beneficial. But how exactly does walking help, and what is the ideal number of steps to take? We asked the experts. “Walking is, let's face it, the original exercise. It can be done practically anyplace, is free, and doesn't require sophisticated equipment,” says Kamala Bharadwaja, a yoga expert at Kshemavana, a luxury wellness retreat in Nelemangala, Bengaluru. A 150-minute walk per week can lower the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Photo: Unsplash Experts believe that just walking has various benefits, more so than you think. Let us look at them. Let us first look, what walking does to various parts of your body (Kate Austin, head coach at MultiFit, tells us): Heart Brain Liver Joints Apart from your internal body, there are other benefits of walking. Kamala says that walking strengthens bones, enhances balance, and helps regulate weight—all critical for maintaining an active lifestyle as one ages. She further adds that one can achieve some kind of ''mental clarity by walking''. Walking helps burn calories. Photo: Unsplash “Walking can improve mood, boost creativity, and sharpen memory because it boosts blood flow to the brain. Studies indicate that it can boost your mood and help combat stress and anxiety,” she adds. She further says that walking promotes a better quality of sleep, helping us wake up feeling refreshed and energised. Spoorthi S, a fitness expert at Cult in Bengaluru, Karnataka, adds that walking helps burn calories and doing it regularly can increase the overall caloric expenditure of the body. What is the total number of steps that you should walk every day? Is it 5K or 10K? Or a marathon? The Internet will give you all sorts of numbers, but experts like Kamala say it is important to get at least 30 minutes of brisk walking. Spoorthi also agrees and further says that even though the ideal targets depend on every individual's current activity levels and goals, “at least 30 mins of walking would be a good start for most people.” You can track your number of steps with the help of a smartwatch. Photo: Unpslash “As far as steps are concerned, studies show that an increased step count (with a minimum of 6000–8000 steps a day) results in increased mortality. But the most important thing is that you must aim to be more active than you currently are,” Spoorthi adds. We have talked about the benefits of walking, but does it mean that you can replace your strenuous workouts? Well, according to experts, for someone who is just starting off with workouts, or has been leading a sedentary lifestyle, walking can be a great start towards building a healthy lifestyle. However, both physical activities have different impacts on your body. An extensive workout regime offers benefits like muscle building. Photo: Unsplash Kate says that while an extensive workout regime offers additional benefits like muscle building and high-intensity calorie burning, walking is an excellent foundation for overall health and well-being. “Walking is accessible, low-impact, and sustainable, making it suitable for people of all ages and fitness levels. Walking is not just a simple stroll in the park—it's a powerful form of exercise with far-reaching benefits for body, mind and soul,” Kate adds."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Since childhood, we’ve heard our moms urging us to “eat your greens.” However, now that we’re a bit older, social media insist we “drink our greens”, and we wish we were joking. These green juices that have become the favourite of every other beauty and health influencer promise a few things - and some of them definitely include glass-like skin, a flat stomach, and silky hair. Sounds like one solution to all of your problems, right? India Today spoke to experts about three of the most viral green juice recipes. Should you include these ‘health drinks’ into your diet, are they really as beneficial as the social media buzz claims – read on to know it all. Chlorophyll water is a favourite drink amongst beauty influencers majorly for its effects on acne. This Chlorophyll water can be bought directly from stores or get it in the form of drops and mixed with water. Experts also agree about the effectiveness of chlorophyll. For instance, Dr Monica Bambroo, head of dermatology and cosmetology at Artemis Hospital, Gurugram, lists a few benefits of drinking chlorophyll water. A post shared by BoHoGlamHaus (@bohoglamhaus) Let us break it down for you. Rashi Tantia, the HOD of dietetics at the Metro Hospital, Faridabad, agrees and adds that chlorophyll water can be a “healthy addition to your diet” as it has antioxidant properties, which means it can help neutralise harmful free radicals in the body. She says, chlorophyll: Experts also commented that you might experience some side effects of having chlorophyll. “Chlorophyll water in large quantities may cause digestive upset, such as diarrhoea or nausea,” Rashi adds. Moreover, Rashi also adds that there are very limited studies on chlorophyll and the impacts of consuming it. If you want to become the next “It Girl,” take notes. Step 1: You need to have premium lip oil. Step 2: Get one of Van Cleef’s necklaces or bracelets (it will cost you more than your kidney) . Step 3: You need to love matcha. There is no doubt that, over time, thanks to the influence of social media, matcha has replaced the cute cups that once held hot, steaming lattes. Social media will tell you that it has a lot of benefits for your face and body and is better than your friendly, easy-to-make green tea. Matcha helps in improving your memory. Photo: Unsplash But what is it? Matcha is a powder that’s made of finely ground green tea leaves from the Camellia sinensis plant, which has its roots in Japan. But is it true? Let’s look at some of the studies. Although very limited, but a few studies done on matcha show that it does have a few benefits. For instance, a 2023 study shows that matcha not only decreases stress and anxiety, but improves memory and short- and long-term cognitive function in humans. But also remember that the studies done on matcha are very limited, and moreover, similar studies show that matcha doesn’t appear to cause significant side effects when consumed in moderation, but when consumed in large amounts, the caffeine present in matcha may cause: Both options mentioned above come with certain disadvantages, leading many people to switch to an all-natural green juice. For instance, some people dislike the taste of matcha, while others find chlorophyll water too expensive, or it is not readily available. However, one drink creating quite a buzz on social media is celery juice, which is neither earthy in taste nor too expensive. In case you don't know, celery is a fairly well-known vegetable in the Indian market, scientifically known as 'Apium graveolens '. Celery juice is scientifically known as 'Apium graveolens'. Photo: Unsplash Claimed benefits? A post shared by Thegreenchick Restaurant & Juice Bar (@thegreenchick) Rashi Tania tells India Today that celery juice has \"possible health advantages\", especially for the skin. \"It is recommended to drink celery juice in the morning on an empty stomach. It is mainly water, so drinking celery juice will help keep your skin moisturised, which is necessary for a healthy shine. It contains vitamins A, C, and K, which are essential for skin health\", says Rashi. Celery juice is known for its high water content and anti-inflammatory properties. Photo: Pexels Dr Bambroo further says, that just like celery juice, other green juices, like kale or spinach juice, are also rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which can contribute to better skin health. \"Celery juice is known for its high water content and anti-inflammatory properties, which can aid in reducing skin inflammation and promoting a clear complexion,\" says Dr Bambroo. 'Green' does not always equate to healthy . Dr Bambroo says that even though these \"green juices\" are healthy for us, we shouldn't rely solely on these juices without a balanced diet (so don't think of going on a juice cleanse, it won't help you) . \"It may not yield long-term benefits,\" she adds. Moreover, we need more scientific studies to prove that these drinks can aid in weight loss and help us achieve glass-like skin."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In the quest to achieve flawless and youthful skin, beauty enthusiasts are willing to try anything. From getting vampire facials done to slathering their faces with snail mucin, we have seen them do some bizarre things in the name of beauty on social media. The latest obsession? Salmon sperm facials. This trend has skyrocketed in popularity since Hollywood star Jennifer Aniston admitted to trying it. While enjoying a delicious salmon dish is one thing, getting a salmon sperm facial is a whole new level of craziness. \"Salmon sperm? Sounds gross, right? But the actual ingredient is not how it sounds. It is a popular K-beauty trend due to its anti-ageing skin benefits. What's used is polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN), a term derived for purified molecules found in the DNA of salmon fish. This is injected into the face to improve the skin complexion, repair damaged cells, boost hyaluronic acid levels, and make your skin look dewy,\" Delhi-based dermatologist Dr Rinky Kapoor from The Esthetic Clinics tells India Today . A post shared by Dr Paul Elgey ðèðûââï¸ Aesthetic Doctor (@drpaulelgey) Further, Dr Shifa Yadav, consultant, dermatology and cosmetology, Artemis Hospital, Gurugram, explains that polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN), an active mixture of polynucleotides with a molecular weight ranging from 50 to 1500 kDa, is mainly extracted and purified from the sperm cells of salmon trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) or chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta). According to Dr Kapoor, this Korean beauty trend involves applying DNA extracted from salmon sperm onto the face to enhance your facial features. \"Injectables are more effective and yield faster and longer long-term results,\" adds Dr Yadav. Salmon sperm performs better when injected into the skin (Photo: Getty Images) The doctor also explains how the salmon sperm facial is different from fillers. She says, \"Fillers are hyaluronic-based injections and physically plump the skin. Polynucleotide acts as a bio-stimulant, boosting the body's fibroblast cells and therefore collagen and elastin levels without adding any extra volume.\" \"Some people claim that this facial has anti-ageing properties which can make the skin look young and supple. The DNA from salmon sperm is believed to improve collagen production , which can help reduce the signs of ageing such as wrinkles and fine lines,\" mentions Dr Kapoor. She adds, \"It also promotes the growth of new skin cells, achieving that fresh look. However, there is not enough evidence or research to prove the effectiveness and benefits of this K-beauty trend.\" Meanwhile, Dr Yadav goes on to share some more benefits/clinical effects of polynucleotide: Experts tell us that those who undergo a salmon sperm facial may experience various skin allergies and side-effects on their skin. Dr Yadav says that almost anyone who is looking to improve skin quality, laxity, and wrinkles can go for a salmon sperm facial as it gives a very natural result and is very safe without any downtime. \"It is very good for under-eye dark circles and the result is visible just after a single session. It works wonderfully for dull and dehydrated skin, giving a very subtle natural glow to the skin,\" the doctor adds. As per the expert, usually three sessions are recommended and results last for 6-8 months. While this treatment can give you naturally glowing skin with fewer wrinkles and lines, it cannot help you achieve a lifted look as it's not a filler, nor does it fill up any volume deficiency on the face. This treatment is good for dull and dehydrated skin (Photo: Getty Images) \"Salmon sperm facial is slowly gaining popularity in India also because of its quick and natural results,\" states Dr Yadav. On the other hand, Dr Kapoor says that beauty enthusiasts in India do not experiment much when it comes to their skin and try to choose safer and more effective options. However, it is important to note that although PDRN has numerous therapeutic properties, further research is required to identify more cost-effective extraction methods and maximise its use in the cosmetic industry. Before getting a salmon sperm facial, it is important to consult your cosmetologist and understand the potential benefits and side effects of the treatment. There are various other facials or beauty treatments available that are safer and more effective than the salmon sperm facial. These are Vitamin C facials, collagen facials, and hyaluronic facials. Maintaining a proper skincare routine can also give you similar results."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Fashion trends are cyclical. They make a remarkable entry and then disappear in vain, only to make a major comeback years (or decades) later. Currently, the fashion world is witnessing the resurgence of some classic 90s fashion trends, making millennials feel quite old for living through a complete fashion cycle. The runways, celebrity sartorial choices, and Gen Z are all in unison to bring them back. Here are the 5 biggest trends from the '90s that you must embrace in 2024 (even if your millennial heart rejects them). PS: If you are someone who grew up hating those knee-length school socks and rolling them to the ankles, a shocker awaits below. Read on... Capris, cropped pants, or peddle pushers - call them by any name – but the fact to admit is that they are back in vogue. The controversial trousers that ruled the fashion scene in the 90s and even 00s are here as a major summer-spring trend again. Fashion’s favourite sisters Bella Hadid and Gigi Hadid are leading the return of capris. And if you thought, capris are only meant for casual grocery sprees or lazy noons spent at home, you are getting it all wrong. Bella Hadid rocks a capri for a day out. (Photo: Getty Images) Take a cue from Gigi Hadid who gave a pair of denim capris a rather fancy twist with a touch of gold. She styled her denim capris with a black tank top (another raging trend from the 90s) with a pair of black stilettos and some chunky golden jewels. Gigi Hadid's take on the 90s capri is rather stylish. (Photo: Getty Images) This comeback has also been prevalent on the runways this year, with brands like Coperni and 16Arlington showcasing them in their new collections. A model walks the ramp for 16Arlington (Photo: Getty Images) If you grew up in the 90s, you would know how slip dresses were quite a rage. The figure-hugging sleeveless dresses cut a sultry picture. Cut to 2024, they are back but sans the lacy details. Slip dresses are here to rule the fashion scene (Photo: Getty Images) A 2024’s slip dress is bold and edgy. Think sharp side-slits, plunging necklines, structured bodice, and a bright colour palette that goes beyond the classic black and white. Tripti Dimri in a red slip dress. (Photo: Instagram/Tripti_Dimri) The versatility of a classic slip dress, however, is unmatched. Team it with a pair of loafers, and you are ready for work. For a fun night out, put on your party heels and style it with some glitzy jewellery pieces. In sync with this is also the revival of camisole straps, spaghetti straps and tank tops. Kareena Kapoor in a camisole top (Photo: Yogen Shah) and Irina Shayk in a tank top (Instagram) From Chanel to Gucci, the biggest fashion shows of the year screamed a major return of ballet flats. Pointed flat shoes, inspired from the ballerinas worn by ballet dancers, were immensely popular in the 90s. They have tiptoed their way to the fashion radar once again. But the range to choose from is much wider this time –like lustrous latex pairs in black and maroon, or those accentuated with strap details. A model walks the ramp for Gucci show. (Photo: Instagram/Gucci) Beyond the classics, a major sub-trend to have emerged in the realm of ballet flats are the ones with mesh details. Just one glance at the new collections of brands like Miu Miu, Magda Butrym and The Row, you will agree as well. Red mesh ballets from Alaia By the way, Taylor Swift has heartily embraced this fashion return as well! A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) No more hiding your socks, but totally flaunting them and making them a significant part of your outfit is the fashion mantra of the moment. A horror for millennials? Probably. Millennials, who grew up hating their long school socks have dearly loved their no-show ankle-length socks. But guess what, Gen Z has brought long socks back in a rather stylish way. Socks, like other aspects of a look, are supposed to make an impact on the outfit. Malvika Sheth styled her Louis Vuitton dress with long white socks. (Photo: Getty Images) Remember, how wearing socks with Birkenstocks was 2023’s coolest trend? We mean, it still is, but it has further upgraded to also being flaunted with heels, crocs and regular shoes as well. Whether it is a summer dress, a blazer and shorts set, a skirt or your wide-legged denims, let that cool pair of socks show. PS: It doesn’t have to be quirky! It can also complement the base colour of a simple outfit. A dark lip liner with a lighter shade of lipstick topped with a high-shine gloss is classic 90s aesthetic. In 2024, it is cool be sporting it. The liner not only gives an edge but also makes your lip the highlight of your beauty game. From Rihanna to Janhvi Kapoor, everyone is up for it too. Rihanna roots for lined lips. (Photo: Instagram/badgalriri) Pro tip: Swap that sticky lip gloss for a nourishing lip oil that nourishes your lips while also providing a high shine."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Picture this: You are taking a warm shower and rinsing your hair when suddenly you see...your hair strands falling as you wash down your hair with your favourite shampoo. Sounds like an everyday story, right? If you’re here, chances are that you might have faced this nightmare IRL, that too, time and again. Hair loss is a common problem that many of us face. A Harvard study shows that we normally lose approximately 50 to 100 scalp hair each day, so you don’t need to worry about a little hairfall now and then. Various factors can cause excessive hair loss. Photo: Unsplash However, the problem arises if our hair falls increases more than that number. According to this study, here are some ways you can figure out if you are suffering from excessive hairfall: Experts say that there can be various other reasons as well. “Hair loss can be caused by a multitude of factors, and hard water is just one piece of the puzzle,” Dr Sravya C Tipirneni, a consultant dermatologist, cosmetologist and trichologist at Manipal Hospital, Bangalore tells us. Here's a breakdown of some common ‘culprits’ of hairball: Your genetics Out of all the reasons that lead to hairfall, according to Dr Tipirneni, hereditary factor is a leading cause. “Unfortunately, there's not much you can do about your genes,\" she says. Stress can also trigger hairfall. Photo: Getty Images Hormonal changes Pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, and even thyroid issues can disrupt hair growth cycles and lead to temporary or permanent hair loss. Stress One of the most overlooked, underestimated factors that causes hairfall is stress which can trigger hair shedding. For instance, studies show that your stress can cause three types of hairfall (yes, there are different types of hairfall): Tight hairstyle According to Dr Tipirneni, tight hairstyles that pull on the scalp or harsh chemical treatments can damage hair follicles and lead to breakage. The Vitamin D3 levels in your body also impact your hair. Shailesh tells us that since Vitamin D3 helps in our hair growth, its deficiency may cause hairfall. Vitamin D levels of 30 to 100 ng/mL are considered optimal. Photo: Unsplash Dr Tipirneni says, “While research is ongoing, maintaining healthy D3 levels through sunlight exposure or supplements might be beneficial. However, it's important to consult a doctor before taking any supplements.\" She also says that other deficiencies like iron, protein and biotin can also contribute to hair loss. Experts suggest there are various ways you can combat hairfall. Here are some: If you have been facing excessive hairfall for quite a while, the first step is to ensure the shampoo you use works for you. For instance, sulfate-free formulas work best, as they cleanse without stripping your natural hair oil if you have low porous hair. Dr Tipirneni suggests using a clarifying shampoo (a deep cleanser) to remove mineral build-up from hard water. Now, for porous hair use shampoos with hydrating and nourishing properties. Dr Tipirneni recommends that a diluted apple cider vinegar rinse can help restore your hair's natural pH balance, eventually helping with hairfall. Minoxidil can be applied as a topical solution or foam on your scalp to promote hair growth. Photo: Getty Images Now, if you have hard water in the city, you can consider a shower filter to soften the water. A post shared by MAHAZ | Hair & Scalpcare | Trichology (@mahaz_hair) Several hair serums claim to stop hair loss. Look for serums containing ingredients like minoxidil that have shown some promise in promoting hair growth. Hair loss doesn’t have to be permanent. If you are consistent with your hair care and address the underlying cause of hair loss, you can get visible results."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story This outfit looks great on me; let me take a photo and share it on Instagram. This book seems fascinating; I'll tweet about it. This moment with my partner is so precious; I'll post it on Facebook. Don't we all do this whenever something noteworthy happens? We have this immediate urge to share every moment of our lives on social media. Whether we are on vacation or enjoying a romantic date, we embrace the mantra of sharing or, perhaps more accurately, flaunting. But have you ever considered how much sharing is too much and when to draw the line? \"In today's digital age, sharing personal life on social media has become a norm due to the desire for connection, validation, and self-expression. People often seek likes, comments, and shares as a form of social approval, which can boost self-esteem and create a sense of belonging,\" Dr Gorav Gupta, Gurugram-based psychiatrist and co-founder of Emoneeds (a mental health start-up), tells India Today . Agreeing with this, Dr Sarthak Dave, an Ahmedabad-based psychiatrist, adds that this also gives people a sense of belonging. He says, \"Sharing online helps them feel noticed and valued, especially if they don't get that recognition in their 'offline' lives. And let's be honest, who doesn't enjoy some applause for their latest success or adorable pet picture?\" Meanwhile, Dr Mazher Ali, consultant psychiatrist, CARE Hospitals, Hyderabad, shares that with social-media influencing becoming a popular career path recently, a lot of people indulge in its obsessive use. \"There should be a clear boundary of posting only 20 per cent to 30 per cent of your personal lives on social media,\" he adds. Dr Dave feels that it's important to keep a balance. \"Think of social media like seasoning – a little bit makes things better, but too much can ruin it,\" he said. The doctor says that you can share important moments, like a promotion or a fun trip, but not every meal or workout needs to be posted. Often, less is more, and keeping some things private can be more appealing. Even Dr Ali thinks that drawing a line is important. He mentions, \"In today's generation, information is power and can be misused very easily. Posting personal or sensitive information on social media allows others easy access to target you. Draw a line, especially when it involves content that should be private or involves the privacy of others – such as children.\" As per the doctor, you should not shy away from seeking professional help if you feel you are not able to stop compulsively posting about your personal life. You don't have to share every detail of your personal life on social media (Photo: Getty Images) Further, Dr Gupta says, \"Drawing the line involves setting personal boundaries and regularly assessing the impact of social media on your mental health. If sharing begins to feel obligatory or stressful, it's time to re-evaluate. Prioritise face-to-face interactions and offline experiences to maintain a healthy balance.\" You should completely stop posting your personal life on social media when: If your habit of posting online turns into an obsession, try uninstalling the application for a week and observe how you feel. Use that time for activities offline, like reading, taking walks, or meeting friends in person. If you notice your mood improving, it could be a signal to extend your break or reduce your social media use in the long term. How many times have you pretended things on social media? We have all done that. But doing so can impact your mental health. \"Sometimes people are deprived of attention, validation, quality time from their loved ones. Hence, they pretend to fit in, gain admiration, or impress others on social media. It’s like wearing a mask – it might seem helpful, but it’s exhausting. Over time, this can lead to feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and even depression. Keeping up a facade is hard work, and it can take a serious toll on your mental health,\" says Dr Dave. Obsession with social media can impact your mental health (Photo: Getty Images) Dr Ali goes on to share, \"Social media can lead to escapism and may damage your relationships with real people, leading to loneliness, severe anxiety, or depression. Typically, social media addiction is followed by isolation and obsessive behaviour. Often, an excessive need for validation is displayed, and a person may begin to experience impostor syndrome or the irrational fear of being exposed or revealed as a fraud.\""

You might be surprised to learn that the actor starts his day with a scrumptious serving of kanji , which is fermented rice eaten with curd, sliced chillies, and onion. But it’s loaded with probiotics, which are great for the gut, and also has a cooling effect on the body. That’s exactly what you need from the first meal of the day as the mercury rises. While chhole bhature and poori sabji make our taste buds do a happy dance, these, by no means, make for a healthy summer breakfast. India being the land of diverse cuisines has some interesting options that not only take care of the nutrition quotient but also keep the body cool. Sweedal Trinidade, chief dietician at PD Hinduja Hospital and MRC in Mahim, Mumbai, says, “Breakfast is the most important meal of the day as it is consumed after an overnight fast to recharge and energise us for the day ahead. Considering the thermic effect (the amount of energy it takes for your body to digest, absorb, and metabolise the food you eat) of food, metabolic rate, and the demand for fluid-electrolyte replacement, it is best to opt for lighter meals, ones that include fermented foods and are rich in protein.” With the country reeling under a severe heatwave, it is all the more important to choose a breakfast option that doesn't make it more difficult for us to get through the day. Each of these dishes mentioned below has its own unique flair and benefits and is perfect for those severely hot mornings. Dahi chura/Doi chire (East India): Dahi chura, doi chire, or dahi chiwda—it’s the same dish. This staple summer breakfast eaten in the East Indian states of Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal, and Assam (North-East) consists of flattened rice which is served with a generous helping of curd, topped with sugar or jaggery to sweeten it. It's cooling, probiotic-rich meal that keeps the tummy happy and your energy levels up. A post shared by Piu's kitchen (@susmitapiu5) Dr Siddhant Bhargava, fitness and nutritional scientist and co-founder of Food Darzee, says, “The combination is quick to prepare, keeps you full, and is also easy to digest. Yogurt keeps you hydrated, helps maintain your digestive health, and boosts immunity. It also has cooling properties and is packed with essential nutrients including calcium, vitamin D, Vitamin B12, phosphorus, and potassium, which makes this combination an ideal summer breakfast.” Rice kanji: Head South, and you'll find people relishing rice kanji, a staple in many South Indian households. It's essentially fermented rice water, often spiced up with a bit of salt, curd, and maybe some chopped green chillies. This probiotic-rich breakfast helps with digestion and keeps you hydrated (and as we told you, it is also Madhavan's go-to breakfast). Not just down South, the dish is also enjoyed in West Bengal where it is called panta bhat. While Assam calls it poitabhat, it is pakhala bhat for Odias. Pakhala bhat. (Photo: Ananya Sundaray) The condiments keep changing from region to region but the base remains the same—fermented rice. It is a staple summer dish in Bangladesh as well. (You probably remember how a Masterchef contestant, Kishwar Chowdhury, prepared panta bhat for the Grand Finale of Masterchef Australia.) A post shared by MasterChef Australia (@masterchefau) Kanika Malhotra, clinical dietician and diabetes educator, mentions that consuming rice kanji for breakfast can improve digestion, boost immunity, enhance nutrition absorption, hydrate the body, and help with weight management. Idli sambhar: A classic from Tamil Nadu, idli sambhar needs no introduction . It's light, nutritious, and packs a punch of protein and vitamins, making it a balanced breakfast to kickstart your day. Chakuli pitha: From Odisha, we have chakuli pitha, which is akin to a dosa but a bit thicker and softer. Made from fermented rice and urad dal batter, it's usually served with a tangy tomato chutney or a simple potato curry. It's light yet filling, perfect for keeping you active without feeling weighed down. Poha: A popular choice in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, poha is flattened rice cooked with onions, turmeric, mustard seeds, and green chillies. Toss in some peanuts and a splash of lemon juice, and you've got a tasty, light breakfast that's easy on the stomach and packed with flavour. Poha is made with flattened rice. (Photo: Unsplash) Sattu sherbet: Coming from the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, sattu sherbet is a powerhouse of nutrition . Sattu, made from roasted gram flour, is mixed with water, salt, lemon juice, and sometimes jaggery. Some even like to add flavour by adding diced onion, chillies, and a mix of roasted spices. It's a natural coolant, high in protein and fibre, perfect for rehydrating and energising you in the heat. The proverb – “Eat your breakfast like a king...” – is often mistaken, and people end up loading themselves up mindlessly. Irrespective of what the weather is like, you have to take care of what you consume. Of course, due to the rising temperatures, special considerations should be taken during this time. Avoid oily, spicy, greasy, or processed foods because they take longer to digest and have a higher thermic effect, making one feel relatively hot. Avoid eating fried and greasy food during summer. (Photo: Unsplash) So, processed meats like sausages, salami are a big no-no during summer mornings. Give luchi torkari and medu vada a miss, at least till the summer lasts. \"A healthy summer breakfast is one that keeps you cool, full, and prevents sluggishness,\" says Dr Siddhant. You don't have to be the traditional summer breakfasts if they don’t appeal to you. You can create your own meal that caters to your body’s needs. “It’s also a good idea to include fermented foods in your morning routine, to build up your good gut bacteria and maintain your energy levels. Try eating some yogurt with fruit or replacing regular bread with sourdough, for instance,” he adds. He suggests breakfast options like: “Avoid processed and sugary cereal and white bread in general, and very hot or spicy food for breakfast as the latter can cause heartburn and indigestion,” he further mentions. People in North India should consider giving up their eternal love for parathas, at least until the heatwave is over, suggests Dr Siddhant. \"Parathas are a popular Delhi breakfast, but during this time when temperatures are soaring, a lighter toasted roti stuffed with sattu can be delicious, healthy, and cooling for the body.\" \"Basic chapati sabzi seasoned with fresh herbs still remains the best choice,\" adds Sweedal. Chhole bhature is a big no-no, but its accompaniments—chaas and raita—should be part of your breakfast to help cool your body. Eggs are a good source of protein, so they can definitely be a part of your morning meal. Just make sure they are not inside your paratha."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Hair troubles? Who doesn't want to get rid of them? From using deep conditioning shampoos and applying serums to using hair SPF and dedicating Sundays to champis, we go great lengths to protect our lengths. The Internet, meanwhile, is abuzz with another at-home remedy to deal with hair loss: applying tretinoin. A post shared by Shivani Mudhamðç¿âè (@ifeelfashionn) If you are a skincare enthusiast, you would know of tretinoin as a game changer for acne . Tretinoin is a Vitamin A derivative and a type of retinoid that is primarily advised to treat acne. It is known to have numerous benefits for the skin, like: Dermatologists suggest cautiously applying tretinoin on acne-affected area and comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) at night, as it can make your skin sun-sensitive and lead to redness, burning and mild peeling. Certainly a game-changer for skin-related woes, but can it also help with hair growth? Here’s what experts want you to know about tretinoin for hair growth: “There are some characteristics of Tretinoin that make sense to work for hair growth – but more research is needed to understand how different retinoids (such as tretinoin) really work for hair growth,” says Dr Kiran, MD, founder of Isya Aesthetics in New Delhi and author of Skin Sense. Tretinoin cream Dr Geetika Srivastava, dermatologist and founder of Influennz Skin and Hair Clinic, Delhi, who doesn’t recommend tretinoin for hair growth in her clinical practice, says it might promote hair growth for how it generally functions. It promotes collagen production, which further improves the healing process of the body. “When there is healing, there is blood vessel formation. So, cellular proliferation (increase in number of cells) and angiogenesis (growth of blood vessels from the existing vasculatures) the possible explanation of how tretinoin can work for hair growth,” she adds. Dr Kiran acknowledges some evidence that suggests tretinoin may aid in hair growth: “These effects can stimulate dormant hair follicles and promote new hair growth. Clinical evidence on tretinoin alone for hair is limited,” says Dr Chytra V Anand, celebrity cosmetic dermatologist and founder, CEO of clinic Kosmoderma. Some studies have shown that tretinoin can help with hair growth, especially when used in combination with minoxidil. “Clinical evidence on tretinoin alone for hair is limited,” adds Dr Anand. “While oral minoxidil is used to treat high blood pressure by dilating the arteries, applying it topically to the scalp can increase blood flow and stimulate hair growth. However, minoxidil is not effective for everyone because it doesn't directly promote new hair growth. Instead, it creates a favourable environment for hair growth, which may not be sufficient for all individuals. This is why adding tretinoin to this treatment is where the benefits can show up,” explains Dr Kiran. But hey, this doesn’t mean you mix the two and start applying on your hair or scalp. Or, even tretinoin alone, for that matter. To counter hair loss, it is important to understand the major triggers. It could be your city’s hard water , lifestyle, vitamin deficiencies, stress, hormonal changes or usage of any particular product causing it. Though some characteristics of tretinoin suggest it may aid in hair growth, experts add that there is not much research to prove tretinoin’s efficacy to be recommended as a primary treatment for hair growth. Furthermore, it can have several side effects. A post shared by Dhaval G. Bhanusali, MD FAAD (@drbhanusali) “Excess use of tretinoin can lead to similar side effects that people witness on their face. It includes local irritation, itching, scaling, and erythema,” says Dr Geetika. It is important to speak to a dermatologist so that they can tell you how to use it, and how much – and if it is a viable option for you. “If you’re suffering from hair loss, depending on the cause of this hair loss, this might not work for you at all. So, manage your expectations accordingly. It’s best to use it under supervision because concentrated Tretinoin can lead to side effects. It also increases the skin's sensitivity to sunlight, so sun protection is essential, and your dermatologist can help you with this,” says Dr Kiran. Here is a quick guide from the experts if you plan to start using tretinoin for hair: Seeking advice from a dermatologist would be better than directly jumping on this Instagram fad."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Whether you're a minimalist who swears by a single moisturiser or a dedicated skincare enthusiast with an elaborate routine, taking care of your skin is essential. If you're unsure where to start, just hop onto any social media platform, and you will find many influencers to give you skincare gyaan . The beauty industry is constantly evolving, bringing global trends to the forefront. One day, a revolutionary 7-step skincare routine might be all the rage, only to be overshadowed the next by a comprehensive 10-step Korean regimen. Meanwhile, some experts advocate just a simple cleansing, toning, and moisturising (CTM) routine. Choosing the right skincare routine and determining how many steps it should include can be daunting. But don't worry, experts are here to guide you through the process. But first, understand... \"Skin acts as a barrier against the harmful toxins present in the environment such as chemicals, pollutants, bacteria, and damaging UV rays. This is why it is important to incorporate skincare into your daily routine to nourish your skin,\" Dr Rinky Kapoor, a Delhi-based dermatologist from The Esthetic Clinics, tells India Today . Adding to this, Dr Ruby Sachdev, consultant aesthetic physician, Gleneagles Hospital, Bengaluru, says that a good skincare regimen can enhance your overall appearance, boosting confidence and self-esteem. A proper routine can help eliminate your skincare woes (Photo: Pexels/Cottonbro Studio) Dr Akanksha Singh Cornuit, Bengaluru-based aesthetic physician and founder of Promed Aesthetics, believes that the necessity of an extensive skincare routine depends on individual skin needs and preferences. While some people might benefit from a multi-step routine, it's not essential for everyone. Meanwhile, Dr Kapoor mentions that several factors contribute to the popularity of extensive skincare routines, such as the increasing influence of K-beauty and people starting to prioritise their skin health. \"It doesn't matter how extensive your routine is; what matters the most is that it addresses all the skin problems with the correct skincare products that work effectively on your skin. Doing an extensive skincare routine daily can be time-consuming and may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with busy schedules,\" she adds. More steps mean more products, which can be expensive and might burn a hole in your pocket. According to Dr Sachdev, basic moisturisation is a critical component of skincare and can be sufficient for many individuals, especially those with normal to healthy skin. Dr Cornuit agrees and says, \"If someone has specific skin concerns such as acne , hyperpigmentation, or signs of ageing, a more tailored routine may be needed to address these issues effectively. Relying solely on moisturiser may not provide the necessary active ingredients to treat these conditions.\" Minimal skincare routine may lack essential steps (Photo: Pexels/Katrin Bolovtsova) Experts feel that the ideal number of steps in a skincare routine varies depending on individual needs, skin type, concerns, and lifestyle. You can classify skincare routines into three categories: Minimalistic routine (3-4 steps) Intermediate routine (5-6 steps) Advanced Routine (7+ steps) Further, experts mention that your morning and evening skincare routines should not be identical because they serve different purposes and address varying skin needs at different times of the day. Morning routine : The focus of this routine is on protecting the skin from environmental aggressors like UV rays, pollution, and free radicals. It typically includes cleansing, moisturising, and applying sunscreen. Additional products may include antioxidants like Vitamin C to combat oxidative stress. Evening routine : Emphasises repairing and rejuvenating the skin after exposure to harmful elements throughout the day. It often involves cleansing to remove makeup, sunscreen, and impurities, followed by treatments that promote skin repair, such as retinoids, peptides, and hydrating serums. Your morning and evening skincare routine should not be the same (Photo: Pexels/Cottonbro Studio) Cleansing, moisturising, and SPF should be sufficient. Toners and spot treatments can also be added to the routine. Using a gentle cleanser daily can help eliminate the impurities and dirt from your skin. It is advised to regularly use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or more for better coverage and protection from harmful UV rays. Your ideal skincare routine in your 20s should include a cleanser, moisturiser, sunscreen, toner, and exfoliation once a week. Incorporating skincare products that contain retinoids or peptides can help boost collagen production and reduce the appearance of ageing signs. In your 30s, your skincare routine should contain products like hydrating cleansers to maintain moisture, moisturisers to fight against skin dryness, serum with peptide or retinoid for anti-ageing treatment, and sunscreen. You should incorporate a skincare regime that includes a cleanser, exfoliation, serum, toner, under-eye cream, moisturiser, and SPF. The key to achieving effective results is to be consistent with your skincare routine and use the right products to address specific skin concerns."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Ever fantasised about spicing things up in the bedroom with some roleplay, but you are scared that your acting skills are more Uday Chopra than Shah Rukh Khan? Don’t worry, you’re not alone. There's expert guidance at hand to teach you how to master the art of bedroom theatrics, even if your acting makes Salman Khan's shirt-ripping scenes look subtle. You can still keep things spicy. Promise, no National Award required. Do you know why it is called roleplay and not acting? The skill of acting isn't what's important here; it's about the dynamic between the partners and the individuals involved in the experience. Shreya Kaul, counselling psychologist, says that this is the first thing to be kept in mind and perhaps “it will give you more confidence in your intimacy”. “There’s a common misunderstanding that you need to act a certain way when role-playing, possibly brought on by consuming pornography. In porn, people act things out with a script, but this isn't the same thing. This is about partners deciding to experience something new sexually. They involve themselves in particular setups or characters they’ve decided upon and elaborate on them,” she says. It's less about acting but more about understanding the dynamics during roleplay. (Photo: Getty Images) “The ‘play’ aspect is what’s more important. It’s about the moment and the experience,” she adds. Also, it is important to be honest, not just with yourself but with your partner as well to avoid building false expectations. Dr Sanjay Kumawat, consultant psychiatrist and sexologist, Fortis Hospital Mulund, Mumbai, says, \"Be forthright and honest. Avoid patterns you can’t maintain.\" “Starting with a known scenario cuts down on prep, so you can get right down to business,” US-based sex therapist Vanessa Marin tells Cosmopolitan (May-June 2024 edition). Don’t be over-ambitious if you are just starting off and not confident about your skills, and stick to roles from real life or what seems to be easy. If that doesn’t work, act it out in advance to see if you can get into the skin (no pun intended) of your character. Shreya says open discussions help in this case. Discussions help, so you can always talk about what you want. (Photo: Unsplash) “Discussing what you are okay with, understanding likes and dislikes, safe words, what you might enjoy, and what you may not, can be an icebreaker. You can discuss props or costumes and build up scenarios to explore together,” she adds. The emphasis isn't entirely on the act itself, but on keeping the momentum going. How would you do that? “You don't need to write a script with exact lines, but having a basic idea of the scene's trajectory can be really helpful. This way, there's less room for improvisation, and you won't be stuck wondering what to do next. Think of it as having a map: first, this happens, then this, and eventually we get to that point,” she suggests. Vanessa agrees, “No need to write a legit screenplay, but agreeing on a few basic cues can help with nerves and logistics.” Defining the roles and knowing the character traits is key. Is your character going to be shy, cheeky, or mischievous? Maybe you are a bit aggressive but not violent. What kind of language will you use? Are you going to be derogatory or respectful? Figuring this out ahead of time means you're not constantly thinking about how to act. “Additionally, it's important to discuss what you both want to explore through the role play. Having clarity about your goals and what's attractive to you about the scenario can make a big difference. The more clarity you have before starting, the less you'll worry about how to act at the moment,” says Shreya. “Roleplaying is about having fun in the bedroom and reconnecting with your partner. So, if somebody says something that’s totally out of character, you can just giggle about it and then jump back into the scene with each other,” says Vanessa. It is not the time to act all serious and remain rigid. You should go out there, put your best creative foot forward, and see the magic happen. Remember to be open with your partner, because let’s be honest, you can’t show the best of your abilities when you are awkward or low on confidence. Let your imagination and creativity lead the way, and leave the rest to the moment."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Kudos to those who embrace their natural body and facial hair! However, many prefer to remove it for comfort or to enhance their appearance. Choosing the right method for hair removal is crucial, as each technique has its pros and cons. While waxing is often painful, shaving leads to quick re-growth, and we all have considered the idea of getting laser hair removal done. To help you decide the best way to get rid of unwanted hair, India Today got in touch with a few experts for a comprehensive guide on various hair removal methods. \"Waxing is a popular hair removal method that involves applying a sticky substance to the skin, which adheres to the hair. When the wax is removed, it pulls the hair out from the root, resulting in longer-lasting smoothness,\" says Dr Rishabh Raj Sharma, dermatologist at Noida International Institute of Medical Sciences (NIIMS). There are two types of wax used in this process: soft wax, also known as strip wax, which is removed with a cloth or paper strip, and hard wax, which hardens on the skin and is removed without strips. Pros Cons Shaving is one of the most common and straightforward methods of hair removal , involving the use of a razor to cut hair on the skin's surface. \"It acts as a form of physical exfoliation, effectively sloughing off dead skin cells and leaving the skin feeling smoother, although it can cause irritation if the skin is sensitive or if shaving techniques are not carefully followed,\" explains Dr Sharma. Pros Cons This process works by targeting the hair follicles with concentrated beams of light, effectively damaging them to inhibit future hair growth. During the procedure, a dermatologist or trained technician uses a laser device that emits light absorbed by the pigment (melanin) in the hair. This light energy converts to heat, which damages the hair follicle while sparing the surrounding skin. Experts feel that laser hair removal is most effective on individuals with darker hair and lighter skin, as the contrast allows the laser to target the hair more precisely without affecting the skin. Pros Cons Dr Simantini R Sakhardand, dermatologist and cosmetologist at Manipal Hospital, Goa, shares that just like waxing, epilation involves pulling the hair out from the root using various methods like epilator, plucking, and threading. While it offers longer-lasting results compared to shaving, epilation can be uncomfortable, especially during the initial sessions or for those with sensitive skin. Pros Cons Dr Lall explains that hair removal creams and powders dissolve the hair. \"They've got enzymes that help in dissolving the hair shaft. So, unlike a shaving process, where you cut off the hair, you're just dissolving the hair shaft. It becomes a creamy thing, and then you just wipe it off,\" she says. Similar to shaving, this process also removes the hair from the skin's surface and not the roots. Further, Dr Sharma states, \"These products contain active ingredients such as calcium thioglycolate or potassium thioglycolate, which penetrate the hair follicle and dissolve the keratin bonds within the hair shaft.\" Pros Cons \"The best method for hair removal varies for each individual based on factors like hair type, skin sensitivity, and personal preferences. Laser hair removal offers long-term results, while waxing and epilation provide longer-lasting results compared to shaving. It's essential to choose a method that suits your needs and comfort level,\" says Dr Sharma. On the other hand, Dr Sakhardand suggests, \"The best method for hair removal is laser hair treatment reduction as it is a permanent method and causes fewer side effects. However, it is recommended to get it done by an expert.\" As for Dr Lall, if the hair is too visible, a person should go for laser hair reduction because the cycle of other temporary methods is never-ending."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story When Divya Giri, a 25-year-old content writer from Gurugram, clicked the share button on her Instagram, she never imagined that what began as an experiment and a joke would ultimately leave her feeling ‘heartbroken’. “I posted that reel after seeing something similar happening in Japan. Since I didn't have a website, I decided to post it on my Instagram,” says Divya. According to her, the motive behind asking for money to go on a date was driven by three reasons, none of which were about money. What are the three reasons? We’ll get to that in a bit, but first, let us tell you more about this ‘viral’ reel. Instagram’s algorithm is always mysterious, and what goes viral can be beyond our understanding ( sometimes ). However, several factors like relatability and shareability can contribute to its popularity. Sometimes, a reel not only makes you laugh but also makes headlines. One such viral reel that recently not only made headlines but amazed a lot of people was where \"a girl offered to go on a date for money.\" “Rent me on a date and let’s create some amazing memories together,” says the Instagram reel. This date, according to the reel, does come with a price (quite literally). Now, if you are wondering what these prices were and the date experiences? Here’s what the reel says: You can also have “add-ons” for your date, which have experiences like: Check out the reel here: A post shared by Divya Giri (@divya_giri__) Divya’s reel not only went viral but also created quite a buzz. The video now has over 9.1 million views and more than 10,000 comments. Have a look at some of them (we have picked a few ‘decent’ ones): Now, as absurd as the idea of renting oneself out sounds, so does the idea of name-calling and being mean to someone you have never known in the comments section. But what made Divya post about this in the first place? Here's what she tells us. \"I came across this renting trend in Japan, where you can rent a boyfriend, which became quite popular, especially during Valentine's Day,\" says Divya. According to her, she wanted to do something similar in India with a few intentions in mind. Firstly, she wanted to see \"how people would react to it,\" and secondly, she posted it as a joke. However, she was open to going on a date if, in her words, \"he was good enough.\" Currently, Divya's video has more than 5 million views. Photo: Getty Images \"Money was never the reason for this. I have a job and a supportive family. I added the money factor so that I could filter out some guys and not go out with creeps,\" says Divya. \"I really thought I would get some good comments on it, and would go out with a stranger and have a good time,\" she adds. Another reason, according to Divya, was to get \"some engagement on her social media\", which she clearly succeeded. She also thought that the video might help some people who are feeling lonely, in their fast-paced life. \"Renting a boyfriend\" is not a new thing in Japan. In fact, in Japan you can not only rent out a boyfriend or girlfriend, you can also rent out a dad, or someone from the family. Sounds like people in Japan are lonely? Well, that is correct. A recent survey published in The Japan News in 2023 shows that almost 40 per cent of the people in Japan are lonely. People in Japan are lonely. Photo: Unsplash Moreover, in February 2021, then-Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga appointed Tetsushi Sakamoto to the role of Japan’s first “Minister of Loneliness” to address the increasing suicide rates in the country. The ageing population and the lifestyle choices of Japan are to be blamed. Experts believe that this is the reason why services like this are pretty normalised and accepted in Japan. Shreya Kaul, a counselling psychologist, also agrees with this concept and tells India Today that Japan, as a nation, has an ongoing problem of loneliness. \"Loneliness in terms of mental health is by far one of the biggest issues and concerns that people face. So, services such as renting a girlfriend or cuddling services, have been introduced so that men don't feel lonely or people don't feel lonely in general. So, coming from that point of view, I think maybe Japan and the Japanese culture and people were more accepting of this,\" says Shreya. Did you know that in Japan you can rent a boyfriend, a girlfriend and even a family? [ð¹ Tyen Rasif / tyenrasif] pic.twitter.com/jheCNOVB9n — Massimo (@Rainmaker1973) March 24, 2024 Another reason, according to experts, is that sex is not a taboo in Japan, unlike in India. It was not only Divya who uploaded a reel about renting herself out for a date. In fact, model and athlete Prince Singh also uploaded a similar reel, where he posted about how he could go on a date for different prices. His reel also crossed a million views, and even though he had some hate for it, it was not as severe as Divya's. Check out his reel: A post shared by Prince Singh (@thatbrownart) But why did they receive so much hate? Is there a deeper meaning and a reflection of our society? Well, experts say YES. Absy Sam, a counselling psychologist from Mumbai, explains that in India, even with no intention of being inappropriate, the renting-out plan can fail on many levels. \"One reason is, of course, the gender roles that dictate how women should behave, and there's also moral policing,\" says Absy. Shreya also agrees. She explains that in India the patriarchal influence is very strong, and while the person [who uploaded the reel] might have good intentions and not be 'dirty', the context of the country and culture plays a huge role in this. \"In a nation where a woman's honour is tied to the family's reputation, any service a woman offers is frowned upon,\" Shreya says. She also adds that in India, \"calling someone a wh**e or a prostitute is still considered an insult, and sex workers are not respected; they are viewed with a sense of degradation. So, anytime someone tries to rent out services to another person, the automatic assumption is that the person is disgusting and low.\" Shreya says, \"This is associated with a stigma.\" \"In India, discussions about sex and romantic partners are still hushed and done behind closed doors, so a concept like this wouldn't work\", Shreya adds. Ultimately, Divya, who posted this reel, discovered the hard way that what is encouraged in countries like Japan is clearly trolled in India."

Radhika wore an immaculate collection comprising high couture pieces, including a custom Versace gown that took a year of coordination between her fashion stylist and the brand, and an archival Yves Saint Laurent for Dior dress from 1959. The outfit that made the most buzz was a personalised chiffon gown by London-based designer Robert Wun. The dress had a love letter that Anant wrote to Radhika when they first started dating printed on the chiffon. Radhika Merchant wearing a gown with a love letter by Anant Ambani printed on it. (Photo: Instagram/Rhea Kapoor) This sartorial move was an endearing ode to their love story. As she admitted to Vogue, she did so to be able to show her kids and grandkids that this is what their love was. Love, of course, is the true hero of every wedding, and modern couples are making sure that it takes centre stage during celebrations—Anant and Radhika being one such example. Over the years, personalisation has emerged as a top wedding trend, no longer restricted to having a peppy wedding hashtag or the couple’s initials printed on wedding stationery, cake, or decoration backdrop. These personalised elements mostly reflect the bride and groom’s personalities and their roots. “Couples now plan their own weddings, unlike previous times when parents were solely in charge of planning and arrangements. This shift in power is one of the key reasons we see a lot of demand for personalisation at weddings,” Dakshita Bhatla, founder, lead producer and designer of wedding planning company DB And Spaces, tells India Today . Mohsin Khan of Vivah Luxury Weddings, meanwhile, believes that celebrity and big fat weddings are fuelling the demand for personalisation. There is quite a lot of focus on highlighting the love story at weddings as well. Couture, the route Radhika took with her customised love letter gown, is one popular way. In 2016, when fashion designer Kresha Bajaj got married, she designed a love story lehenga for her vows. Designer Kresh Bajaj's wedding lehenga with details of her love story embroidered on the hem. (Photo: Kresha Bajaj) Details of her love story were elaborately embroidered all over her wedding lehenga—the proposal moments, their milestones, and all the important moments until the wedding were sewn on the lehenga. A closer look at Kresha Bajaj's self-designed love story lehenga (Photo: Kresha Bajaj) This urge to turn the wedding outfit into a love memorabilia continues to be strong, with Radhika’s unabashed take on it. Meanwhile, here are some quick ideas to add a hint of your love story to the wedding outfit: The decor: “The first thing the couple and guests resonate with when they first enter the wedding venue is the decor. From little details like the table centerpieces to extravagant setups, there is a lot that can be done to highlight a couple’s love story at the wedding,” says Dakshita. To have a photo wall that depicts a couple’s journey together as part of the wedding decor is a popular concept. So is the idea of setting up a dedicated screen to showcase their pictures and pre-wedding shoot snippets. Though they do a good job of highlighting the love story, they have become mainstream. A photo wall as a couple's stage backdrop (Photo: DB And Spaces) Novelty and creativity are essential in the wedding personalisation business today, especially when one of the aims is to go viral and have good photographic content for social media, which planners admit is one of the key reasons behind the demand for personalised decor elements. To bring your love story to the forefront in wedding decorations, you can consider: A love storyboard: It can include how and where you met, some important dates, and other details. A love storyboard (Photo: Innocept Studio) Personalised booths: Did you meet your partner in school? Have a setup similar to that installed at your wedding. If you two bond over Bollywood or books, you can have a setup based on that theme as well. Speaking your heart out with the planners is key to coming up with ideas that resonate with your love story the best. A tennis-themed booth at a sport-enthusiast couple's wedding brunch. (Photo: Aroosi Events) Table decor: The tables can be adorned with dainty elements like photo frames or printed keepsakes with fun facts about the couple. Fun fact napkins for wedding (Photo: Etsy) Favour stations: Pick meaningful wedding favours for the guests (beyond the quintessential potlis and haathphools) and go for personalised notes that tell a tale. They can even be in the form of a newspaper or a newsletter like that from Lady Whistledown (Bridgerton fans would know). Lady Whistledown-inspired letter at Bridgerton-themed wedding celebrations. (Photo: MomenteWeddings) Interactive games: Apart from the couple shoe game, you can also plan some fun games for the guests that give a glimpse of your love story.

For instance, a couple who tied the knot in Jaipur had a McDonald’s-themed after-party as it was their favourite date spot in the initial years of dating. Take cues from a couple who had a McDonalds-themed wedding after-party. (Photo: House on the Clouds/Atisuto) To highlight your wedding, you don’t always have to go loud with obvious elements. When Yash and Priyanka, a Delhi-based couple, got married in April this year, they opted for prayer flags as ceiling decor for their engagement. For them, it denoted their love for trekking and hill getaways—where they spot these prayer flags. Prayer Flags for decor at a couple's engagement. (Photo: Deep Bhatt Photography) “The best thing about having this detail was we could give away those prayer flags as keepsakes to the guests who joined us at the wedding,” Yash said. Apart from the decor, little and big gestures also go a long way in letting the world (guests) know about your bond. It can be your wedding entry song or a special speech for your partner during celebrations. You can even get a song produced based on your love story for your wedding and play it for your entry, another key trend taking over Indian weddings. Just remember this: Plan everything how you want to but leave the execution to the planners so that you can enjoy the celebrations and live in the moment."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Social media offers a wealth of opportunities to learn about virtually anything. However, the online world also harbours darker corners filled with various theories. One popular example is the Simpsons theory, which suggests that the long-running sitcom has an uncanny ability to predict the future. Another viral theory circulating on the Internet is the toothpaste theory, which is woven around the ingredients found in this everyday essential. Multiple social media posts claim that the tiny square you see on the bottom of the tube of your toothpaste is actually part of a colour code related to the ingredients present in the product. A post shared by Naddy Tripsy (@nadleneyebbi) \"This theory is false,\" Dr Vinod Tyagi, consultant, department of dentistry, Yatharth Super Speciality Hospital, Noida Extension, tells India Today . The doctor explains that the coloured bars, known as 'eye marks' or 'colour marks', are used in the manufacturing process for packaging and cutting purposes. They help machines detect where to cut and seal the tubes and have no relation to the product’s ingredients. Toothpaste ingredients are listed on the packaging, as mandated by regulatory authorities, and consumers should refer to this information for accurate details about the product. Dr Sachin Deepak Mehta, a Mumbai-based dentist, agrees and says, \"Contrary to popular belief, the small squares found at the bottom of toothpaste tubes do not indicate its composition or ingredients.\" He also mentions that these squares serve a practical function; they assist light sensors on tube-sealing machines in identifying the tube's end. This ensures precise cutting and sealing of the tubes during manufacturing processes. Further, Dr Tyagi shares that toothpaste typically contains several key ingredients , each serving a specific purpose: All these ingredients work together to clean teeth, prevent tooth decay, freshen breath, and maintain overall oral health. Specific formulations may vary depending on the brand and the intended purpose of the toothpaste. To figure out what ingredients are present in your toothpaste, you can check the ingredient list printed on the packaging. Moreover, the front or sides of the toothpaste packaging often highlight key features such as 'whitening', 'fluoride', 'sensitive', etc. These labels give you clues about specific ingredients or benefits the toothpaste offers. Understanding the ingredients in your toothpaste is vital (Photo: Pexels/Ron Lach) \"There are several different types of toothpaste available, each designed to serve specific purposes and address various oral health needs,\" says Dr Mehta. Here are some common types of toothpaste and their purposes: Dr Mehta shares that it's important to choose a toothpaste that addresses your specific oral health needs and preferences. Consult with your dentist if you have any concerns or if you're unsure which type of toothpaste is best suited for you. Adding to this, Dr Mehta says, \"A consistent oral hygiene routine can significantly enhance self-esteem and confidence by ensuring fresh breath and a radiant smile. This, in turn, fosters better social interactions and may contribute positively to your professional life. Oral hygiene goes beyond mere dental care; it plays a pivotal role in maintaining overall quality of life and holistic well-being.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story It is not quite Europe. It has one foot on that continent and one firmly in Asia. The pre-Soviet country of Georgia is at once a revelation and a mystery for travellers seeking to peek beyond the usual choices of mainland Europe or Southeast Asia. For one, getting a visa to Georgia is ostensibly easy, but we will get to that in a bit. Then there's the ease of flying. A direct flight from Delhi to Tbilisi takes only five hours, and before you know it, you have landed in Georgia. Georgia straddles two continents, Europe and Asia. Photo: Getty Images So, when we planned a family trip to this little country a few months ago, the pros outnumbered the cons. I had a valid Schengen and Japan visa; both of which allow Indian passport holders to enter Georgia visa-free. For people who don't, Georgia needs an e-visa that you can get on their immigration portal. Now, while the process looks pretty simple on the face of it, here's the deal: you need to be really patient - and I mean really - while applying for an e-visa on their portal. The payment gateway is terrible. You get errors every time you click on the final step. The capital of Georgia is Tbilisi. Photo: Getty Images The trick is simple: choose an ungodly hour to sit with the e-visa application. The portal isn't quite equipped to deal with a lot of traffic at once; so, logging on late at night is advised. Once you manage to do this part, the rest is comparatively easy. The problem is in the result of the visa. All your documents can be in order, but you might still get a rejection ( the battle was personal, yk ). The rejection rate of Georgian visas is quite high: 72%. Liberty Square, Tbilisi. Photo: Author If you are indeed planning a vacation to this Caucasian country, keep ample time in hand. You get a revert on your application within 5 working days. If your application is rejected, you can start a fresh one within 10 days from the result. If not, thank your luck and board that flight. Indigo flies Delhi-Tbilisi-Delhi direct thrice a week. True to its low-cost-carrier promise, there's no complimentary food or entertainment on the plane ( thank you, Airbus A321 ). However, you sure can get your instant poha by paying a bomb on the flight. You do get drinking water in paper cups though. Anyway. Mount Kazbek. Photo: Getty Images Landing in Tbilisi was uneventful, and we headed to immigration. I will confess: I was pretty rattled by the numerous disturbing tales of Georgia deporting Indian passengers left, right, and centre without no rime or reason. So, while we did have a holiday booked, there was that slight consternation about making it past passport control. My exchange with the official at the counter was brief: \"Show me visa?\" \"There's a Schengen and a Japan visa there.\" \"Ok.\" Passport stamped. For the rest of my family members too, it was quite a smooth exit out of passport control, even though two of them were on e-visas. All doubts laid to rest, we finally headed to the conveyor belt and out of the Shota Rustaveli Tbilisi International Airport, into the crisp Tbilisi air. The temperature on my phone-from-the-forty-degree-hell-called-Delhi said 8 degrees Celsius. Single digit. Eight. There was a biting wind blowing. It was half past one in the night and our destination lay just twenty minutes from the airport. Sameba, or the Holy Trinity Cathedral of Tbilisi lit up against the historic city centre. Photo: Getty Images The city centre of Tbilisi is a stone's throw from the airport, unlike other, bigger cities. The city is hilly. It has a perfectly preserved old town where tourists stroll along all night. You can cover the concentrated historic old town on foot in just a few hours. The more upscale centre of Tbilisi is the Freedom or Liberation Square. Shota Rustaveli Avenue is the artery of the city. The Parliament, the National Museum, the souvenir-shopping district, the café quarter are all in this area. Freedom or Liberation Square, Tbilisi. Photo: Getty Images The one name you will bump into in most corners in Tbilisi is Shota Rustaveli's. Rustaveli is the national poet of Georgia. His seminal work is the national poem of the country, The Knight in the Panther's Skin. Rustaveli lived and wrote under the patronage of the 'King of Kings' of Georgia, Queen Tamar. It was the Golden Age of Georgia. For Georgians, who have been ravaged by wars for centuries, Queen Tamar's reign is held in the highest regard till date. 'King' Tamar of Georgia. Photo: Wikimedia Commons You will come across starry-eyed Gen-Zers who speak of Tamar with that sense of nostalgia for a time they did not live in. Older Georgians, who have fought wars in the country's army, echo the same sentiment. It is Tamar who still has Georgia united across generations. The other unifier today in this country of wonders is the strong hope of being part of the EU. Georgia has been accorded an EU member status, but they have yet to enter the hallowed portals of the European Union. So, Georgians have been rising against the sitting government, Georgian Dream, to see their dream of joining the EU realised by hoping to see a Soviet-level diktat not turning into law.

Photo: Getty Images Georgia embraced Christianity in the 4th century AD when St Nino, a female evangelist, converted King Mirian III into this new religion. Since then, Georgia has been mostly Christian save in the Soviet years, when churches were converted into public baths, desecrated by the 'Godless Communists' and what not. Georgia has reclaimed religion with a vengeance today, almost as if to compensate for the years of atheistic debauchery under the Soviets. Svetitskhoveli Cathedral Complex, Mtskheta. Photo: Getty Images You will find the home of Joseph Stalin just outside of Tbilisi, in a small municipality called Gori. Stalin never quite acknowledged that he was born in Georgia, but never denied it outright either. It is in Gori that Stalin spent the first five years of his life, born to a poor shoemaker who beat up his wife and wasted his life on the bottle. Stalin moved out. He spent the next decade in rented rooms across the area, before enrolling in the Russian Orthodox Theological Seminary in Tiflis to train as a priest. At Stalin's home in Gori, outside Tbilisi. Photo: Author One might credit those years of training for Stalin's 180-degree turn from religion. In fact, the Theological Seminary was one of the first religious institutes that Stalin shuttered shut when he came into power. Today, Stalin's humble beginnings sit next to a sprawling museum on the steps of which lazy Caucasian Shepherds greet you with a yawn. In the complex is the railway coach Stalin rode to the Yalta Conference in 1945 and changed the modern world forever. The railway coach that took Stalin to the Yalta Conference in 1945.

The other Georgians are busy making a life out of the hand the Soviets have dealt them, trying to move out of their orbit into Europe's promise of achhe din . For now, that doesn't seem too easy. Every turn of Georgia is a veritable lesson in history. In terms of geography too, Georgia hits you with stunning landscapes, from the mountains to the sea. The Russia-Georgia Friendship Monument. Photo: Author Mount Kazbek, one of the highest peaks in the Caucasus range, sits right under the nose of Russia, south of its border with Georgia.

Khinkali is a giant-sized Georgian momo with fillings ranging from veggies to minced meat. Unlike the dumplings we are used to eating, khinkali is packed in with the stew too. In essence, you need to hold a khinkali with both your hands and bite into it to make sure you get the entire burst of flavour. Khinkali, Georgian dumplings.

Indeed, the best part of Georgia lies in just how affordable life is. The staple food, khachapuri, is bread with a filling of cheese, sometimes egg. Think of it as a large pizza but the cheese within the bread instead of on top of it. Cheese is ubiquitous in Georgian cuisine. Adjarian khachapuri, the bread boat that comes with cheese and egg. Photo: Getty Images Among beverages, wine holds the topmost spot and comes cheaper than a bottle of water. Given that Georgia is the birthplace of wine, that's a given. In the Kakheti region of Georgia, where the beautiful rolling vineyards touch the feet of the Caucasus mountains, the first evidence of winemaking in the history of humankind was found a few years ago. A wine cellar in Georgia, with wine stored in qvevri. Photo: Getty Images It was the Georgians who, eight thousand years ago, devised the qvevri, or the earthen pots that could stand upright and were placed under the ground for fermentation of the grapes, without the flavour being compromised. Till the qvevri, wine was stored in animal-leather cases, which obviously wasn't a very feasible option. It altered the flavour of the wine. So, your best European grapes would taste like putrid flesh after a while. Not in Georgia though. Georgia takes its winemaking legacy very seriously. The Georgian winemaking process is more complex than the European process. Of course, the wine tastes better. Qvevri, the wine vessels of Georgia. Photo: Getty Images In homes all across the country, you will find families making their own wine. You get to taste wine at every turn of the corner here. The Georgian amber wine deserves a special mention for just how light it is on the palate. Bonus: Wine here does not give you a hangover. On my last evening in Tbilisi, I sat down with a glass of amber from a small batch of grapes somewhere in Kakheti, in a bar on Rustaveli Avenue, as a musician belted out local classics.

It was a silent protest against that bill that the government just turned into law. I boarded the flight back home to forty degrees a few hours later, wondering about the Georgian dream of being in the EU, now pushed a little farther by the Georgian Dream at the centre.

Nadugi, the famous Georgian appetiser, comprises a cheese filling within thin elastic cheese flat cakes. Photo: Getty Images When to visit: May to June, or September to October will help you avoid the crowds in Georgia. The lowlands around Tbilisi have superb weather this time of the year, letting you dodge the summer heat and the frozen winter months. If you are visiting the Black Sea coast (Batumi), try the warm summer months of July-August. This is also a good time to go hiking since you will find the mountains snow-free. What to see: Tbilisi, the capital, gets the most tourists because of its accessibility and ease of travel. Gergeti Trinity Church. Photo: Getty Images Batumi is on the Black Sea coast and attracts many people. Here, you will find the statues of star-cross'd lovers Ali and Nino, two giant moving metal sculptures that glide towards each other at 7 pm every day, only to pass through their stacked segments. They never meet. The story goes: Ali, an Azerbaijani Muslim, fell in love with a Georgian princess called Nino. Soon, the First World War hit home and Ali was killed. This tragic tale of the lovers inspired a 1937 Austrian novel called Ali and Nino , and then the famous Statue of Love by Georgian artist Tamara Kvesitadze in 2010. Ali and Nino's Statue of Love in Batumi. Photo: Unsplash/Alexandr Voronsky The other places to see in this country are Kutaisi, the ski resort of Mestia, 'City of Love' Sighnaghi, Georgia's famous wine region Kakheti, and Mtskheta. Drive down the Georgian Military Highway through the Kazbegi National Park for some stunning views of the Caucasus Mountains. How to get around: Getting around Georgia is very cheap compared to major European cities. You could book taxis at throwaway rates (try GoTrip). Bolt is also operational in the country and quite affordable. Batumi and Tbilisi are connected by direct trains. For Indian passport holders: Georgia is visa-free for Indian passport holders if you have a US, UK, Schengen or Japan visa . If you don't have any of these visas, you need an e-visa to enter Georgia. A decision on your e-visa application will take 5 days to arrive, and the rejection rates are pretty high, but you can reapply. So, a point to keep in mind: keep ample time in hand to account for the e-visa process. Each e-visa application costs 20 USD + 15 USD + 2% service fee, which amounts to about Rs 3,000. The visa fee is non-refundable if your application is rejected."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story “I still remember, I first tried Japanese cuisine on my 19th birthday,” says Jafar, a 24-year-old engineer from Delhi. For Jafar, the idea of Japanese cuisine was cultivated in his mind from the world of anime, a hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan, which, in his words, makes Japanese food look “otherwordly”. “My favourite is Udon Ramen. It is spicy, tangy, chatpata , and an overall banger of a dish,” says Jafar. Jafar is not the only one. Japanese cuisine, extending beyond just sushi and ramen, is gaining significant popularity amongst Indians, especially Gen Z. Udon is a thick noodle made from wheat flour. Photo: Unspalsh So, what's driving this trend? We have to understand that the trend is a combination of several factors, but experts largely attribute it to the growing appreciation of Japanese culture through various channels — print media (manga), social media, and, of course, anime (we will get to them in a bit ). Let's have a look. Just like Korean culture, Japanese culture is also finding love among Indians. A major chunk of the credit goes to the anime and manga that have found their way to a lot of Indian Gen Z, which are driving the demand for Japanese food in India ( remember the McDonald's collab with Naruto? ). “I do indeed believe that there is a correlation between my fondness for Japanese food and my liking of Japanese pop culture. Whenever I see Japanese cuisine in any form of entertainment media, I get the urge to try it out. Even now, I feel like whenever I consume Japanese food, I always think back to how the food is presented in anime, movies, and manga”, Shaurya Bansal, a 24-year-old junior 3D generalist, tells us. McDonald’sðä @studiopierrot pic.twitter.com/h8GNWiAAxH — McDonald's (@McDonalds) February 20, 2024 Anime, known for its complex storylines and distinctive art, has captured the preference of 83% of Indians over other animated content options, according to JetSynthesys . This growing preference has expanded beyond popular series like 'Naruto' and 'Pokémon', delving into many other anime series. This expansion is driven by the advent of not only OTT platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, but also several other online sites that provide access to underrated animes. For instance, Seemon, a 27-year-old illustrator, tells us, \"Anime has some epic depictions of food, they take great care to animate every little scene, whether it is a battle scene or a dinner scene. There is an anime called 'Food Wars' which is all about cooking competitions and chefs making elaborate dishes.\" Food Wars is the story of Soma Yukihira who enrols in an elite culinary school to become a full-time chef and surpass his father's culinary skills. Photo: IMDb Chef David Myers, who has over 20 years of experience in the food industry, and is the owner of Adrift Kaya, a modern Japanese ‘izakaya’ (stay-drink-place) at JW Marriott Aerocity, New Delhi, also credits Japanese pop culture for the “incredibly positive” response for his ‘izakaya’. “When readers encounter detailed and appealing depictions of Japanese dishes in the manga, their curiosity and interest are piqued. This extends beyond common Japanese foods to include more obscure and unique dishes, such as Japanese curry-filled omelettes. These tantalising portrayals encourage readers to seek out and try these foods in real life,” says Chef Myers. Chef Surri says that health-conscious buyers in India are attracted to the empowering pros of traditional Japanese food, which stresses the utilisation of fresh ingredients and a well-balanced nutritional profile. Japanese cuisine is known for its fresh ingredients. Photo: Unsplash If you’re a foodie, and your Instagram Explore page has more food than anything else, you’re not alone. Japanese cuisine and food like ramen, sushi, seafood tempura, etc, have all made their way to a lot of our Instagram feeds, thanks to food enthusiasts, and celebs from Taylor Swift to Kendal Jenner. In India, before sushi became a street food staple, experts say that enjoying Japanese cuisine was always considered a special dining experience. Chef Myers says, \"Young people are increasingly drawn to Japanese cuisine for its visually appealing presentation. The rise of global travel and exposure through the media has made them more adventurous and open to diverse culinary experiences. The vibrant dining culture, like izakaya experiences, resonates well with their desire for both novelty and quality in their food choices.\" Japanese cuisine features a variety of ingredients which creates an incredibly colourful palette. Photo: SHIN'YA Moreover, Japanese cuisine features a variety of ingredients like soy sauce, fish, vegetables, dashi stock, mirin, tofu, noodles, pickles, wasabi, ginger, and green tea, creating an incredibly colourful palette. This vibrant mix attracts not only young Indians but adults as well. Now, we know that Japanese cuisine is becoming all the rage in India. But how is this rage impacting the food scene in India? Well, this rage is reflected in India in various ways, from sushi becoming a street food dish to a lot more Japanese high-end restaurants opening up. Here's a look. If five years ago someone told us that sushi would one day be readily available in the lanes of a lot of cities in India, no one would have believed them. But today, a lot of tiny outlets or food trucks are selling sushi and other Japanese food for less than Rs 300. Remember that viral girl from the Chatori Gali of Lucknow? She put her UPSC preparation on hold to sell the “Indian version of sushi”, which became an instant hit (especially amongst the young crowd). Not only on the street, Japanese cuisine is changing the fine-dining experience of India too. However, with Japanese cuisine becoming more common, fine players are trying to push for more elaborate, authentic dining experiences for their consumers. We recently visited SHIN'YA, nestled within the Hyatt Regency Gurgaon, in the national capital region. Tonbara Kushi Yaki is a Japanese dish that consists of skewered and grilled pork belly served at SHIN'YA. Photo: SHIN'YA An exquisite new Japanese eatery and bar that is named after the Japanese word for 'midnight', SHIN'YA offers a unique blend of traditional and modern Japanese cuisine in a relaxed, social setting. What’s so unique about it? Well, apart from a carefully curated Japanese menu that transfers you to Flavour-town Japan, the place is also open till 3 am daily and converts itself into a destination for late-night dining and drinks in Gurugram. “Whoever wants to eat here can eat in a laid-back manner first, but later, after 9-10 pm, it will be converted into a high-energy bar,” says Chef Adi Melaz, who curated the menu of SHIN’YA. There is no doubt that Indians love Japanese cuisine, but a lot of high-end restaurants are also trying to cater to people who are not so fond of them, and also to vegetarians. Crispy asparagus sushi rolls. Photo: Author “Given the huge vegetarian populace in India, increasing vegetarian choices in Japanese food is fundamental to taking special care of a more extensive crowd,” says Suri. Chef Melaz also agrees and says while designing the menu of SHIN'YA, he kept in mind the Indian taste bud. “Indians do look for spiciness, creaminess and gravy in their food, especially in their sushi,” says Chef Melaz. Veg sushi or the real deal; one thing is for sure - Japanese cuisine has found a place for itself in the Indian food scene. And it is here to stay."

The pub is owned by Vinay, who is also an accused in the case and a friend of Darshan. Another Kannada actor, Chikkanna, has also been summoned by Bengaluru Police for questioning in the case. The police have so far arrested 19 people , including leading Darshan and rumoured partner Pavithra Gowda for the murder of Renukaswamy. The 37-year-old Chikkanna, who appears primarily in comic roles, was allegedly with Darshan on June 8 night , when the crime was committed. Chikkanna is believed to have been with Darshan before the actor went to the shed where Renukaswamy was held and tortured. An official told India Today TV that actors Darshan and Chikanna, along with Vinay, will be taken to the private club to recreate the crime scene as part of their investigation. Police suspect that after locking up Renukaswamy in the godown , the accused returned to the pub to discuss a further plan of action. The investigation into Renukaswamy's murder has intensified, with police searching for two missing mobile phones connected to the case. One of the phones belonged to the victim, Renukaswamy, and the other to another accused. It is suspected that the phones were thrown into a drain near Summanahalli, where Renukaswamy's body was dumped, in an attempt to destroy evidence. Police are currently conducting a search of the drain to recover the mobile phones, which are believed to be crucial pieces of evidence in the case. Renukaswamy, a fan, had allegedly sent some obscene messages to Darshan's rumoured partner Pavithra Gowda on social media, which infuriated the 47-year-old actor, according to police.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Kannada actor Darshan Thoogudeepa was arrested in connection with a murder case on June 11 in Bengaluru. Darshan became one of the leading actors in the Kannada film industry by playing a righteous man in films. However, for the past 10 years, his name has been embroiled in multiple controversies. In this piece, let us have a look at five controversies involving Darshan that made headlines. Back in 2011, Darshan was arrested after his wife, Vijayalakshmi filed a complaint of domestic violence . He spent 14 days in judicial custody at Parappana Agrahara during that time and was later let out on bail. At that time, they resolved their issues out of court. In 2016, his wife once again sought the help of police after she accused him of 'objectionable' behaviour. The same year, Darshan hit his brother Dinakar and his wife as they intervened in a fight between him and his wife, Vijayalakshmi. Since that incident, Dinakar and Darshan have not been on talking terms. In 2018, actors Darshan, Devaraj and their friend Antony met with a car crash. Their SUV rammed into a street light in North Mysuru, which left them all with injuries. While the onlookers claimed that Darshan was driving the car, his friend Anthony Roy was booked under the sections of IPC (Indian Penal Code - Section 279 - Rash driving on a public way and sections 337 and 338 - endangering life or personal safety of others and probing). In 2021, Darshan was accused of allegedly assaulting a waiter at a hotel in Mysuru. However, it is speculated that the police had to cover up the incident and compensated the waiter with Rs 50,000. Again in 2023, Darshan allegedly beat up a waiter and customers in a pub in Mysuru after an argument broke out between them. Darshan, his wife Vijayalakshmi and his farmhouse manager Nagaraj, were accused of illegally keeping migratory birds at his farmhouse in Kempainahundi village. The case was filed after Darshan reportedly said in an interview that he has a bar-headed goose. Reportedly, the interviewer showed the visuals of the birds kept in a cage. Also, the state forest department team conducted searches at his home after an image of him allegedly wearing a 'tiger claw' pendant went viral. In November 2023, actor Darshan was booked after his pet dog attacked a woman . According to her, she noticed three dogs belonging to actor Darshan next to her car. When she asked them to take them away, Darshan's men argued with her. She alleged that one of the dogs charged at her, bit her multiple times and tore her clothes. The police investigation, however, claimed that Darshan wasn't directly involved in the incident. Not just these, he was also in the news for many other controversies. In 2015, he shot at a stranger with his pistol as he was talking on his phone loudly. The stranger, however, escaped unhurt. At that time, a famous Kannada actor was with Darshan. He was scared to see his 'rash' behaviour and has maintained a distance since then. Last year, he was also accused of partying late at a club in Bengaluru beyond permissible hours."

Darshan later went to the shed after partying where Renukaswamy was allegedly kidnapped and tortured before his death, they added. Darshan's friend Pavithra Gowda, also arrested in the case, was present inside the shed during the assault of Renukaswamy, sources said. Renukaswamy had allegedly written derogatory messages against her on social media , which infuriated Darshan, according to police.

On Monday, Bengaluru Police took the accused to the same shop to recreate the crime scene. Darshan might be taken to Mysuru to recreate the crime scene.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A video of popular Kannada actor Darshan Thoogudeepa, arrested in connection with the murder of his fan , assaulting and threatening a businessman at a pub in Mysuru went viral. The incident occurred on February 26 last year. According to the police, Darshan and his aides were at the pub when a businessman named Yeshwant and his family arrived to celebrate his wife's birthday. Around 12:30 am, Yeshwant requested the disco jockey (DJ) to play songs of the late Kannada actor Puneeth Rajkumar. This request supposedly triggered Darshan and his aides. An argument broke out with Darshan and his aides demanding that only songs from his movies would be played. Tension escalated quickly, with the actor and his group allegedly abusing and threatening both Yeshwant and the DJ, as shown in the video. An FIR was registered against Darshan’s aides. However, no FIR was filed against Darshan at that time. Later, the police clarified that Darshan was indeed involved in the altercation. On June 11, Darshan and his friend Pavithra Gowda were arrested in connection with the murder of his 33-year-old fan Renukaswamy. Renukaswamy, an autorickshaw driver and a member of Darshan's fan club, was allegedly kidnapped from Chitradurga district on June 8 after sending derogatory messages to Gowda. His body was later found near Sumanahalli Bridge in Bengaluru. Sources told India Today TV earlier that Darshan was partying at a pub in Bengaluru on the day of Renukaswamy's murder. The actor later went to the shed after partying where Renukaswamy was allegedly kidnapped and tortured before his death, they said. A post-mortem report of Renukaswamy revealed that he was tortured and given electric shocks before his death. Details of the alleged torture were disclosed by Dhanraj, who was arrested in connection with the case on June 16.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Karnataka government is looking to challenge a court stay on the demolition of embattled actor Darshan's home in Bengaluru, which is allegedly built on a stormwater drain. In 2016, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) served a notice to Darshan, stating that a portion of his house encroached on a storm water drain and was slated for demolition. However, Darshan sought legal recourse and secured a stay order from the court, temporarily halting the demolition process. Now, the government is looking to move the court to challenge the stay order. When asked about the government's plan on the issue, Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar said, \"You can get a stay, I can get a stay, anybody can get a stay. However, we will seek orders from the court to vacate the stay\". According to reports, Darshan's home is among several other houses at Ideal Homes Layout in Bengaluru's Rajarajeshwari Nagar area that have received the notice. The development comes after the popular Kannada actor, along with 16 others, was arrested in the sensational Renukaswamy murder case . Darshan is accused of killing Renukaswamy, a man who claimed to be his fan. Renukaswamy allegedly sent some obscene messages to actor Pavithra Gowda, Darshan's friend and rumoured partner, on social media, which infuriated the 47-year-old actor. According to sources, one of the accused, Raghavendra, who is part of Darshan's fan club in Chitradurga, had brought Renukaswamy to a shed in RR Nagar, on the pretext that Darshan wanted to meet him. It was in this shed that he was allegedly tortured and killed. Renukaswamy's body was found near a stormwater drain next to an apartment in Sumanahalli on June 9."

The police will produce accused Darshan, Vinay, Pradosh, and Dhanraj in court this afternoon. The police are expected to ask for a two-day extension of the accused's custody to continue their investigation thoroughly and gather more evidence. However, it is not clear whether they will get the extension. The court is expected to remand the four accused to judicial custody today. Actor Darshan will be sent to Parappana Agrahara Prison if judicial custody is ordered. This will be Darshan's second time at Parappana Agrahara Prison if he is remanded to judicial custody today. Earlier in 2011, Darshan was in judicial custody for 28 days after assaulting his wife. So far, during the investigation into the Renukaswamy murder case, it has been revealed that the actor Darshan borrowed Rs 40 lakh from one of his friends to pay off other accused to destroy evidence connected with the murder. This was confessed to by the actor in a statement to the police."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Kannada actor Darshan Thoogudeepa, who was arrested for the torture and murder of a 33-year-old man named Renukaswamy , has been sent to judicial custody until July 4 . Darshan, along with three other accused, Pradosh, Vinay, and Dhanraj, will be lodged in the Parappana Agrahara jail in Bengaluru. This is the same prison where the actor was jailed 13 years ago in another case for assaulting his wife. In September 2011, Darshan was arrested for assaulting his wife Vijayalakshmi and was sent to custody for 28 days in the Parappana Agrahara jail. The actor was later released on bail, and the couple then resolved the matter, and she withdrew the case. Darshan was arrested in the Renukaswamy murder case on June 11 and had been in police custody since then. The Bengaluru court remanded 13 other accused, including the actor's friend Pavithra Gowda, to 14-day judicial custody two days ago. The Special Public Prosecutor Prasanna Kumar requested the judge to move some of the accused to different prisons. He argued that if all of them are in one jail, they might conspire and should be kept separately to prevent this. A total of 17 people are accused in the murder of Renukaswamy, an auto driver from Chitradurga. According to police sources, the victim was a fan of the actor, and he had sent obscene messages to Gowda, which enraged Darshan, allegedly leading to his murder. Darshan’s fan club members allegedly kidnapped Renukaswamy and tortured and killed him. The actor was also allegedly involved in assaulting the victim. Renukaswamy's body was found near a stormwater drain adjacent to an apartment in Bengaluru's Sumanahalli area on June 9. His autopsy revealed details of gruesome torture."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In Japan, cases of flesh-eating bacteria have reached a record high. The outbreak of Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome (STSS), also called the \"flesh-eating bacteria\", has affected almost 1,000 people from the beginning of the year to June 2, according to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. The disease has a mortality rate of 30% and can become fatal within 48 hours of infection. \"Most of the deaths happen within 48 hours. As soon as a patient notices swelling in the foot in the morning, it can expand to the knee by noon, and they can die within 48 hours,\" Ken Kikuchi, a professor in infectious diseases at Tokyo Women's Medical University, told Bloomberg. People have been urged to maintain hand hygiene and to treat any open wounds. Patients who carry Group A Streptococcus (GAS) in their intestines, which could contaminate hands through faeces. WHAT IS STREPTOCOCCAL TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME? Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome (STSS) is a rare but serious bacterial infection. It develops quickly and becomes life-threatening. The bacteria spreads into deep tissues and the bloodstream and releases certain toxins that can lead to the development of shock and organ failure. Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome is often associated with \"flesh-eating bacteria\" because it can be caused by a severe infection of Group A Streptococcus (GAS), which can lead to a rapidly progressing infection that destroys soft tissue, including muscles, fat, and skin, giving the appearance of the flesh being eaten away. Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome has a mortality rate of 30%. (Photo: Getty Images) SYMPTOMS OF STREPTOCOCCAL TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME Once initial symptoms occur, hypotension generally develops within 24 to 48 hours. The first symptoms of STSS include fever and chills, muscle aches, nausea and vomiting. Soon, after the symptoms kick in, it results in low blood pressure (hypotension), organ failure, tachycardia (faster than normal heart rate) and tachypnea (rapid breathing). The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cited an example: someone with kidney failure may not make urine. Someone with liver failure may bleed or bruise a lot or their skin and eyes may turn yellow. Medical attention is needed immediately, once the symptoms are recognised. HOW DOES IT SPREAD? Since GAS causes STSS, it can be quite contagious. Generally, people spread the bacteria to others through respiratory droplets or direct contact. Group A strep bacteria can also spread through food, if it is not handled properly. However, it is rare for someone with STSS to spread the infection to another person. PREVENTION Preventing STSS involves practising basic hygiene, like washing hands regularly and covering the mouth while you cough or sneeze. Treat your wounds immediately and clean surfaces frequently. TREATMENT If someone is diagnosed with STSS, they need to be admitted to the hospital immediately. Standard treatment of shock and organ failure such as fluid resuscitation, is given. As per the diagnosis, STSS is treated with antibiotics. Many people might also need surgery to remove the infected tissue."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Sickle cell disease is a genetic blood disorder that affects the shape of the red blood cells and further compromises life expectancy. In the Union Budget 2023-24, a mission to eliminate sickle cell anemia by 2047 was announced, focusing on awareness and screening programs for people from ages 0 to 40 years. In India, the disease is more common in the tribal population but occurs in non-tribals as well. In sickle cell disease, a person's red blood cells become \"sickle\" in shape because of a genetic condition. Because of this, the blood cells cannot bend or easily flow throughout the body. As of now, there is no treatment for sickle cell disease. However, doctors prescribe medications and other treatment options, which are lifelong, to manage the symptoms. On World Sickle Cell Day, here's all you need to know about the disease. WHAT IS SICKLE CELL DISEASE? Sickle cell disease is a genetic blood disorder that affects the shape of red blood cells. Normally, red blood cells are round and flexible, but in sickle cell disease, they become stiff and crescent-shaped, resembling a sickle. Sickle cell disease is a genetic blood disorder that affects the shape of red blood cells. (Photo: Getty Images) This abnormal shape makes it difficult for these cells to travel smoothly through blood vessels, leading to blockages and various health problems. It is caused by a mutation in the gene that tells the body how to make hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Both parents must pass down the defective gene for a child to develop the disease . If a person inherits the gene from just one parent, they have sickle cell trait and can pass the gene to their children but usually do not experience symptoms. SYMPTOMS OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE DIAGNOSIS Sickle cell disease is usually diagnosed through a blood test. Newborns are routinely screened for the disease in many countries. The test checks for the presence of hemoglobin S, the defective form of hemoglobin that causes sickle cell disease. TREATMENT While there is no universal cure for sickle cell disease, treatments can help manage symptoms and reduce complications. INDIA'S ELIMINATION STRATEGY Despite several efforts by the public and private bodies, patients still face challenges due to limited healthcare access, especially in remote areas where stigma is associated with the disease. On World Sickle Cell Day, Union Tribal Affairs Minister Jual Oram shared a message about the awareness of the disease in the tribal areas. Message of Union Minister for Tribal Affairs Shri @jualoram on the Eve of World #SickleCell Awareness Day. pic.twitter.com/0yeE7lmlaf — PIB Tribal Affairs (@PIB_MoTA) June 18, 2024 According to the Health Ministry, more than 1 crore people have been screened for sickle cell disease under the National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission. The mission was launched last year to screen more than 7 crore people between 0-40 years in the affected tribal areas."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Early in the pandemic, many people infected with SARS-CoV-2 or Covid-19 reported persistent symptoms lasting a month or more, much longer than typical for an upper respiratory viral infection, or developed new, lingering symptoms after recovery. While the exact causes of post-Covid-19 conditions, or \"long Covid,\" remain unclear, a recent study by researchers at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons confirms the significant impact of long Covid and identifies those at highest risk. The study, published in JAMA Network Open , reveals that individuals with milder infections, including those vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 and those infected with the Omicron variant, tended to recover more quickly. Recovery times were similar for subsequent infections. \"Our study highlights the crucial role of Covid vaccination , not just in reducing infection severity but also in lowering the risk of long Covid,\" said Elizabeth C. Oelsner, the study’s lead author and Herbert Irving Associate Professor of Medicine. MORE ABOUT THE STUDY The research involved over 4,700 participants from the Collaborative Cohort of Cohorts for COVID-19 Research (C4R), who reported their recovery time after SARS-CoV-2 infection. From 2020 to early 2023, the median recovery time post-infection was 20 days, with over one in five adults not recovering within three months . Women and adults with pre-pandemic cardiovascular disease were less likely to recover within three months. Women and adults with pre-pandemic cardiovascular disease were less likely to recover within three months. (Photo: Getty Images) Other pre-pandemic health conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes, asthma, chronic lung disease, depressive symptoms, and smoking history, were initially linked to longer recovery times. However, these links became insignificant after considering sex, cardiovascular disease, vaccination , and variant exposure. \"Despite suggestions that long Covid patients often face mental health challenges, our study found that pre-infection depressive symptoms were not a major risk factor for long Covid,\" Oelsner noted. Besides this, American Indian and Alaska Native participants were disproportionately affected by long Covid, experiencing more severe infections and longer recovery times. \"Our study clearly shows that long Covid poses a significant personal and societal burden,\" said Oelsner. \"By identifying those likely to experience prolonged recovery, we can better target ongoing studies aimed at reducing or preventing the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Women diagnosed with perinatal depression are significantly more likely to develop heart disease within 20 years of giving birth compared to those who haven't experienced perinatal depression, according to new research. Perinatal depression, which occurs during pregnancy or after childbirth, affects approximately one in five women globally. This study, published in the European Heart Journal , examined cardiovascular health following perinatal depression, using data from about 6,00,000 women. It found the strongest associations with risks of high blood pressure, ischemic heart disease , and heart failure. The research, led by Dr Emma Bränn, Dr Donghao Lu, and their team at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, builds on previous findings linking perinatal depression to other health issues, including premenstrual disorders, autoimmune conditions, suicidal behaviour, and premature death. \"Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and there's been ongoing discussion about incorporating reproductive health into risk assessments for women,\" said Dr. Lu. \"We wanted to determine if a history of perinatal depression could help predict cardiovascular disease risk,\" the author of the study added. Perinatal depression, which occurs during pregnancy or after childbirth, affects approximately one in five women globally. (Photo: Getty Images) Using the Swedish Medical Birth Register, which records all births in Sweden, the researchers compared 55,539 women diagnosed with perinatal depression between 2001 and 2014 with 545,567 women who gave birth during the same period but did not have perinatal depression. All participants were monitored until 2020 for the development of cardiovascular disease . The study found that 6.4% of women with perinatal depression developed cardiovascular disease, compared to 3.7% of those without. This indicates a 36% higher risk for those with perinatal depression. Specifically, the risk of high blood pressure was about 50% higher, ischemic heart disease 37% higher, and heart failure 36% higher. \"Our findings could help identify individuals at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, allowing for preventative measures,\" said Dr. Bränn, the study's senior author. Researchers also compared women with perinatal depression to their sisters, finding a 20% higher risk of cardiovascular disease, suggesting potential genetic or familial factors."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Air pollution is impacting human health heavily, becoming the second leading risk factor for death globally. The State of Global Air (SoGA) 2024 report was released on Wednesday, which shows that in 2021, air pollution accounted for 8.1 million deaths globally, including more than 7,00,000 children under five years old. The report, released by the Health Effects Institute (HEI), an independent US-based non-profit research organisation, in partnership with UNICEF, found that children under 5 are particularly affected, with over 2,60,600 dying from pollution-related causes in South Asia, where it is the second-leading cause of death after malnutrition. The effects of improving air quality and energy access have led to progress, with child mortality rates linked to pollution dropping by 53% since 2000. Despite these advances, the report underscores an urgent need for further action to prevent air pollution from threatening health and well-being, particularly in younger and vulnerable populations. The effects of improving air quality and energy access have led to progress, with child mortality rates linked to pollution dropping by 53% since 2000. (Photo: Generative AI by Vani Gupta/India Today) In 2021, India saw the highest total number of deaths in children under 5 due to air pollution worldwide. The good news is that the number of deaths in children under 5 linked to air pollution is decreasing over time. Levels of ozone, a secondary pollutant, and deaths due to ozone are increasing over time. In 2000, exposure to ozone was linked to 93,000 deaths, while in 2021, exposure to ozone was linked to 2,72,000 deaths in India. As per the report, countries in South Asia, East West Central and South Africa experience the largest burden of disease linked to air pollution. (Credit: UNICEF) With a population of over 1 billion each, India has seen 2.1 million deaths and China 2.3 million deaths. Together they account for 54% of the total global disease burden. In 2021 nearly 50% (2,37,000 deaths) of all ozone-related COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) deaths were in India, followed by China with 1,25,600 deaths and Bangladesh with 15,000 deaths. The proportion of the population experiencing high ozone exposure is increasing in many regions of the world including India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Brazil, which have experienced increases of more than 10% in ambient ozone exposure in the last decade."

The guidelines, published by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), provide a detailed list of dos and don'ts to help the public stay safe. DOs AND DON'Ts AMID HEATWAVE Avoid peak hours People are advised to stay indoors between 12 pm and 3 pm, the hottest part of the day, to reduce the risk of heat stress and exhaustion. Stay hydrated Even if you don’t feel thirsty , drink water frequently. Always carry water when traveling to ensure you stay hydrated. Appropriate clothing Wear lightweight, light-coloured, loose-fitting, and porous cotton clothes. Protect yourself with goggles, umbrellas or hats, and proper footwear when stepping out in the sun. Avoid strenuous activities Refrain from engaging in vigorous activities, especially during peak heat hours between 12 pm and 3 pm. People are advised to stay indoors between 12 pm and 3 pm, the hottest part of the day, to reduce the risk of heat stress and exhaustion. (Photo: PTI) Dietary advice Avoid alcohol, tea, coffee, and carbonated drinks as they can cause dehydration. Instead, drink ORS (oral rehydration solution), homemade drinks like lassi, torani (rice water), lemon water, and buttermilk to stay hydrated. Maintain a healthy diet but avoid high-protein foods and stale food during hot weather. Cool your body Use fans, wear damp clothing, and take frequent baths with cold water to keep your body cool. Keep your home cool by using curtains, shutters, or sunshades, and open windows at night to allow cooler air to circulate. Safety for children and pets Never leave children or pets in parked vehicles. Ensure animals have access to shade and plenty of water. Seek medical attention If you feel like you're going to faint or feeling unwell, consult a doctor immediately.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Lifting heavy weights three times a week around retirement age can significantly maintain leg strength well into later life, according to new research. As people age, they naturally lose muscle function. Experts say declining leg strength is a strong indicator of mortality in elderly individuals. While earlier studies hinted that resistance training might help, the new research provides robust evidence. Researchers from the University of Copenhagen found that one year of heavy resistance training around retirement age preserves vital leg strength for years. \"In well-functioning older adults at retirement age, one year of heavy resistance training may induce long-lasting beneficial effects by preserving muscle function,\" they reported in BMJ Open Sport and Exercise Medicine . The study involved 451 participants from the Live Active Successful Ageing (Lisa) study, a large randomised controlled trial. Participants were divided into three groups: one did heavy resistance training , another did moderate-intensity training, and the third did no extra exercise beyond their usual activities. The heavy weights group lifted weights three times a week, performing three sets of six to 12 repetitions at 70% to 85% of their maximum capacity. The moderate group did circuit training with body weight exercises and resistance bands. Results showed that those in the heavy weights group maintained their leg strength over time. (Photo: Getty Images) Researchers measured bone and muscle strength, and body fat levels at the start, and then again after one, two, and four years. At the four-year mark, complete data was available for 369 people. By the study's end, the average age was 71, with 61% being women. Results showed that those in the heavy weights group maintained their leg strength over time , while those in the moderate and no exercise groups lost strength. The preservation of leg strength in the heavy weights group may be due to nervous system changes in response to resistance training. The study noted that participants were generally more active than the average population, walking nearly 10,000 steps a day, so they may not represent the general population. \"This study provides evidence that resistance training with heavy loads at retirement age can have long-term effects over several years,\" the researchers concluded."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story With extreme heat gripping much of the Northern Hemisphere this week, authorities and public health experts have issued heat warnings to help keep people safe. Parts of China, India, the Middle East, southern Europe and the United States are bracing for the possibility of new record highs. WHAT ARE THE HEALTH RISKS? Heat affects health in several ways. Heat exhaustion, which can include dizziness, headaches, shaking and thirst , can affect anyone, and is not usually serious, providing the person cools down within 30 minutes. The more serious version is heatstroke, when the body's core temperature goes above 40.6 degrees Celsius (105 degrees Fahrenheit). It is a medical emergency and can lead to long-term organ damage and death. Symptoms include rapid breathing, confusion or seizures, and nausea. Heat exhaustion, which can include dizziness, headaches, shaking and thirst, can affect anyone, and is not usually serious, providing the person cools down within 30 minutes. (Photo: PTI) As climate change continues to drive temperatures upward in coming years, the danger of humidity is also expected to rise. Warmer air can hold more moisture. And more moisture in the air makes it harder for people to sweat to cool down. WHO IS AT RISK? Some people are more vulnerable, including young babies and older people, as well as people who must stay active or are more exposed, such as homeless people. Existing conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases , as well as diabetes, can also heighten risk - and be exacerbated by heat. Many countries do not record heat as a specific cause of death, which means we do not have statistics to gauge this risk on communities. However, a 2021 study, in The Lancet estimated that just under a half-million deaths can be attributed to excess heat every year - a conservative count that lacks data from many low-income countries. Many in Europe fear a repeat of the 2022 summer, during which heatwaves killed an estimated 61,000 people, scientists said. The risks will continue to rise as climate change pushes global temperatures even higher in coming decades. LESS OBVIOUS RISKS Apart from testing a body's internal thermostat, extreme heat can pose a host of other, secondary risks. Warmer temperatures encourage the growth of bacteria and algae. So heatwaves can raise the risk of water being contaminated with diseases like cholera, or of water bodies becoming choked with toxic algae. Heat can also damage crops, adding to concerns about food security. Starting from 2030, experts expect that global death tolls will increase by 250,000 per year as a result of four climate-related health risks: heat stress, malnutrition associated with food insecurity, malaria, and diarrhoea, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Heat can also damage crops, adding to concerns about food security. (Photo: Getty Images) Wildfires fueled by dried-out trees or shrubs can lead to dangerous levels of air pollution, which can cause lung inflammation and tissue damage. Studies have also suggested that both extreme heat as well as exposure to wildfire smoke could also be linked with low birthweight and premature births. Heat stress can also contribute to poorer mental health. Rising night-time temperatures can disrupt, people's sleep patterns, worsening mental health outcomes. TIMING MATTERS Experts say more deaths occur earlier in the summer when people's bodies have not had a chance to acclimatise to the season. Location matters, too; people are at higher risk in places where they are not used to such heat, including parts of Europe. As outdoor work becomes dangerous amid high temperatures, some countries and communities have shuttered schools or forced a shortening of daytime work hours for businesses. WHAT YOU CAN DO Public health agencies from India to the United States have issued advice on keeping cool, including avoiding exertion where possible and staying hydrated. Authorities often aim to help by setting up cooling centers, distributing extra water or providing free access to air-conditioned public transport. Workers should think about having more breaks and changing their clothing too, scientists said. It is important to check in on the vulnerable, including older and isolated people, they said. Heatstroke is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional attention."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Infertility has become a public health concern worldwide, witnessing a rising trend among couples. While there are several factors causing infertility, one of the major reasons remains - sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) have become quite prevalent in men, impacting their fertility . These infections, transmitted during any sexual activity, can significantly impact overall well-being. STDs can manifest differently in men. These diseases are caused by bacteria and viruses that thrive in moist and warm conditions, and the transmission can occur through contact with vaginal fluid, semen, blood, or skin-to-skin contact with an infected person. Doctors have suggested regular screening to detect any STD early and provide immediate treatment to avoid the spreading of infections. Dr Ravindra Hodarkar, Urologist at Zynova Shalby Hospital, explained various STDs and their symptoms: Chlamydia: A bacterial infection transmitted through anal, oral, or vaginal sex, causing penile discharge, swollen testicles, and painful urination. Gonorrhea: Affects the anus, throat, or urethra, leading to painful urination and penile discharge. Hepatitis A: Spread through unprotected sexual contact, causing fever and fatigue. Hepatitis B: Transmitted through contact with infected blood or bodily fluids, resulting in nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and jaundice. Chlamydia is a bacterial infection transmitted sexual contact. (Photo: Getty Images) Herpes: A viral condition caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), leading to blisters on the genitals, lips, tongue, and gums. Human papillomavirus (HPV): Causes genital warts and warts in the mouth and throat. Syphilis: A bacterial STI causing skin rash, tiredness, and headache. HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus): Transmitted via bodily fluids, with symptoms including fever, rash, sore throat, headache, cough, diarrhea, and weight loss. Dr. Hodarkar emphasised the importance of regular screenings and early detection to prevent long-term effects such as infertility, prostate and throat cancer, genital ulcers, and organ damage. Dr Rajesh Bendre, National Technical Head & Chief Pathologist at Apollo Diagnostics, Mumbai, highlighted the importance of diagnosis as STDs can impact mental health. \"STDs can severely impact mental health, leading to depression, stress, anxiety, and loneliness. Consult a doctor who can diagnose and treat the infection. Diagnosis involves a physical examination, oral swab, blood tests, and swabs from the penis and genital sores,\" said Dr Bendre. Bacterial STDs are treatable with antibiotics, but viral infections like herpes and HIV are not curable. Preventive measures include practising safe sex and avoiding sharing personal items. The doctors underscored that STDs are a serious health concern for men. Awareness, regular screening, and prompt treatment are vital to managing and preventing these infections."

REDUCE STRESS Prakriti Poddar, Global head of Mental Health and Wellbeing for Roundglass Living app, highlighted how yoga has been a \"transformative practice which has fuelled my personal growth and expanded my conscience.\" \"Yoga activates the parasympathetic nervous system, taking you out of the stress-inducing 'fight or flight' mode. It cultivates spiritual well-being and mindfulness, which boosts your mental reserves to deal with stress,\" Poddar said. Yoga provides movement, relaxes muscles and joints and helps improve the quality of life. (Photo: Getty Images) Yoga expert Krupa Shah added that yoga serves as a powerful bridge between the mind and body, creating \"a deep sense of self-awareness, self-confidence, and self-motivation.\" Nadi shodhana pranayama (alternate nostril breathing) is fantastic for relieving anxiety and stress and clearing out energy blockages, Poddar said. IMPROVES FOCUS Meditation or dhyana, is one of the eight limbs of yoga and it helps cultivate inner calm and stillness. \"It has the power to restructure the brain by increasing grey matter in the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with executive functions, like decision-making, focus and planning,\" Poddar explained. Slower pranayamas (breathing exercises) deliver more oxygen to the blood and brain, calming the nervous system, aiding detoxification, and sharpening focus.

(Photo: Getty Images) Krupa Shah added that breathing exercises, a core aspect of yoga, play a crucial role in activating brain cells, leading to improved memory and learning. \"The practice of yoga strengthens the brain’s capacity for better attention and awareness,\" she said. DEEP SLEEP One of the major markers of having troubled mental health is the lack of deep sleep. Experts highlighted how certain asanas in yoga can calm the body down and induce sleep. Yoga nidra (yogic sleep) and shavasana (corpse pose) have the power to induce deep states of relaxation and help you sleep better. (Photo: Getty Images) \"Yoga nidra (yogic sleep) and shavasana (corpse pose) have the power to induce deep states of relaxation and help you sleep better. As you intentionally relax each part of your body, your sympathetic nervous system calms down, and the body releases melatonin, the sleep hormone, making it easy to get a restful sleep,\" Poddar said. PHYSICAL WELL-BEING In its latest guidelines, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) suggested yoga as an important activity to stay physically and mentally fit. \"Yoga is a holistic, structured and planned physical activity that also includes breathing exercises (pranayama) as well as physical and mental relaxation (meditation),\" the guidelines read. As per ICMR, yoga asanas can help increase the depth and frequency of breathing, further increasing flexibility of joints and making the muscles active. \"Certain yoga postures (asanas) combined with breathing exercises are known to speed up the metabolism and help burn fat and facilitate weight loss,\" as per the guidelines."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Every individual has access to modern medicine today. Though it helps cure medical ailments by repairing disturbed machinery, it has been unable to look into the subtle dimensions of the human personality. That’s where the concept of holistic medicine came in. The principle of holistic health, a very old one in India, aimed at covering the physical, mental, spiritual and social well-being of the patient. Unfortunately, the last century saw a gradual disappearance of this approach due to the overwhelming impact of Western medical science. Though the modern era has added a lot of comfort to our lives, it has brought with it a heavy baggage of lifestyle diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, arthritis, digestive disorders and, above all, cancer. Globally, over 14 million people are afflicted with cancer, and it is considered to be the second-largest killer. It is a known fact that 30-50 per cent of cancer can be averted just by resorting to a healthy lifestyle. The sedentary nature of work, lack of physical activity, undue stress, and negative emotions have all been scientifically proven to be the causation of this deadly disease. In fact, there is mounting evidence that raised levels of stress hormones like catecholamines and cortisol induce cancer. Studies have also shown that chronic stress enhances the metastatic potential of this disease, thereby reducing the overall quality of life of the patient and survival. Cancer is known to initiate a vicious cascade. If the disease has a relationship with stress in its causation, cancer can lead to fear, depression, anxiety and panic. According to various studies, every fourth cancer patient is known to ask for psychological support. This is where the mind-body techniques practised and yoga come into play. To date, there are more than 100 Randomised Controlled Clinical Trials (RCT) and uncontrolled trials that state yoga's benefit or therapeutic effects on cancer patients. Yoga has been prevalent in our country for some 4000 years. Though it was being followed in different parts of the world, the system found its fullest expression only in India. According to medical scientists, yoga therapy has been successful in treating various medical conditions because of the balance that it creates between the nervous and the endocrine systems. It is through these yogic practices one can reduce one’s stress and maintain a healthy balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic arousal. The various body movements, poses, meditation and breathing exercises help bring a perfect harmony between the body and mind. Meta-analysis of patients with breast cancer who performed yoga has shown improved scores with respect to their functional, social and spiritual well-being. Positive moods, reduced negative thoughts, lowered hostility and increased enthusiasm were appreciable changes in the people who practised the art. While yoga for pediatric cancer patients have been incorporated for increasing their strength, balance , pain and quality of life. A study from the Seattle Children’s Hospital showed that a five weekly yoga class spread over a two-month period improves the physical function of children hospitalised with cancer. In fact, yoga proved to be therapeutic, creating joyful and positive emotions, thereby stimulating the child’s activity, mobility, and participation despite chronic illness. Though yoga may not provide cure for cancer patients but it is certain that it alleviates agony, helps them cope with stress, adding quality and meaning to their life. It is priceless, inexpensive and requires no infrastructure or maintenance. When coupled with lifestyle changes which include regular exercises and dietary modifications, yoga has proved efficacious and has stood the test of time in harmonising the body, mind and soul. It is true that the choices we make in our lives define our journey. To beat the stress of life, the most powerful tool is self - motivation. The two words which can change the way we walk on this journey are “can I?” or “I can”. By choosing the right option, one can create a difference in one’s own living. One should also understand that the day we plant the seed, is not the day we eat the fruit. So, the best philosophy in life is to keep the mind happy. We don’t know whether success gives happiness or not, but a happy mind will always lead to success.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Drugs used to combat HIV and Aids are now being tested in the treatment of multiple brain tumours. Scientists at the Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence at the University of Plymouth are conducting a clinical trial to see if anti-retroviral medications Ritonavir and Lopinavir can help people with Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2). NF2 is a rare genetic condition that causes tumours like schwannomas (including acoustic neuromas), ependymomas, and meningiomas to develop on the brain's membrane. The RETREAT clinical trial, led by Professor Oliver Hanemann, builds on research by Dr Sylwia Ammoun and Professor Hanemann, whose research showed that these repurposed drugs could reduce tumour growth and survival. In the year-long trial, patients will have a tumour biopsy and blood test before taking the medications for 30 days. Afterwards, they will have another biopsy and blood test to check if the drugs have entered the tumour cells and worked as intended. NF2 is a rare genetic condition that causes tumours like schwannomas (including acoustic neuromas), ependymomas, and meningiomas to develop on the brain's membrane. (Photo: Getty Images) Professor Oliver Hanemann, Director of the Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence at the University of Plymouth, said, “This could be the first step toward a systemic treatment for NF2-related tumours, both for those who inherited NF2 and those with a one-off NF2 mutation.\" If successful and expanded into a larger clinical trial, it would be a significant breakthrough for patients with this condition, who currently have no effective treatment. \"Using repurposed drugs like Ritonavir and Lopinavir is promising because they already have a strong safety record in people treated for HIV, allowing for a quicker transition from the lab to patient treatment,\" said Dr Karen Noble, Director of Research, Policy, and Innovation at Brain Tumour Research. A participant of the clinical trial, Jayne Sweeney, 57, from Cornwall, UK, said how the study gives hope to people who have been living with NF2. In 1985, Jayne became deaf in her left ear following an operation to remove the tumour located there. She was monitored with regular scans, on the expectation she required no further treatment, but the tumour regrew. \"The loss of hearing is the worst thing about having NF2 because it’s very isolating and frustrating,\" she said, adding, \"I had 15 months’ chemotherapy, and radiotherapy in January this year. Radiotherapy is so barbaric; having four anaesthetic injections into my head was the most painful thing I’ve ever experienced, so finding better and kinder ways to treat the disease is so important.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Climate change is one of the biggest public health threats ever, and global warming is a significant part of this. Rising temperatures are linked to health problems, especially in vulnerable groups like pregnant women and children. There's growing evidence of how heat exposure can increase the risk of premature babies and stillbirth (when a fetus dies after the 20th week of pregnancy). Recent studies are now finding more worrying connections between heat and poor outcomes for mothers and babies, including congenital abnormalities, pregnancy hypertension, and low birth weight. A new study, published in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth , found the long-term effect of heat exposure during pregnancy on the baby. A systematic review of existing research showed how heat exposure in pregnancy affects health and socioeconomic outcomes later in life. Systematic reviews provide high-quality medical evidence by summarising findings from multiple studies instead of relying on just one. A systematic review of existing research showed how heat exposure in pregnancy affects health and socioeconomic outcomes later in life. (Photo: Getty Images) The study found that excessive heat exposure before birth can have serious lifelong effects. WHAT ARE THE LIFELONG EFFECTS? Here's how heat exposure during pregnancy affects unborn babies: In an article published in The Conversation, the authors of the study, Matthew Chersich and Darshnika Pemi Lakhoo, and contributor Nicholas Brink, from the University of Witwatersrand, stated that they reviewed 29 studies spanning over 100 years, revealing effects across a person's lifespan. Some studies followed pregnancies closely to observe child health outcomes, while others used population registries to estimate in-utero heat exposure. Over 60% of the studies were from high-income countries with cooler climates, relying on naturally occurring heat differences rather than controlled trials. Most studies found harmful long-term effects from increased heat exposure during pregnancy, including worse educational performance and lower income later in life. (Photo: Getty Images) Despite limitations, most studies found harmful long-term effects from increased heat exposure during pregnancy , including worse educational performance and lower income later in life. For instance, in the US, annual income at age 30 was reduced by $56 (2008 equivalent) for every additional day with temperatures above 32 degrees Celsius during the mother’s first trimester. The researchers also found increased risks of heart disease, hypertension, childhood asthma, and pneumonia. Childhood pneumonia risks rose by 85% for every 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature during pregnancy . In Africa, heat exposure in pregnancy was linked to higher child malnutrition risks. In the US, one study linked it to a higher risk of obesity. Many studies also found links to mental illnesses, such as eating disorders and schizophrenia. Previous research has associated birth month with mental illness risk, and our findings suggest heat exposure could be a factor. Overall, people exposed to increased heat in the womb tended to have lower life expectancy and worse effects for female fetuses in some studies. \"There is an urgent need to conduct more research into this area and explore how and why these effects occur,\" the authors said. The researchers admitted even though the results are \"limited\", \"our findings are concerning and support immediate action to protect pregnant women and their unborn babies from heat.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Lower back pains have become a common occurrence, especially in people to sit for a prolonged period of time. A new study has shown that about 70% of people who recover from low back pain will have another episode within a year. Recurrent low back pain places a heavy burden on both individuals and the healthcare system. The study, published in The Lancet , shows that a program combining walking and education can help reduce the recurrence of low back pain. In the study, 701 adults who had recently recovered from low back pain were randomly assigned to either an individualised walking and education program (intervention) or no treatment (control). Those in the intervention group received guidance from physiotherapists over six sessions in six months. The first, third, and fifth sessions focused on creating a personalised walking plan tailored to each person's needs and preferences. Recurrent low back pain places a heavy burden on both individuals and the healthcare system. (Photo: Getty Images) The remaining sessions were short check-ins to monitor progress and address any issues. Due to the Covid pandemic, most sessions were conducted via telehealth. The program aimed for participants to walk five times a week for about 30 minutes each day by the end of six months . They were also encouraged to keep walking after the program ended. Education provided by the physiotherapists during the sessions helped participants understand pain better, reduce fear of exercise, and gain confidence in managing minor recurrences. The control group received no preventative treatment or education, which is typical after recovering from an episode of low back pain. WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY? Participants were monitored monthly for up to three years to track any new episodes of low back pain and related costs, such as time off work and healthcare services. The intervention reduced the risk of recurring low back pain that limited daily activities by 28%, and the recurrence of pain requiring professional care by 43%. Those in the intervention group also had a longer pain-free period, with a median of 208 days compared to 112 days for the control group. The program proved cost-effective, mainly due to less work absenteeism and reduced use of health services among the intervention group. The study had some limitations. Most participants were female, aged 43 to 66, and well-educated, which may limit the findings to a niche audience. Additionally, physiotherapists in the study were trained in health coaching, so it's unclear if the same results would be achieved with other clinicians. BENEFITS OF WALKING FOR LOWER BACK PAIN Why is walking helpful for low back pain? The exact reasons are unknown, but it may involve gentle movements, strengthening spinal structures and muscles, relaxation, stress relief, and the release of endorphins that block pain signals. Other low-cost exercises like swimming might also help prevent back pain, but no studies have investigated this yet. Preventing low back pain is challenging, but these findings give hope that we're getting closer to a solution, one step at a time."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) has played a crucial role in reproductive medicine, offering hope to couples grappling with infertility. Infertility is a major public health problem in India and worldwide. As per the World Health Organisation (WHO), infertility is a disease of the male or female reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. WHAT IS IVF? IVF involves retrieving eggs from the female partner and fertilising them with sperm in a laboratory. When male infertility is a factor, ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) is employed, wherein a single healthy sperm is directly injected into an egg, increasing the likelihood of fertilisation. This technique bypasses many hurdles that sperm face in natural conception, such as swimming through the female reproductive tract and penetrating the egg. WHY IS THERE A HIGH RATE OF MALE INFERTILITY? While female infertility has long been a focus in reproductive health, the past few years have seen a significant rise in male infertility rates. IVF involves retrieving eggs from the female partner and fertilising them with sperm in a laboratory. (Photo: Getty Images) Caused by low sperm count, poor sperm motility, or abnormal sperm morphology, the rising rates of male infertility have been linked to more environmental and lifestyle factors than genetic factors. Dr Duru Shah, Director at Gynaecworld and a consultant at Breach Candy and Jaslok Hospitals, highlighted smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, and advanced paternal age as significant contributors. \"Cigarette smoking is a known hazard, affecting sperm motility, count, and morphology . Chronic alcohol intake impairs normal sperm development and also adds to sexual dysfunction,\" said Dr Shah told IndiaToday.In. Dr KD Nayar, Chief Consultant and HOD at Akanksha IVF Centre, said that the male factor has gone up to 50%, making fertility a bigger problem among couples. Environmental factors include exposure to toxins, pesticides and heavy metals that are known to impair spermatogenesis. Research indicates that men exposed to high levels of environmental pollutants had significantly lower sperm quality and higher rates of infertility. Studies have shown that heat stress can lead to a temporary reduction in sperm count and motility. Dr Archana Dhawan Bajaj, gynaecologist and IVF expert at Nurture IVF Clinic in New Delhi, explained, \"When treating male infertility, IVF is sometimes the best course of action. If an examination of the semen indicates that there is very little normal sperm present, IVF is advised to combat infertility in men.\" The expert highlighted the efficacy of IVF, particularly in cases where multiple fertility-related issues exist, such as low sperm count combined with blocked tubes, ovulation difficulties, or advanced maternal age. \"IVF can still be performed to fertilise eggs with sperm with low motility. Fertilisation may be regulated in the lab by putting the sperm and egg close together in a petri dish, which reduces the distance the insufficiently motile sperm must travel to reach the egg,\" said Dr Bajaj. HOW CAN IVF HELP? IVF allows the use of sperm retrieved through various methods, including testicular sperm extraction (TESE), where sperm is directly obtained from the testes in cases of azoospermia (absence of sperm in the ejaculate). Dr Shah emphasised the transformative impact of IVF and ICSI on male infertility. \"With IVF, fertilisation can be achieved in a petri dish, wherein one oocyte (egg) is left to fertilise with almost 50,000 sperms. But with the discovery of ICSI in 1992, even severe forms of male infertility can now be treated successfully,\" she said. While female infertility has long been a focus in reproductive health, the past few years have seen a significant rise in male infertility rates. (Photo: Getty Images) As per the expert, IVF or ICSI have an almost 40-50% success rate, per cycle depending on the high-risk factors of both the partners. Besides this, Dr Shah stressed the importance of understanding the mental and emotional factors that men undergo during infertility issues. “We must also consider the fact that men tend to feel threatened when they are diagnosed with infertility. Understanding their mental and emotional factors during the infertility journey is also something which shouldn’t be ignored,” said Dr Shah. CHALLENGES OF IVF IN INDIA While IVF offers hope, numerous challenges in India make accessibility and affordability significant hurdles, turning it into a daunting reproductive option for many couples. IVF or ICSI have an almost 40-50% success rate, per cycle depending on the high-risk factors of both the partners. (Photo: Getty Images) Dr Shah pointed out that although urban areas are \"mushroomed with fertility clinics,\" rural areas still struggle with easy accessibility to fertility treatments. \"The stigma associated with infertility contributes to depression, anxiety, and failed relationships,\" added Dr Shah. Dr Nayar added that since every cost of IVF varies from Rs 80,000 to Rs 2.5 lakh, the procedure has become quite inaccessible and unaffordable for most couples, especially because of India’s low per capita income. He added that introducing IVF in medical colleges in India can help increase accessibility. Both Dr Nayar and Dr Shah advocated for insurance coverage as well and urged better government regulation and standardisation of IVF clinics. By facilitating fertilisation, IVF addresses high infertility rates in men, providing a viable pathway to parenthood and alleviating the emotional and social burdens associated with infertility if challenges in this are met promptly."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story On June 4, the Bharatiya Janata Party, projected to gain a resounding mandate by pollsters, pundits, and the party itself, failed to make a simple majority in the Lok Sabha. It fell short by 32 seats, winning only 240 seats this time — a loss of 63 seats compared to 2019. The National Democratic Alliance won 293 seats. On the other hand, the Opposition, INDIA, did much better than initially expected. The 2024 verdict ushered India back into the coalition era. The BJP now will have to keep in humour its two key allies, the Janata Dal (United)’s Nitish Kumar and the Telugu Desam Party’s N Chandrababu Naidu. How could a leader of Narendra Modi’s popularity, who boasted the BJP crossing 370 seats, not take BJP past the halfway mark? This election is a classic case study of how the Opposition, which looked disunited and unprepared, could mount such a huge challenge. Gains and losses The BJP had maxed out in the northern and western parts of India, winning 81 and 65 per cent of the seats respectively in 2019. Its allies won 14 and 23 per cent respectively in these regions. The saffron party expected losses in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Jharkhand either because of maxing out or because of the fierce challenge posed by the Opposition. The BJP hoped to make up for these losses in West Bengal and Odisha in the east, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in the south, and Uttar Pradesh in the north. It hoped to recoup these seats riding on the inauguration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The Prime Minister also ran a spirited campaign in Tamil Nadu and Kerala in hopes of opening the BJP’s accounts in these southern states. In 2014 as well, the BJP had maxed out in north and west India. In 2019, it lost 34 or 12 per cent of the 282 seats it had won in 2014, including seats reallocated to allies. These as well could be attributed to maxing out and can be classified as natural losses. These were compensated majorly by the 55 seats it gained primarily in West Bengal (+16), Odisha (+7), Karnataka (+8), Haryana (3), and Telangana (3). Going by the 2019 trend, the BJP should have lost 12 per cent of its 303-seat tally in 2024, that is 37 seats, which could then be compensated by other states mentioned above. Worst case scenario, even with no gains, it would then have landed 266 seats, which is close to a majority. But the BJP’s tally declined by 86 seats (on a net basis) across states as shown above, almost 50 more than it should have, going by the 2014-19 trend. It should have gained 20 per cent of seats of the base tally of 303, which is around 60 seats. However, it’s tally improved by just 23 seats (on a net basis) across states, less than half required to compensate for expected losses. Instead of improving the tally from target states UP and West Bengal, it suffered a decline here, compounding the problem. The party won 12 seats in Odisha (in simultaneous polls where it won the Vidhan Sabha polls as well), four in Telangana at the expense of the Bharat Rashtra Samithi, and three in Andhra Pradesh, piggybacking ally TDP’s performance in state elections, which it won handsomely. In terms of losses, the biggest loss of 29 seats came from UP, including the Ayodhya seat (Faizabad). In Bengal, the BJP lost six seats to a feisty Mamata Banerjee. In Haryana, it lost five seats to Jat anger. In Bihar, it lost five seats to a resurrected Opposition. In Maharashtra, it lost a whopping 14 seats as voters rejected the BJP’s jod-tod politics. In Rajasthan, it lost 10 seats due to Rajput anger and ticket mismanagement. In Karnataka, it lost eight seats because of the Siddaramaiah government’s welfare policies. In Jharkhand, it lost three seats due to sympathy generated for Hemant Soren after his arrest. In terms of vote share, the party lost massive vote share (-5 per cent and more) in UP, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Manipur, and Rajasthan, while gaining in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. In 2014, BJP won 25 per cent of its tally from UP, and in 2019, 20 per cent. In 2024, the corresponding number was just 14 per cent. If the party had maintained its tally in UP, it would have won 269 seats (3 short of majority). BJP-Congress fights In 2019, the BJP won 175 of the 190 direct contest seats against the Congress, a strike rate of 92 per cent. The Congress won only 15. In 2024, the direct contests increased to 215. These seats were majorly in UP, Telangana, Maharashtra etc. Of these, the BJP won 153 (-22), a strike rate of 71 per cent. The Congress 62 (+47). This had a direct bearing on the results, with Congress almost doubling its tally to 99 (+47) and pulling down the BJP tally below the majority mark."

Even as Pawan acknowledged Modi's generous encomiums, the moment was proof that the actor celebrated with the moniker of ‘Power Star’ had finally stamped his presence on the Power Map of Andhra Pradesh and India. Though Modi had played on the word ‘Pawan’, the interesting fact is that ‘Pawan’ was not the name given to him by his parents. He was originally Kalyan Babu, younger brother to Varaprasad Rao (who then took the screen name of Chiranjeevi) and Nagababu. ‘Pawan’ was the title awarded to him after a martial arts event and that became his screen name when he made his debut in Telugu films in 1996 with ‘ Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi ’. Pawan Kalyan holds a black belt in karate and is known to do most stunts himself without using a body double. Not only that. For a person who was self-professedly not academically brilliant and has spoken frankly about his failures at school, Pawan scored 100 per cent in the elections of 2024. He won all the 21 assembly seats and the two Lok Sabha seats his Jana Sena party contested. It was a glorious comeback because just five years ago, he had been ridiculed after he himself lost from both the assembly constituencies of Gajuwaka and Bhimavaram that he contested. If politics were Tollywood, Pawan had made the most Mass of Mass entries. Why was Pawan Kalyan so important in the move to dethrone YS Jagan Mohan Reddy from the seat of power in Andhra Pradesh? To put it simply, he was the catalyst that brought disparate and reluctant elements together to create a political explosion in the electoral lab. Like in sports, if one were to pinpoint a turning point in the match against YSRCP, I would say it came in September 2023. Pawan Kalyan visited Rajahmundry Central prison to meet Chandrababu Naidu who was in judicial custody. At a time when the TDP chief had no support from any political quarter, including the BJP, and the YSRCP government for baying for his blood, Pawan came across as a decent soul in the cutthroat world of Andhra politics. Not only did he express support, he also declared that the Jana Sena would fight the 2024 election with the TDP. This, when Naidu was still anathema to the BJP leadership and JSP was part of the NDA. Pawan showed spine and spunk, an important virtue that separates the winner from the losers. Over the next few months, Pawan Kalyan used his persuasive powers to good effect. He managed to convince Modi and Amit Shah that the wind was blowing against Jagan and if the anti-YSRCP vote was not split, it could ensure his defeat. So adamant was Pawan on forging a united front that it reminded one of his punch dialogue from ‘Cameraman Gangato Rambabu’ where his character said, “ Naaku tikka leste, cheema aina okkate, CM aina okkate (If I get triggered, whether it is an ant or a CM, they will meet the same fate).” Unlike politicians who bargain hard for every seat and hanker after the perks of political power, Pawan showed he is not cut of the same cloth. Not only did he bring down his original plan to contest 60 to 70 assembly seats to just 24 to be part of the alliance with the TDP, but also further reduced it to 21 to give away three extra seats to the BJP. His cadre was understandably upset as it saw it as an attempt to reduce his importance but he assured them saying winning the war was more important than winning smaller battles over seat sharing. It has not been easy for Pawan. He had been reportedly advised to wait instead of allowing himself to be used by Naidu. The argument was that if Jagan returned to power in 2024, the TDP wouldn't survive another defeat and then Pawan with age on his side, could move centrestage as the principal adversary to the YSRCP. But Pawan was in no mood to wait for 2029 and decided to make 2024 his own. While Naidu reached out to the more elderly crowd who had seen his work first hand in Hyderabad and united Andhra Pradesh, Pawan along with Nara Lokesh wooed the youth vote. While the BJP had no significant vote share to boast of in Andhra Pradesh, Modi brought in the promise of liberal central assistance for an NDA government in Amaravati. In the process, the NDA got all bases covered, leaving Jagan with little except his core constituency vote. Where does Pawan go from here? As a crowdpuller and his ability to whip up a frenzy, he remains unmatched in the terrain of Andhra politics. There is no clarity over whether he would become the deputy chief minister. He should, given his contribution and the stature he has acquired. It would also convince the Kapu community and the youth who voted for the alliance believing his word, that he won't be shortchanged. Within the family, he has stolen a march over Chiranjeevi, as far as their political graph goes. In 2008, Chiranjeevi launched Praja Rajyam and hoped to become chief minister, a la NTR. That was not to be and the mild-mannered Chiranjeevi, who clearly did not have the thick skin needed in the ugly politics that is practised in Andhra Pradesh, logged out and moved back to the world of the silver screen. Pawan withstood the personal jibes by Jagan and his partymen about his three marriages and focused on the job at hand. Pawan is one of the most saleable stars in Telugu cinema with a craze that is only matched by a Rajinikanth or a Vijay in the south Indian movie ecosystem. He is likely to dabble in acting every now and then to keep his kitchen fire and his party funds going. But in the short term, he is likely to remember the dialogue that was said to his character in ‘Vakeel Saab’ (remake of Amitabh Bachchan's ‘Pink’) – “ Ippudu Janalaki Nuvvu Kavali (Right now, the people need you).”"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A decade is a long time in politics and nothing exemplifies this better than the fate of the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) in Telangana. The party that led the struggle for statehood and was rewarded with two successive terms in office in the last decade, now finds itself out in the cold. It lost power in the state in the November assembly elections and now has failed to win a single seat in the Lok Sabha election. The BRS ‘car’ has officially run out of fuel. In 14 of the 17 seats, the party stood third. What's worse, in eight of those seats, the BRS lost its deposit. What led to this rout, though not entirely unexpected? The most obvious reason is that the BRS despite the ‘national’ tag in its freshly minted name, had no national story to sell to the electorate. Just like the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, the BJD in Odisha and the YSRCP in Andhra Pradesh. Clearly, the electorate sees a role for regional parties in a national election only if they are aligned to one of the two political blocs. The other reason was that even when the BRS had won 9 seats in 2019, its presence in the Lok Sabha did little to get goodies for Telangana since KCR was on the warpath with Narendra Modi. This resulted in the BRS vote share crashing from the 37 percent it won in December to 16 percent. Compared to its 2019 performance, the fall was worse - from 41 percent to 16 percent. It also lost the bypoll in the Secunderabad Cantonment assembly seat that it had won in December. Three, the hardcore BRS voter is also essentially anti-Congress by nature. Particularly the one who took part in the agitation for Telangana. This voter finds common cause with the BJP than with the Congress which is why he is comfortable voting for Modi at the Centre and KCR in the state. Which is perhaps why even though many BRS legislators moved closer to Revanth Reddy after KCR lost power, they did not quite help transfer significant BRS votes to the Congress. But was the crumbling of the BRS in this election entirely organic or was it also orchestrated from within? Conspiracy theories have been in the air ever since Telangana plunged into election mode. Revanth Reddy had accused KCR of striking a behind-the-scenes deal with the BJP under which the BRS would go slow in six constituencies - Mahbubnagar, Chevella, Malkajgiri, Secunderabad, Bhongir and Zaheerabad - in order to gift a victory to the saffron party in return for facilitating his daughter K Kavitha's bail in the Delhi liquor case. Reddy's argument was that “mortgaging the BRS interests” was to curry favour with the BJP besides hurting the Congress. What would give this theory more credence is that Hyderabad MP-elect Asaduddin Owaisi, who was close to KCR during his years in power, made the same observation after the results were out. He said that in many Parliamentary constituencies, the BRS leaders and cadre were openly supporting the BJP and criticised the strategy if it was indeed a thought-out decision. Data suggests that both Reddy and Owaisi are not exactly off the mark. Of the eight constituencies where the BRS lost its deposit, barring Hyderabad and Zaheerabad, the other six were won by the BJP. If one were to extrapolate the 2023 assembly results to Lok Sabha, the BRS could have won 7 seats. But it came crashing to zero. Take Malkajgiri for instance, where they got 9.35 lakh votes in all the seven assembly seats put together in December. With reports that an influential BRS leader worked against the party candidate's cause, the BRS candidate polled 3 lakh votes while BJP's victorious Eatala Rajender polled 9.91 lakh votes. Ditto in Chevella, where the BRS assembly vote share of 7 lakh has come down to 1.78 lakh now. Even in Siddipet assembly constituency (part of Medak parliamentary constituency) which is represented by BRS strongman Harish Rao, the BRS vote share fell drastically while BJP's Raghunandan tally spiked. Surprising, since Harish Rao has always won by a massive margin in Siddipet. BRS Working president KT Rama Rao in 2019 said that the party has as many 50 lakh workers. But the party polled only 36 lakh votes this time. A clear indication that a significant number of its workers did not vote for the BRS this election, raising the question - was the shift a reflection of cadre disenchantment with the party or part of a strategy, as Owaisi and Reddy suggest? Where does the BRS go from here? To the drawing board, ought to be its first port of call. That is because the party has to invest in its cadre and not in leaders. The system followed by KCR in the party is that the MLA is treated like the king or queen of the constituency. During the BRS rule, the legislator thus ended up becoming the `KCR' of his constituency with all political, administrative and financial decisions taken by him. This arrogance and feudal attitude cost the BRS in the election. With a number of ex-MLAs and the current crop of MLAs turncoats by nature, the BRS would find its stables fairly empty in due course of time. KCR can look at this as an opportunity to reboot the party structure by making the BRS a cadre-driven party instead of vesting all powers in the MLA. He needs to draw lessons from his erstwhile organisation, the Telugu Desam which survived five years of relentless YSRCP onslaught and staged a glorious comeback because of the structure of the party, its cadre and the support of the Kamma community. With the X-factor of the Telangana movement sentiment largely diluted now, the BRS has to focus on cadre connect and raise people's issues. The criticism, however, has to be constructive and negative rebuttals on social media cannot compensate for politics on the ground. The next few months will not be easy. The BRS has to get off its high horse and revert to the party of old in the days of the agitation. It will be as much a test of KCR's tenacity as it will be of his ability to shrewdly manoeuvre his way without the tonic of power. (Views expressed in this opinion piece are those of the author)"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Does Chandrababu Naidu have reason to be miffed that the two Union ministers from the TDP did not get portfolios considered to be ‘heavyweight’? While Ram Mohan Naidu was given the Civil Aviation ministry, MoS P Chandrasekhar is now junior in the Rural Development and Communications ministries. Not that the other allies fared much better. While former Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy of the JDS is now the Union minister for Heavy Industries and Steel, former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi is now minister for Micro, Small and Medium enterprises. Chirag Paswan of the LJP will handle Food Processing Industries while Rajiv Ranjan Singh of JDU has been given Panchayati Raj and Animal Husbandry. In contrast, the former chief ministers from the BJP in the Cabinet have bagged big ticket portfolios . Rajnath Singh presides over Defence while Shivraj Singh Chouhan will handle Agriculture and Rural development. Former Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has hit a lottery, getting three mega ministries of Housing, Urban Affairs and Power. So with the Cabinet now getting a settled look, will the allies be happy with it being celebrated as Modi 3.0 and not NDA 3.0? What is the message the BJP wants to send across? It is a fact that the BJP, in the manner in which it has largely maintained the status quo in the new cabinet, has sent a message across the aisle about who is the boss and who would call the shots. The murmurs so far have come from its allies in Maharashtra and that has to do more with the internal churning that is taking place within the NCP and the Shiv Sena. The opposition INDIA bloc has gone to town, highlighting how the BJP has “given toys to alliance partners.” Admittedly, the Telugu Desam would have liked a more important infrastructure portfolio like transport, IT or urban development, just like Kumaraswamy would have liked to preside over Agriculture. Chandrababu Naidu, however, is not one to rock the boat over portfolio allocations. And he has reasons not to. After the debacle of 2019, this is Naidu's best chance to get back his mojo. He also would be aware that he committed a political blunder by walking out of the NDA in 2018 and worse, rubbing shoulders and contesting the elections in Telangana with his traditional political rival, the Congress. He would not want to repeat the mistake which is why right now, unless something goes dramatically wrong, he would remain steadfast with the BJP. While it is a fact that the Andhra Pradesh victory is entirely a Naidu and Pawan Kalyan effort, the Telugu Desam chief knows that the BJP at the Centre is critical to his plans to take his state forward. His focus, therefore, would be less on plum portfolios and more on getting generous financial assistance from New Delhi. The seasoned political mind he is, Naidu would be more than conscious that Modi in his third term is not Vajpayee 1999-2004 and cannot be pushed around so easily. The BJP's moves in the last 48 hours has made it clear that the government will be Modi 3.0 but will morph into NDA 3.0 in the Lok Sabha, where cooperation from the allies would be its lifeline. Three, Naidu has his succession plan clearly drawn out and, like any other regional party, he would not want any other leader in the TDP - be it in Amaravati or New Delhi - to overshadow Nara Lokesh. The 2024 verdict has brought many young politicians in the party to the fore and while Naidu would like them to be part of Team Lokesh, he would be wary of what the opium of power in the national capital can do to an ambitious mind. Four, Naidu, on the back of his victory, would no longer be worried about the minority vote moving away because of allying with the BJP. That is quite a shift because more than two decades ago, in the aftermath of the Gujarat riots, he had asked the then Prime Minister AB Vajpayee to rein in Modi, then the chief minister of Gujarat. Now with the BJP as his electoral partner, Naidu has won two elections - in 2014 and in 2024. Going forward, the Muslim reservation promised by the TDP in Andhra Pradesh could be a sticky issue, but both senior politicians won't rock the boat over it. Five, Naidu and Modi would be on the same page as far as reform-oriented agenda is concerned. Naidu has been a votary of more tech in governance and Modi would do well to make him one of the poster boys of all such initiatives. Though it is expected to be largely a Modi show, the Prime Minister would have to pay more than just lip service to the cause of federalism. With powerful allies critical to its continuance in office, the Modi regime can no longer browbeat states into accepting its decisions without a murmur. In his first term, Modi would conduct meetings with chief ministers of all states, calling it ‘Team India’. Those would have to be restarted, both for the sake of optics and mending fences after a bitter and acrimonious election campaign. The BJP's slogan of ‘ sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwaas ’ will need to apply as much to the NDA partnership as to the people of India, because a Big Brother know-it-all attitude can be hurtful to fragile political egos."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In his long innings as the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, both detractors and admirers of Shivraj Singh Chouhan were unanimous in predicting that he was a future agriculture minister. Of course, their motives were different. Rivals, including those in the Bharatiya Janata Party, would often spread rumours about his imminent departure from state politics because they hoped to see a better future for themselves in his absence. Supporters, on the other hand, read it as a promotion. Even neutral observers saw a natural progression in the purported move. This is all to say that when the agriculture and rural development portfolios were allocated to the 65-year-old late on Monday, it didn’t come as a surprise to anyone. In a state where agriculture is the mainstay of nearly 70 per cent of the population, Chouhan has always sported his pro-kisan image on his sleeves , taking steps that were later copied by others. The state consistently clocked a very high agriculture growth rate under him. The agriculture growth rate reached a peak of 20.4 per cent in 2013-14. Though it moderated after that, it remained higher than the national average. Ironically, while the state Congress leadership doubted the farm output figures, the United Progressive Alliance government headed by Manmohan Singh gave a slew of central awards to Madhya Pradesh for increasing foodgrain production. How Chouhan championed farmers From giving a bonus over and above the minimum support price (MSP) announced by the Centre, to short-term crop loans at low interest, to creating elaborate infrastructure for wheat procurement, Chouhan had many firsts to his credit. Madhya Pradesh also substantially increased budgetary allocation to agriculture. No doubt, Chouhan took his pro-farmer initiatives by keeping a firm eye on electoral considerations as well — farmers are the largest demography in the state. One of the most populist measures he took early on (more than 15 years ago) was announcing a bonus of Rs 100 on every quintal for wheat growers who sell their produce to the government. This was so successful with MP farmers that many stopped selling to private players and chose to queue up outside procurement centres. Their enthusiasm was driven by Chouhan’s public assertions that “no farmer will be turned away, and even the last grain will be procured by the government”. The bonus scheme had an unexpected fallout. Farmers from neighbouring states started spiriting their produce to MP, taking volumes even further. The movement of wheat across borders was illegal, and it took a while for the government to get its act together. The success of the MP scheme also forced other state governments to copy it. Populist measures like these did create a problem for the Centre. Besides being saddled with surplus stocks, it bled financially. The Narendra Modi government eventually discontinued the scheme. But by then, Madhya Pradesh, under Chouhan, had a robust procurement infrastructure. Food grain production went up as irrigation networks allowed farmers to go for more than one crop. During the Congress regime, MP’s procurement was so negligible that it fell way short of the stocks needed to fulfill the public distribution system obligation. Now, Madhya Pradesh is spoken in the same breath as Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh in overall production and procurement. When the UPA was in power, Chouhan did not shy away from taking to the streets on farm issues. It was uncommon for chief ministers to organise dharnas then. In 2013, he announced an indefinite fast demanding a special package for farmers. Madhya Pradesh started growing basmati rice on a big scale after Chouhan became the chief minister. Though the volumes increased, the state failed to secure a Geographical Indication tag for the aromatic paddy variety cultivated in many districts. Undeterred by the legal setback, the state has continued to push for GI recognition despite opposition from certain quarters. BJP and farmers However, Chouhan had his first brush with angry farmers in the state in 2017. When commodity prices fell, farmers took to the streets demanding government intervention. In one such protest in Mandsaur, farmers went unruly, forcing the police to open fire. The deaths of six farmers, including five who succumbed to bullets fired by the police, had the BJP government on the edge. After the farm unrest, Chouhan claimed that Rs 30,000 crore was disbursed to farmers in one year. Although he did not provide the full breakdown, Chouhan listed Mukhyamantri Krishak Samruddhi Yojana, disbursal of cash incentives over and above the MSP, drought relief, and crop insurance as categories under which the largesse was doled out. The farm stir that began in early 2017 and continued for months was one of the main reasons for the BJP government’s narrow defeat in late 2018. Though the BJP received marginally more votes, the Congress won five more Assembly seats. While the Congress fell short of securing a simple majority by seats in the 230-member House, it formed a government with the help of independents, the Samajwadi Party, and the Bahujan Samaj Party. Chouhan's reluctance to leave his state Despite the agricultural transformation in the state on his watch, Chouhan was reluctant to leave the state boundaries for most of his career. He reconciled himself to the transition to central politics when he was replaced despite an overwhelming victory in the Assembly elections last December. In his central role, Chouhan’s skills will be tested to replicate what he achieved in MP in other parts of the country. Another state politician, Narendra Singh Tomar, also held the agriculture portfolio in the Narendra Modi government for a long time. At one point, Tomar, who is now the Assembly Speaker, wanted to replace Chouhan as chief minister. Though Chouhan has a much bigger profile than Tomar, he will have to go the extra mile to succeed in Delhi. Unlike previously, when speculations over his central role coincided when things were not going well for him, Chouhan has taken over the new responsibility on a confident note. If the pecking order visible at the oath-taking ceremony of PM Modi was any indication, Chouhan is now ranked very highly. The BJP won all 29 seats in MP, including Vidisha where Chouhan’s victory margin surpassed 8.20 lakh, but the party’s performance in most other states was below par."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party emerged as a hero in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections after the SP-Congress combine reduced the Bharatiya Janata Party in Uttar Pradesh to just 33 seats. Akhilesh and Rahul Gandhi — the do ladkon ki jodi — defeated the mighty Narendra Modi-Yogi Adityanath “double engine”, and played a key role in bringing down the BJP’s tally at national level. In neighbouring Bihar, however, Tejashwi Yadav could not replicate this success despite his popularity among the youth and Nitish Kumar’s declining appeal amid constant flip-flops. While the INDIA bloc dented the National Democratic Alliance tally in Bihar, it was on expected lines, Nitish Kumar’s gharwapsi benefitting the BJP-led coalition. The SP learnt its lessons in the 2022 Vidhan Sabha elections — while the party’s vote share increased by 10.2 per cent, it largely improved at the cost of the Bahujan Samaj Party and others; the BJP’s vote share rose by 1.6 per cent. In 2024, the SP’s vote share increased by 16 per cent and ally Congress by three per cent, coming equally at the expense of the BSP (10 per cent) and the BJP (nine per cent). This, in comparison to 2022, made all the difference as SP managed to make a dent in BJP's vote share. The INDIA bloc in Bihar (the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Congress, the Left parties, and the Vikassheel Insaan Party) won nine seats while the NDA won 30. Exit polls predicted 33 seats for the NDA and just six seats for INDIA — closer to the actual results, unlike in UP. The NDA got 47 per cent of the votes, a dip of six per cent, and the INDIA bloc mustered 37 per cent. While the RJD gained a seven per cent vote share, gaining three per cent each from the JD(U) and the BJP vote shares, its magnitude just wasn’t as big as the SP’s in Uttar Pradesh. Why SP performed better 1. Captain Akhilesh took responsibility The SP contested 62 of the 80 seats in UP, about 80 per cent, while the RJD contested 23 of Bihar’s 40 seats, about 60 per cent. The RJD gave three seats from its quota to the VIP; the party won zero seats in both 2019 and 2024. Akhilesh was criticised for giving too many seats to the Congress and other allies, 17 in total. But this seems to have worked. Tejashwi Yadav’s determination to defeat Pappu Yadav also cost the INDIA bloc, not just Purnia but also damaged the coalition’s chances in neighbouring seats. 2. SP shed MY party image The SP shed its Yadav tag by giving tickets to only five candidates from the caste group (just eight per cent of total tickets). The RJD gave tickets to nine Yadav candidates out of 23, 39 per cent of its total candidates. Hence, it was not able to convey the party’s message of representing all castes and communities. Half of its tickets were accounted for by Muslim-Yadav candidates. Akhilesh managed to expand his social coalition beyond the MY to include the PDA (pichhda, Dalit, and alpasankhyak). 3. SP made dents in BSP’s Dalit vote and BJP’s OBC vote The SP (coalition) received 16 per cent while the RJD (coalition) received only 10 per cent of the upper caste support. The former received 34 per cent of the Kurmi/Koeri vote while the latter received only 19 per cent. Teajshwi wasn’t able to dent this Nitish Kumar vote bank. The SP (and allies) received 82 per cent of the Yadav support while the RJD (and allies) received only 73 per cent — despite a much higher ticket distribution as per CSDS Post Poll Data 2024. The former received 34 per cent of the non-Yadav OBC vote while the latter received only 14 per cent. Denting the EBC/MBC vote bank was imperative to defeat the BJP, which Tejashwi failed to do. Akhilesh and allies received 92 per cent of the Muslim vote while Tejashwi and allies received 87 per cent. Among Dalits, the former received 25 per cent and 56 per cent support from Jatavs and non-Jatavs, while the latter received 35 per cent Dusadh and 42 per cent of the other Scheduled Castes support. 4. SP consolidated core vote better The increase of 35-38 per cent support for the SP-led coalition amongst the MY vote bloc itself would have accounted for an 11 per cent increase in the vote share of the alliance. The RJD alliance did much better compared to 2019 amongst SC voters, however, failed to make a significant dent in Other OBC voters. While the SP directly gave tickets to EBC candidates, Tejashwi relied on the VIP for this, which failed to deliver. 5. SP dented weak link Mayawati, Tejashwi couldn’t tame weak link Nitish Akhilesh exploited the weakening base of BSP well. In a highly bipolar election, the SP managed to wean not only the non-Jatav votes but even the Jatav votes of the BSP, riding on its PDA plank and the narrative that the BJP would end reservation if voted to power. The Congress, as part of the alliance, gave confidence to Dalits to switch from the BSP to the SP. On the other hand, while Tejashwi gained popularity amongst the youth, he was not able to make a severe dent in the EBC, women, and Kurmi/Koeri vote banks of the JD(U). All in all, while the NDA in Bihar relied heavily on Modi (OBC) - Yogi (Thakur) Jodi, in Bihar it had a wider array of caste leaders in Nitish (Kurmi), Samrat Chaudhary (Koeri/Kushwaha), Jiten Ram Manjhi (Mahadalit), Chirag Paswan (Dusadh) to wade off threat posed by Tejashwi."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In 1989, J Jayalalithaa walked out of the Tamil Nadu assembly with disheveled hair, a torn saree and tears in her eyes. She had accused the DMK legislators of assaulting her and vowed not to return to the House till her political rivals who were in power under M Karunanidhi as chief minister were defeated. She kept her promise triumphantly in 1991 when she was voted to power. History has repeated itself in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. In November 2021, Chandrababu Naidu was humiliated by MLAs of the then ruling party, the YSRCP, inside the assembly. Naidu claimed they had made personal remarks about his wife Bhuvaneswari and broke down at a news conference. He compared the assembly to the ‘Kaurava Sabha’ and vowed not to attend it till 2024. Naidu has now returned triumphantly back to the treasury benches while most of those who insulted him on that day, have been dumped by the voters. The difference between 2024 and his earlier innings as chief minister however, is that Naidu has never received such a massive mandate where over 93 percent of the House is part of the ruling NDA combined. So much so that YS Jagan Mohan Reddy with just 11 legislators in his camp won't even get the status of the Leader of the Opposition as a political party should have at least 10 per cent of total strength of the House which in the case of Andhra Pradesh would be 18. While the overwhelming support is a certain feel good factor for any politician, it also puts on Naidu's 74-year-old shoulders an onerous responsibility. A lot has been promised both in terms of welfare agenda and development of the state. Having seen the nature of the 2019 and the 2024 verdicts — when the TDP and the YSRCP were rejected outright respectively — Naidu knows the Andhra voter is a demanding one. He expects nothing less than a blockbuster performance which is why Naidu 4.0 needs a different Naidu, not a re-run of the same script. ‘Chandrababu Naidu Returns' is a sequel but as a first step, Naidu has taken care to bring in freshness to the cast. He has included several young legislators in his Cabinet instead of repeating the faces that have been part of several TDP regimes in the past. While he would have to walk the extra mile to pacify seniors like Kanna Laxminarayana, G Butchaiah Choudhary, Konathala Ramakrishna, Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy, Ayyanna Patrudu who would have reason to feel miffed at the exclusion from the cabinet, as many 9 debutant ministers will bring in a freshness to governance in the state. Repeating the same faces would have given a sense of deja vu. The transition was expected as the 2024 verdict has empowered Naidu to shift gears within the party to keep it ready for the succession plan to kick in within the TDP. The seniors would have found it difficult taking orders from Lokesh in case the baton is passed on within this term itself. Two, Naidu has chosen to embrace Reconstruction instead of Revenge, Development instead of Demolition. An example is his decision to greenlight the distribution of kits to schoolchildren bearing Jagan's photograph as the academic year is set to begin from Thursday. Though the practice of embossing the chief minister's photograph that is practised by most governments in India is a feudal approach to governance, Naidu's decision will mean the Andhra Pradesh government won't spend more money changing the kits that includes school bag, uniform, shoes and other stationery. With this decision, Naidu wants to show that he is not inclined to follow in Jagan's footsteps whose first decision in 2019 was to order the demolition of the Praja Vedika, a convention hall built by the previous Naidu regime at a cost of Rs 8.9 crore, citing illegalities in construction. One of Naidu's major focus areas is certain to be completion of the Polavaram irrigation project and capital city Amaravati which had turned into a ghost town in the last five years. The challenge would be to transform Amaravati into a vibrant city and kickstart the Amaravati economy to signal to the world that Andhra means business. Expect the construction activity to go hand in hand with Naidu's aggressive marketing touch. The difference Naidu needs to bring in this time is to ensure that human indices define Andhra Pradesh, not just brick and mortar. But while selling Amaravati to the world, Naidu should not make the mistake he made in Hyderabad during his first two terms as chief minister between 1995 and 2004 or between 2014-19 in Amaravati. On both occasions, his focus was too centralised leading other districts to feel neglected. Now, he should specifically market each district differently to different kinds of investors so that while Amaravati remains the magnet, the natural resources of other districts make each one an attractive investment destination. Naidu has announced that Visakhapatnam will be the financial capital but the PSU City of Destiny with its salubrious weather is equally suited for development of Industries and IT. Likewise, Kakinada is suited for aquaculture, Anantapur for manufacturing and so on. On the political front, I expect a clear division of roles between Naidu and Lokesh . Naidu would like to cast himself as the elder statesman who would not engage in ugly verbal volleys with the opposition in Andhra Pradesh. That role, which will need a lot of raw aggression given how fiercely contested Andhra politics is, is likely to be handled by Lokesh and the young Turks in the TDP. Naidu should focus more on strategising, dealing with a set of task-oriented bureaucrats and the Centre to get as much as he can for the state. The optics of Modi and Naidu hugging each other is a sign of a happy bromance amidst hope that the double engine sarkar can impart bullet train-like impetus to decision making and project clearance. In the first two governments in Andhra Pradesh, both the TDP and the YSRCP created outfits that ended up becoming a law unto themselves. Naidu had created Janmabhoomi committees in villages to provide representation to TDP cadres on the ground but they emerged as a parallel structure to the elected panchayat bodies, leading to frequent clashes. They were blamed for the TDP's defeat in 2019. Ditto the YSRCP which created an army of 2.5 lakh volunteers to help with disbursal of government sops at the doorstep. Through the Jagan reign, these volunteers became an extension of the ruling party who would not take kindly to any anti-Jagan talk by anyone. Naidu would do well not to create any such outfits that are not mandated by law. On Tuesday, when the NDA Legislature Party met to elect Naidu as its leader, the TDP chief found that a more fancy chair had been reserved for him. He asked his security men to remove it and instead bring a chair of the kind on which Pawan Kalyan and Andhra Pradesh BJP chief D Purandareswari were seated. With the Kissa Kursi ka settled, Team Naidu now needs to bring its A-game to the governance table."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Six out of the top ten performers in last year's civil service examinations were women. This year, the total number of successful female candidates is 352 out of 1016 aspirants. Among them, 50 candidates are from the minority community. The total number of recruits selected for foreign service is 37, along with 180 for administrative service, 200 for police service, and 147 for forest service. In this era, where not only the women's rights movements, but also the Union of India plans to introduce the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam (Women's Reservation Bill) to fulfill the long-overdue demand for one-third representation for women in the lawmakers club, here, women have secured, on merit, slightly more than what has been advocated for so long. In the second decade of the 21st century, participation of women in public services increased from 24 per cent in 2018 to 34 percent in 2024. Today, women are striving hard to script unique and remarkable tales of struggle and strength. At 22, Donuru Ananya Reddy secured the third position in the all-India rankings at her very first attempt. She hails from the family of paddy farmers in the village of Ponnekal, located 23 kilometres away from the district headquarters of Mahbubnagar in Telangana. Ananya graduated from Delhi University’s Miranda House with a degree in geography and chose anthropology as her optional subject. Another achiever from Gurugram, Ruhani, 28, secured the fifth rank on her sixth and final attempt. She graduated in economics from St Stephen’s College, Delhi University. In a previous attempt, she had secured a position and was undergoing training in Hyderabad when the results were announced on April 16. The only candidate from the minority community in the top ten is also a woman. Nausheen, born in Kushinagar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, secured the ninth rank in her fourth attempt. After her third unsuccessful attempt, she slipped into depression, but her subsequent results indicated a swift recovery. Nausheen is also a graduate of Delhi University. Additionally, her father, Abdul Qayyum, serves as the assistant director of All India Radio (AIR). Punjab secured one seat among the top 100 candidates. Gurleen Kaur, 31, secured the 30th rank in her fourth attempt. She is the daughter of Dr Balwinder Kaur Mann, a retired district health officer, and is also a qualified doctor herself. In 2021, she achieved the ninth rank in the provincial public services exam to join the state government. Gurleen's story represents a unique struggle, as she prepared for the exam without taking a sabbatical from her full-time administrative job. In 1972, national tennis player Kiran Bedi cleared the civil service examinations and became the first woman IPS officer. After more than half a century, another national and international player has joined the Indian Police Service. Kuhoo Garg, 25, secured the 178th position in her second attempt, following her remarkable achievements of winning over 50 national and 19 international medals in badminton. She graduated in economics from the Shri Ram College of Commerce, Delhi University. Kuhoo has the distinction of representing India for six years, and she now follows in the footsteps of her father, Ashok Kumar, a 1989 batch IPS officer and sportsman. After retiring from the post of Director General of Police in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, Ashok Kumar joined Haryana Sports University as its Vice Chancellor. At the pinnacle of her career in the playground, Kuhoo achieved a top world ranking of 34 in mixed doubles, followed by securing the number one spot in India. In the same year, she reached the quarter-finals of the World Championship. However, Kuhoo sustained a serious knee injury during a trial of the Uber Asia Cup, leading her to reconsider her career path. She underwent surgery for an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) tear and was unable to participate in any of the matches for a year. Consequently, she decided to prepare for the UPSC exams. \"I am going to fight at any cost\" became her mantra for success. Reflecting on her journey, Kuhoo recalled, \"I competed in the World Championships and the Asian Championships. The Olympics were the next step.\" Throughout her recovery process, she rescheduled her practice sessions to accommodate 8 to 10 hours of daily preparation for this new goal. Online resources, along with support from her father and her mother, Professor Alaknanda Ashok proved invaluable in her journey. Sports stars have often been sought after as celebrities by certain state departments and lawmakers' clubs. While the bureaucracy has successfully managed them in various capacities, they have rarely been allowed entry into the prestigious civil services, and few celebrated sportspersons have attempted and cleared the examination. However, Kiran Bedi and Kuhoo Garg stand out as exemplary figures, embodying the spirit of sportsmanship in uniform. Both of them began their practice at the age of 9, a shared characteristic between the two. Bedi won the national junior championship in 1966 and 1972, and after joining the IPS, she secured the seniors’ title in 1974. Kuhoo's achievements in sports are equally impressive, reflecting her dedication and sincerity towards the game. However, this narrative of women's struggle and strength remains incomplete without the mention of Sarika AK. The 23-year-old from Kerala is the daughter of Sasi, a driver in Qatar, and Ragi, a homemaker. Despite suffering from Cerebral Palsy, a disorder affecting muscle movement with symptoms ranging from mild to severe, Sarika has persevered. Her right hand is completely disabled, and only three fingers of her left-hand function. Despite these challenges, she secured the 922nd rank in her second attempt, drawing inspiration from Jessica Cox, the licensed pilot without arms. Indeed, public service continues to be one of the top aspirations for the younger generations in India. The bureaucracy and executive machinery rely heavily on it for effective governance. The struggles of courageous women like Kiran Bedi, Kuhoo Garg, and Sarika AK have brought forth a plethora of heartwarming stories of strength and resilience. They serve as new sources of inspiration for young India, encouraging them to pursue their dreams with determination and perseverance."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The past half a decade has been tumultuous. A continuing global recovery from the pandemic. Geopolitical flashpoints such as wars in Ukraine and Gaza. The US left Afghanistan in 2021 as part of an “exit” deal with the Taliban and maintaining minimum forces in both Iraq and Syria to counter the Islamic State (ISIS or Daesh in Arabic), signalling the end of the “war on terror”. This, however, does not mean that the threat of terrorism is over, or even diminished. At best, attention has moved to more pressing matters of the day, until the next attack. The recent arrest of four Sri Lankan citizens in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, piques interest. The Sri Lanka story The Gujarat Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) arrested the four people for allegedly having links to ISIS — more specifically the Afghanistan-Pakistan-based Islamic State Khorasan (ISKP) — and travelling to India with intent to conduct terror attacks. The Sri Lankans were reportedly moving on the orders of the pseudonymous Pakistani handler “Abu Pakistani”. Sri Lanka’s security agencies also arrested another alleged local handler, Pushparaja Osman. The accused also reportedly explained that they were previously associated with the Sri Lankan extremist outfit National Thowheeth Jamath (NJT). ISIS is not a group commonly equated for its presence in Sri Lanka, where over 70 per cent of the population is Buddhist. Muslims constitute less than 10 per cent and are a minority. But in 2019, several explosions ripped across the island nation’s capital, targeting churches and upscale hotels. Over 260 people were killed, and ISIS took responsibility, without providing any evidence of directly supporting the act of terror. Immediately after the Easter attack, links between the terrorists and certain entities in India’s southern states were highlighted. The leader of the Easter bombings ring, Zahran Hashim, was reportedly in touch with individuals in India via social media. Indian security agencies have since dismantled several self-styled pro-ISIS groupings across the country, but some much more specifically in the south. Over the years, India has also taken back individuals from Gulf states who have been involved in extremist activities, including in favour of ISIS. A level of translucency remains on how these individual cases were approached legally. Much like other countries, many accused of supporting banned outfits like ISIS eventually were released from custody due to lack of evidence presented to the courts, or investigations hitting a dead end. ISIS crossovers The four arrested individuals from Ahmedabad and their history with NJT is not an anomaly. The decay of ISIS Central since 2018-19, which was at its territorial and ideological peak in Iraq and Syria under Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi, has not meant the group’s influence has debilitated. In fact, it has only been subsumed more aggressively by regional affiliates of the Islamic State, from those in Africa to the likes of Islamic State Khorasan operating in the political and theological crevasses between Afghanistan and Pakistan. While the regional wilayats look to exert more influence and power alike, ISIS central itself is also consistently looking to rebuild, forcing the US, for example, to maintain a minimal but visible military deployment in both Iraq and Syria as part of its anti-ISIS mission. But ISIS as an ideology and group has also attracted many crossovers: ideologically radicalised, predominantly youth, leaving behind more regional and hyper-local entities to join ISIS’s brand of pan-globalist jihad is a trend that continues even today. For example, ISKP’s cadre base is ethnically diverse, ranging from Tajiks and Uzbeks to Uyghurs and Pashtuns. A few Indians have also been known to have joined the group. Most recently, an Indian-origin man from Kerala was arrested in the southern Afghan province of Kandahar, the Taliban’s ideological home. Sanaul Islam made his way across the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border, reportedly in an attempt to join ISIS. Localised terror groups have much clearer political aims than say a pan-Islamist group such as ISIS. Unless these narrow political aims are shared in the same manner and depth, some radicalised, particularly those in their youth, tend to look for bigger and broader aims to satiate their ideological extremism. In this case, ISIS continues to represent, for some attracted to the group a globalist war for the protection of Islam. This is represented through ISIS propaganda, where it criticises not only states like Israel, the US, and India for what they perceive as anti-Muslim agendas, but also aims Arab monarchies, and even the Taliban in Afghanistan, for working closely with states and entities perceived as being anti-Islam. For example, in its latest propaganda video release, ISKP has criticised the Taliban for taking developmental help from the United Nations and associated entities. The Sri Lanka example highlights the disparity between the terror attacks that get appropriate international attention and those that don’t. A noted scholar of terrorism, Professor Rohan Gunaratna, recently wrote that Sri Lanka and its religious leaders and elites need to come to terms that there is an underbelly of radicalisation in the country. Need for counter-terrorism cooperation in South Asia However, beyond such issues that come under the ambit of a sovereign nation’s judiciary and law enforcement, there has been no institutionalisation of counter-terrorism cooperation in South Asia. In an ideal world, an organisation such as SAARC would host a robust counter-terror cooperative to discuss these issues. And an even further idealistic world, through such a regional entity, an India-backed and funded version of an intelligence-sharing apparatus such as the Five Eyes (made up of the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand) would be mobilised, excluding Pakistan and even Afghanistan for now. Pakistan remains a huge hindrance to any such institutional undertaking in the region. A prime sponsor of cross-border terrorism as state policy, its designs have been detrimental to regional security for years. The fact that Pakistan today faces security challenges with a group such as the Taliban on the contested Durand Line showcases its myopia on what it has perceived as a useful tool against India’s rise for decades. Pakistan’s inability to clean up its own house and reorient its national identity away from an obsessive view of India’s downfall to its economic well-being has had regional-wide consequences. That today Islamabad, with a straight face, can raise the alarm of it facing a terrorism threat is worthy of the Oxford Dictionary re-defining the term “irony” in its pages. Finally, the Sri Lanka case, and the arrests in Ahmedabad, highlight that the pro-ISIS threat has a strong probability of often slipping under the radar. India should look to build a regional mechanism, focusing on most border states, to debate countering terrorism under one roof. Even as the world remains distracted between pandemics and warfare, from Ukraine to Gaza, or big power competition between the US, China, and Russia, the threat of terrorism has only abated, or depleted, till the next large-scale attack occurs.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story An exclusive survey conducted by CVoter for Yale University’s Program on Climate Change Communication finds that a majority of Indians say that global warming is real and caused mostly by human activities, is harmful to themselves and other people in India, and strongly support the clean energy transition. Indeed, 78 per cent of Indians believe global warming is happening and 85 per cent say they have personally experienced its effects. Perhaps surprisingly, a large majority of Indians (84 per cent) favour banning the construction of new coal power plants, closing existing ones, and replacing them with solar and wind energy. Not only do most Indians support various environmental protection policies, but they are also willing to adopt environmentally-friendly behaviours. About 3 in 4 Indians are willing to pay up to 10 per cent or more for energy-efficient appliances and electric vehicles to reduce costs and global warming. These findings suggest that some politicians’ and experts’ fears about a public backlash against ambitious action on global warming may be unwarranted. Indeed, the percentage of people in India who say the government of India should be doing “much more” to address global warming is 15 percentage points higher than in our previous survey in 2021-22. Global warming is real and increasingly personal CVoter conducted this milestone survey in collaboration with a team of global experts led by Yale University. It was conducted between September and November 2023, interviewing 2,178 adult Indians above the age of 18 contacted on their mobile phones using random sampling techniques. A report describing the results of the survey was recently released by Yale University. The results should not come as a surprise. The 2024 heatwaves amidst the elections were made 45 times more likely and 0.85ºC hotter, according to scientists at World Weather Attribution. In 2023, large parts of India suffered an unprecedented heatwave that resulted in at least 264 deaths. Scientists say climate change made this devastating heat wave 30 times more likely. Heatwaves like these over the Indian subcontinent will become even more common and hotter in the future due to global warming. Excessive heat in the oceans and the atmosphere has been supercharging cyclones, such as Cyclone Michaung, which recently flooded Chennai. According to the World Meteorological Organisation, Asia is the world’s most disaster-hit region regarding weather, climate, and water-related hazards in 2023. Large majorities of people in India are worried about various hazards harming their local areas, including severe heat waves (85 per cent), droughts and water shortages (85 per cent), severe air pollution (85 per cent), famines and food shortages (83 per cent), severe cyclones (76 per cent), and severe floods (71 per cent). Three in four Indians (75 per cent) say it would take their household several months or more to recover from a severe flood and a higher proportion (85 per cent) say it would take them months or more to recover from a severe drought. The percentage of people who say it would take their household several months or more to recover from a severe flood is 12 percentage points higher than in the 2022 survey. About one in three people in India (34 per cent) say they have either already moved (14 per cent) or considered moving (20 per cent) because of weather-related disasters. Importantly, just over half (54 per cent) of respondents say they know little or nothing about global warming. Only 33 per cent of respondents say they hear about global warming on media platforms even once a week. But when a simple definition was provided describing climate change and how it affects weather patterns, 78 per cent of respondents immediately said that climate change is happening. In the latest CVoter/Yale survey, 52 per cent of the respondents say human activities are primarily responsible for global warming, while 38 per cent say it is a product mainly of natural causes. Most importantly, global warming is a reality that most Indians now face in their communities. More than four in five Indians say they have personally experienced global warming and its consequences. This is 11 percentage points higher than the previous survey conducted in 2022 and 43 percentage points higher than our first survey in 2011. Indians are increasingly worried about global warming The CVoter/Yale survey also finds that a large majority of Indians are convinced global warming poses significant risks. A large majority of Indians (91 per cent) say they are worried about global warming. The percentage of Indians who say they are “very worried” is 9 percentage points higher than in 2022 and 39 per cent higher than in the 2011 survey. Three out of every four Indians say that global warming not only harms the lives and livelihoods of their families and communities but also imperils future generations. In fact, more than 50 per cent of Indians are convinced global warming is already harming people in India. India experienced an extreme weather disaster almost every day in the first nine months of 2023, which resulted in about 3,000 deaths, affected 1.84 million hectares of crop area, destroyed over 80,563 houses and killed close to 92,519 livestock, according to a report by the Centre for Science and Environment. About 7 in 10 Indians think global warming will cause more severe heatwaves, severe cyclones, extinction of plant and animal species, droughts and water shortages, famines and food shortages, and severe floods if nothing is done to address it. Most Indians think global warming affects weather in their local area (71 per cent) and monsoons (76 per cent). Indians support the 2070 Net Zero goal India already faces a host of developmental challenges, and some may believe that investing resources to address global warming may result in a public backlash. India needs to invest 1.5 times or more than advanced economies as a share of GDP today to support economic development and build low-carbon infrastructure. Without international support, financing this additional investment would likely result in a 2 per cent decline in total household consumption. Indeed, the transition to clean energy may result in the loss of about 5 million well-paying jobs, according to the Asia Society, often in regions that are hungry for development. But Indians also express very strong support for concrete steps to combat global warming and accelerate the clean energy transition. More than 90 per cent of Indians support a national program to train people for new jobs in the renewable energy industry, such as wind and solar, which is 11 percentage points higher than the 2022 survey. Similarly, over 90 per cent of Indians support national programs to fund women’s groups and Indigenous communities to protect the environment, and to teach all Indians about global warming. At the 26th United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 26) in November 2021, the Indian government announced its intention to reach Net Zero carbon pollution by 2070. A large majority of people in India (86 per cent) say they either “strongly favour” (69 per cent) or “somewhat favour” (17 per cent) this commitment. More than 8 in 10 Indians think that if India were to transition from using coal to using wind and solar energy for electricity generation, it will reduce air pollution. However, Indians are also cognisant of the challenges of a just transition: more than 50 per cent also fear that the energy transition could increase unemployment (61%), cause electricity outages (58%), and increase electricity prices (57 per cent). Even though about 75 per cent of electricity in India comes from burning coal, more than 8 in 10 Indians favour banning the construction of new coal power plants, closing existing ones, and replacing them with solar and wind energy. By comparison, only about one in ten oppose it. Indians are willing to change their behaviour and join a citizens’ campaign for climate action At COP26, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for a global mass movement for behaviour change, Lifestyle for the Environment (LiFE), and asked people to take three pledges. A large majority in India are either engaged or willing to make personal lifestyle changes, persuade family and friends, and publicly demonstrate environmentally friendly actions to influence others. A large majority of people in India (87 per cent) say they are either “already participating in” (6 per cent) or are “definitely” (60 per cent) or “probably” (21 per cent) willing to join a citizens’ campaign to convince elected officials to take action to reduce global warming. Similarly, about nine in ten Indians (89 per cent) say they are already engaged or willing to engage in collective preparedness actions, such as joining a community emergency response team to prepare for and respond to extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, or cyclones in their local area. Similarly, 87 per cent of Indians are willing to ask local government officials to publicly explain their emergency response plans to help their local community prepare and respond to extreme weather events. Combating global warming is good economics A large majority (74 per cent) of Indians say that taking steps to combat global warming will improve India’s economic growth or have no negative effect on the economy and jobs. This includes 51 per cent of the respondents who said the steps will lead to new job creation. Only 21 per cent of Indians think that taking concrete steps to combat global warming will harm growth and cost jobs. When asked about the best pathway to a healthy, safe, and prosperous future for India, about two in three (67 per cent) Indians say it would be best to leave most of the country’s coal in the ground. By comparison, only one in four people in India (24 per cent) say it would be best to rely on India’s abundant coal for decades to come. What does this mean? First, Indians recognise that global warming is a reality and a serious threat to themselves and India as a whole. Second, most Indians support strong action to reduce global warming, even if the costs of goods and services go up. Third and most importantly, a majority of Indians prefer a future powered by clean energy.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The mood at the meeting of the YSRCP MPs and senior leaders in Tadepalli near Vijayawada on Friday was understandably sombre. YS Jaganmohan Reddy was visibly emotional as he expressed his inability to understand why the party had lost so badly after what he called “doing admirable work” in the last five years. It is obvious that the NDA political truck that rammed into the YSRCP on June 4 and brought down the entire edifice with its electoral explosives has shaken Jagan and Co. So is it the end of the road for the YSRCP? Far from it. If the Telugu Desam which was reduced to 23 MLAs and 3 MPs in the 2019 elections, could bounce back with such astounding numbers, so can any party, including the YSRCP. What is happening in Andhra Pradesh is that the people are dishing out Tamil Nadu-like one-sided Tsunami verdicts. Despite that, in Tamil Nadu, both the Dravidian parties - the DMK and the AIADMK - have taken turns to rule the state with the government changing every five years, 2016 being the sole exception in recent years. But for that to happen, Jagan will have to embrace a transformation of his personality, his party structure and the kind of company he keeps. As senior Congress leader Arun Kumar, who was a close associate of Jagan's father, the late YS Rajasekhara Reddy, pointed out the YSRCP is just Jagan at one end and the voters at the other. What is missing is a stable political structure. A set of bureaucrats and advisors with no skin in the game ran the YSRCP show and controlled access to the chief minister. In the bargain, Jagan had become inaccessible adding to his image of being aloof and stubborn that was crafted by the TDP. The images of Jagan embracing people during the business end of the election campaign, came too late to repair the damage. Not only that. It seemed as if an autocratic attitude was the mantra the YSRCP swore by. The village volunteer system, which the Naidu government is persisting with, enabled the YSRCP local-level leadership to keep a close eye on anyone suspected to be on the TDP's side. It is a miracle that despite having its eyes and ears on the ground, the YSRCP did not do anything to arrest the damage and succumbed to such a humiliating defeat when, with 11 legislators, Jagan would not even get the Leader of the Opposition status. The party needed to win at least 18 seats (10 percent of the total strength of the House) in order to get that position. Many YSRCP MLAs and their kith and kin were a law unto themselves in the constituencies, bulldozing industrialists to award all contracts for security, transport and catering to them. This enabled the YSRCP strongmen to disrupt the work of an industrial plant whenever they felt like arm twisting the entrepreneurs to shell out more money. This is why when Naidu cautioned the people against the Land Titling Act and pointed to Jagan's photograph embossed on the land document passbook, people were convinced that their lands were not safe under a YSRCP regime. This was the gamechanger that completely turned the election against the YSRCP even though the Act was drafted by Niti Aayog, a Government of India agency. So what does Jagan need to do in order to be relevant again? For one , he has four Lok Sabha MPs who could become politically significant in case of a change in equations at the Centre. More importantly, the YSRCP has 11 Rajya Sabha MPs and the NDA would need their support to pass crucial bills. On the other hand, the BJP's partners in Andhra Pradesh - the TDP and the Jana Sena - have no presence in the Upper House. This gives Jagan some bargaining power with the BJP leadership if the Naidu regime decides to target him for decisions taken during his years in power. Jagan's bad luck was that even with 22 MPs, he could not garner much for Andhra Pradesh as the BJP had a comfortable majority in New Delhi while with 16 MPs, Naidu would be able to get his way. Two , Jagan will need to recast the party which is now basically a one-mascot entity. He needs to mentor a fresh crop of grassroots level community leaders in every constituency who work on social issues and are divorced from business interests. Three , he needs to spend the next five years working out a model of governance where welfare and development are married to each other. Despite having been associated with business before he entered politics, Jagan's aversion to woo investment aggressively meant Andhra Pradesh was no longer a destination much of the industry was looking at. A chief minister needs to be a salesperson for his state as well, and it is this image, reputation and track record that has earned Naidu a fourth term in Andhra Pradesh. Four , what worked for Jagan pre-2019 was his people connect especially during his ‘padayatra’. The last five years saw him forever cocooned in his office space, with time only for meetings with ministers and bureaucrats. Now that he no longer wears the hat of the CM, Jagan needs to bide his time during this initial honeymoon period of the new government and then look for issues on which to connect back with the people. The silver lining is that the party won 39 percent of the vote which is not insignificant by any stretch of imagination. Five , the party needs to invest in spokespersons who are subject experts and who do not reduce a debate to name-calling. His social media arm too needs to realise that memes alone do not make a campaign. Politics in Andhra Pradesh is fierce and the YSRCP will have to make an attempt to look and sound different if it is serious about getting another chance in 2029. Six , make up with his sister YS Sharmila Reddy because a leader under fire from his own sibling does not make for a pretty picture. Their mother Vijayamma ought to take the lead to play peacemaker. But the immediate future won't be easy. The CBI court is to re-start hearing cases relating to disproportionate assets against Jagan from June 19. His cousin and Kadapa MP YS Avinash Reddy is an accused in the murder case of Jagan's uncle YS Vivekananda Reddy and Jagan's decision to back Avinash despite opposition from Sharmila was a talking point in this election. Further investigation in that case too would muddy the waters for the YSRCP. The attacks on YSRCP cadre, allegedly by the TDP and Jana Sena activists, since the day the results were announced, have been a matter of concern too. During his election campaign, Jagan would urge the people to keep the TDP bicycle (election symbol) outside the house and dump the Jana Sena glass (election symbol) in the sink and switch on the ceiling fan (YSRCP election symbol). Now that the people decided to switch off power to the fan instead, Jagan will have to find ways to beat the heat. (Views expressed in this opinion piece are those of the author)"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The AIADMK ego is bruised after failing to open its account in the Lok Sabha elections in Tamil Nadu. Worse, the NDA secured the 2nd position in 12 constituencies, pushing the AIADMK to 3rd spot. Even more humiliating was the verdict from Kanyakumari and Puducherry, where even Seeman's NTK overtook the AIADMK, pushing it to fourth place. The immediate fallout of the 0/40 score is that the AIADMK has decided not to contest the byelection to the Vikravandi assembly constituency on July 10. The seat had become vacant after DMK legislator N Pugazhendhi's demise due to illness in April. The official reason cited by AIADMK supremo Edappadi Palaniswami is that the election won't take place in a “free and fair manner”. He alleged that the ruling party would misuse state machinery and “commit atrocities and irregularities, using money and muscle power”. He said the party had based its decision on the experience in the Erode (East) assembly bypoll in 2023 where he claimed voters had been bribed. To make it seem that he was taking a leaf from his late leader J Jayalalithaa's book, EPS pointed out how she had boycotted bypolls in constituencies like Cumbam and Bargoor in 2009 when the DMK was similarly in power. The point EPS was trying to make is that just like Jayalalithaa came to power in 2011 despite boycotting bypolls, the AIADMK under his leadership could do the same in 2026. The real reason, however, is the AIADMK's inability to find a candidate strong enough to take on the DMK's might. More importantly, a defeat would further raise questions about the ability of EPS to lead the AIADMK back to Fort St George two years from now. But would repeating the Jayalalithaa strategy help the AIADMK now? The big difference between Jayalalithaa of 2009 and EPS of 2024 is that there was no NDA breathing down the AIADMK's neck then. In a strategic move, the BJP has decided to let the PMK contest from Vikravandi as the NDA candidate. This is to send across the message that the NDA stays intact despite not winning any seat in the Lok Sabha polls. Vikravandi is part of the Villupuram Lok Sabha constituency where the PMK's performance was nothing to write home about as it ended a poor third. The AIADMK actually ran the victorious INDIA alliance candidate D Ravikumar of the VCK close, losing by 70,000 votes. That's why the AIADMK decision to leave the opposition space entirely to the NDA is baffling. To say the alarm bells have not rung in the AIADMK would be an understatement. In the Lok Sabha polls, the party ceded space to the NDA in constituencies in Chennai and south Tamil Nadu besides politically important pockets like Coimbatore, Vellore and Dharmapuri. The AIADMK's sole seat in 2019 had come in Theni in southern Tamil Nadu but with the exit of leaders like O Panneerselvam and TTV Dhinakaran, the Thevar community vote seems to have deserted the AIADMK. Its vote share has shrunk from 44 per cent under Jayalalithaa in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls to 20.47 per cent now. The counter-argument is that AIADMK has put up a better show than 2019 when it garnered 19.39 per cent vote in an alliance with the BJP. While pro-EPS voices support his decision not to waste money and energy in a byelection, the risk with staying out of the Vikravandi contest is that the anti-DMK vote - and that would include many original AIADMK votes - could consolidate behind the PMK. This would end up giving a fillip and bragging rights to the NDA even if the PMK candidate ends up a decent second. This would further spur the NDA to project itself as the real and more aggressive opposition to the DMK-led INDIA bloc in Tamil Nadu and try to make the AIADMK irrelevant. The INDIA bloc however, smells a rat. It suspects the AIADMK has been nudged to keep out to facilitate the chances of the NDA candidate and this could be a precursor to the two joining hands ahead of 2026. EPS however, has ruled out any such possibility despite reports of difference of opinion within the AIADMK leadership about the party's relationship with the BJP. EPS knows that joining hands with the BJP would reduce his own bargaining power and open the doors for the re-entry of OPS into the AIADMK, which he is completely opposed to. Moreover, having snapped ties with the BJP following Annamalai's remarks against CN Annadurai and Jayalalithaa and having spurned subsequent overtures to reconsider his decision, EPS won't be able to explain a U-turn to his cadre. Three, the view also is that the DMK alliance's electoral success has come on the back of a strident anti-BJP position and Team EPS feels it is appreciated by the people of Tamil Nadu. EPS is pinning his hopes on a different narrative that will decide voter behaviour in the 2026 assembly elections. National issues, he believes, won't be centre stage and that would make the BJP irrelevant. His real challenge would be to identify 234 candidates with the potential to win in 2026. Just pinning his hopes on anti-incumbency against the DMK won't suffice. (Views expressed in this opinion piece are those of the author)"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story On June 9, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with the help of its allies, once again formed the government under Narendra Modi’s leadership. In its aftermath, there has been an attempt to manufacture a narrative about the “differences” between the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the BJP. The Sangh has never been active in politics but has always worked for the welfare of the people, without any attachment, hatred, or discord. Sarsanghchalak (the head of the RSS) Dr Mohan Bhagwat clearly stated in a recent speech in Nagpur that there is a need to improve India’s political culture and build a national consensus on the challenges faced by the government. In fact, he appreciated the work done by the Modi government in the last 10 years, while underlining the challenges that remain and the need for political parties to come together for the development of the country. Since its inception, the Sangh has not been active at an organisational level to vote in favour or against any political party. The volunteers of the Sangh make people aware of the emerging challenges facing the country (i.e., Lokmat Parishkar) and motivate them to vote in the country's interest. Undoubtedly, many Swayamsevaks, based on Sangh's inspiration and values, have worked in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh in the past and currently in the BJP. Both the party and the country have benefited from their extraordinary and unrivalled contribution from time to time. The Sangh does not seek credit for this contribution at any level. To fully comprehend the organic relationship between the BJP and the RSS, it is essential to understand the foundational principles of the Sangh. The RSS, founded in 1925, promotes Sanatan culture, national unity, and self-reliance. It works as a socio-cultural organisation — and the BJP, its ideological mentee, as a political entity. This separation is rooted in the RSS's belief that it should remain above the fray of partisan politics and serve as a guiding force for the nation's cultural and social renaissance. The RSS has historically played a crucial role in steering the ideological moorings of like-minded entities. It aims to keep these organisations aligned with the wider goals of social upliftment. Its consistent stand is to emphasise social harmony and national unity and promote “Bharatiya” cultural values compatible with democracy, pluralism, and the well-being of all citizens. The Sangh’s role can be better understood as that of a moral and ideological compass. Like three dozen other RSS-inspired organisations, it provides guidance to the BJP whenever it is sought. This approach is consistent with the RSS’ position as a socio-cultural organisation dedicated to promoting the values of Hindu culture, national unity, and self-reliance. The Sangh’s stand, therefore, should not be viewed as an attempt to undermine or control the BJP's policies or decision-making processes. Instead, both organisations' shared ideological roots ensure they achieve the same goal within their spheres: inclusive development. There have been unnecessary and mischievous attempts to create a rift between the RSS and the BJP. One must understand that the organic relationship between the two has evolved since the Bharatiya Jana Sangh’s formation in 1951. It is a mature relationship and continues to grow. Unlike in the past, when the BJS and the BJP primarily occupied the Opposition space, the latter has now become the central point of reference in Indian politics. The BJP-led NDA has come to power for the third consecutive term at the Centre. The pre-poll alliance secured a comfortable majority, and it is no small feat in Indian politics that the BJP got as many as 240 seats even after two terms. Its vote share is intact. It has made spectacular gains in Odisha and southern parts of the country. The BJP ran a high-pitched campaign under the dynamic leadership of Narendra Modi. In the relative sense, as compared to the benchmark, the party may have performed less than expected, but in the absolute sense, the BJP has come out with a historical performance, something no party is likely to repeat over the next few decades. Common sense then dictates that there is no reason for any rumblings between the RSS and BJP. The Sarsanghchalak rightly pointed out in his recent Nagpur speech that attempts have been made to drag the RSS name into electoral politics. Those opposed to the RSS and the BJP were behind this conspiracy. Now, the narrative being shared is that of the RSS and the BJP being pitted against each other. This conspiracy must be unravelled, and it is important not to get swayed by those trying to undermine the gigantic nationalist effort to rebuild India led by the RSS-BJP.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Priyanka Gandhi has repeatedly said, \"I will do anything to help my brother. I will do anything he requires me to do.\" Her entire politics revolves around making Rahul Gandhi a success. Purely in functional terms, Priyanka has always addressed Rahul as ‘my leader’ in recognition of his political heft and being the former president of the AICC. On June 17, 2024, when Rahul was in a dilemma and in some sort of discomfort over quitting Wayanad Lok Sabha that had elected him in 2019, Priyanka came to his rescue, accepting party chief Mallikarjun Kharge’s proposal that she should fight Wayanad by-polls. If Priyanka wins Wayanad , she would be joining the league of Madhavrao Scindia and Vasundhara Raje Scindia as the brother-sister duo in the Lok Sabha. However, one notable difference is that Madhavrao and Vasundhara were on the opposite sides of the political spectrum and lacked the Rahul-Priyanka bhai-behen ki jodi warmth and understanding. Scindias score over Gandhis Incidentally, contrary to popular perception, members of the Nehru-Gandhi family are way behind the house of Scindias in having uninterrupted presence in power, first as monarchs (representatives of God on earth) and in post-independence India, as janpratinidhi or humble jan sewaks . In 1731, when Ranoji Scindia established the Scindia dynasty, for nearly 300 years now, they received the adulation of their subjects. In purely electoral terms, the Scindias score over the Nehru–Gandhi family for their uninterrupted stint in Parliament or in a state assembly. When the Gwalior state merged with the union of India, Jiwajirao George Scindia was made ‘Rajya Pramukh’ (governor). Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia became Congress MP in 1957 and subsequently kept winning various elections as Bharatiya Jan Sangh and Swatantra Party representative, even as her son Madhavrao joined politics, winning 1971, 1977 and all other subsequent Lok Sabha polls till 2001. His sisters Vasundhara and Yashodhara Raje Scindia made forays into electoral politics even as Jyotiraditya Scindia took the mantle of Scindia's political legacy. Between 1991 and 1996, nobody from the Gandhi family was a member of parliament. Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in May 1991 and Maneka Gandhi had lost as a Janata Dal candidate from Pilibhit in the general election that year. During an interview in April 2009, Priyanka Gandhi said, “Frankly, I’m not sure I’ve figured out why myself, but I’m very clear I don’t want to be in politics. I’m very happy living my life the way I am. I think there are certain aspects of politics which I’m just not suited to.” Echoes of the past The Congress has a rich history of Nehru-Gandhi family members working as a “pair”. When Priyanka formally joined politics in 2019, it was not the first time that two family members of the Nehru-Gandhi family were holding high posts together. In 1959, Indira became Congress president, much to the surprise of many in the party when her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, was prime minister. Nehru's detractors had viewed the development as the then prime minister's bid to push his daughter into the coveted post. But a large section of Congressmen of that era had felt that Indira had earned her post through merit. They had reason to say so. As AICC chief, Indira tackled the Kerala crisis and recommended creation of Maharashtra and Gujarat to end the linguistic trouble there. When her term ended in 1960, the Congress Working Committee tried hard, requesting Indira to stand for re-run but she declined firmly. Her son Sanjay Gandhi did not opt for a formal post in the Congress (except for a brief stint as AICC general secretary) but was considered at par with Indira in many organisational and administrative matters. In fact, weeks before he died in a fatal air-crash in June 1980, associate Ram Chandra Rath was viewing Sanjay as party president. Rath used to say, “Subhas Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru became AICC leaders at a very young age. So, if the party elected him president, it's perfectly democratic. There is nothing wrong with that.” Sanjay’s brother Rajiv Gandhi became AICC general secretary in 1983 when Indira was prime minister. He was given a room at 24, Akbar Road, next to Indira’s. Rajiv's words mattered the most and several ministers in Indira’s cabinet were often seen waiting outside his office. Sonia’s own functional relationship with Rahul between 2006-2014 saw a clear demarcation when UPA ministers, other than those belonging to Team Rahul (younger lot like Ajay Makan, RPN Singh, Milind Deora, Sachin Pilot) were not encouraged to call on him. Road ahead for Priyanka Gandhi Ten years of UPA rule (2004-2014) did not enhance Rahul’s political stature. Rather, it made a somewhat promising politician appear as a confused, reluctant and often non-serious character. In this sense, Rahul’s subsequent task was to restore the aura of a credible, 24x7 politician, earn respect from his fellow partymen and demonstrate his capability to defeat the BJP. June 2024 has provided him with that opportunity when Rahul has a chance to become a shadow prime minister and the visible face of the Opposition if he becomes Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. With Priyanka as a backbencher, Rahul would have her support each time he takes on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Congress’s strength of 102 members is going to be enthused by Priyanka’s presence. The combined opposition has about 260 MPs, giving Rahul enough cushion to lead an all-out attack. Both inside and outside parliament, Priyanka would be playing the role of Ahmed Patel as a key strategist, crisis manager, consensus builder plus an effective campaigner for the ensuing assembly polls of Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir. Within the Congress Parivar, she has developed a knack of effective listening post and team leader. In India's 77 years of post-independence (from British rule in 1947) history, Gandhis have led the Congress for 59 years. Congressmen of all hues and shades look up to the Gandhi family members as unquestionable leaders and, in return, expect electoral success, power etc. From Jawaharlal Nehru to Indira, Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi, no Gandhi membership has failed or abruptly opted out of politics. As a result, Congress leaders blindly follow them and do not wish to look beyond Gandhis. Gandhis, like Rahul and now Priyanka , have to live with this illusion of grandeur and prove Congressmen’s’ political instincts right."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story With Narendra Modi becoming Prime Minister for the third time, there has been extensive discussion on the Union Council of Ministers under a coalition government. We looked at the Cabinet — the most powerful, senior-most ministers — in 2014, when Modi first became Prime Minister and at the end of the first term in 2019, then at the start of the second term and the end of the second term in 2024, and the new batch after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Has there been a continuity in the strength, composition, and diversity? Or has a change emerged? From 2014 to 2024, three ministers have been part of all Cabinets: Narendra Modi, Rajnath Singh, and Nitin Gadkari. Three others, now Cabinet ministers, have been in the Council of Ministry since the first Modi government in 2014. What makes Nirmala Sitharaman, Piyush Goyal, and Dharmendra Pradhan different is that they started in 2014 as Ministers of State (with independent charges) and went on to be promoted to the Cabinet later. Thus, one-fifth of the present Cabinet has served in all three Modi governments. When Narendra Modi assumed office in 2014, he had a Cabinet of 26 ministers. By the end of the term, the Cabinet strength remained at 26 though there were several entries and exits. When Modi assumed office a second time in 2019, he had a 25-member Cabinet. At the end of the second term in 2024, the cabinet size had increased to 27. During the five years, many were added, and some demitted office. The new Cabinet just sworn in has 31 ministers. Thus, the size of the cabinet over the decade has ranged from 25 to 31. In the 2014 Cabinet, most members had won the Lok Sabha elections, and only five ministers were from the Rajya Sabha. At the end of the first term, the number of Rajya Sabha members on this list rose to 11 and those from the Lok Sabha fell to 15. When the second Modi Cabinet was formed, Lok Sabha members rose to 18 and Rajya Sabha members were limited to seven. By the end of the term, Rajya Sabha members in the Cabinet rose once again to 11 and Lok Sabha members fell to 16. In the new 31-member Modi cabinet , 24 are Lok Sabha members and only seven are from the Rajya Sabha. Notably, four Cabinet ministers who were Rajya Sabha members contested the 2024 elections and entered the Lok Sabha. The pattern is clear: during a term, when the Cabinet is reshuffled, more Rajya Sabha members are introduced; and after a fresh victory, more Lok Sabha members are inducted. In 2014, there were four non-BJP Cabinet ministers. When the first term ended, the Cabinet had only three non-BJP ministers. The number remained unchanged when the Cabinet was formed after the 2019 elections. It is important to note that at the end of its second term, there was no non-BJP minister in the Cabinet. The lone non-BJP Cabinet minister towards the fag-end — Pashupati Paras — resigned from the government in March 2024. That right now there’s a genuine coalition government is evident from the presence of five non-BJP ministers in the new Cabinet. That explains why the complexion of the Modi Cabinet looks quite different before and after the elections. Continuity and change can be seen from another lens. Of the outgoing Cabinet at the end of its first term in 2019, only 16 of the 26 ministers returned. Of the 10 who did not find a place in the second Modi cabinet, two did not contest the Lok Sabha polls, one was defeated, and seven were dropped even though they either won the Lok Sabha elections or remained Rajya Sabha members. Similarly, when the term of the second Modi cabinet ended in 2024, 20 of the 27 ministers were retained. Seven ministers were dropped. Two won the Lok Sabha elections but were not included in the cabinet. One (a Rajya Sabha member) contested the Lok Sabha elections and was not included in the Cabinet even though he won. Four cabinet ministers lost the Lok Sabha polls and were dropped. Thus, there is high turnover when one compares the Modi Cabinet formed after an election. If one were to look at the first Modi Cabinet in 2014, the ministers hailed from just 10 states. At the end of its first term, this rose to 11 states. When the second Modi cabinet was formed in 2019, ministers hailed from 14 states. At the end of the second term, this became 16 states. This time, the Cabinet has ministers from 18 states. Some states, however, have never had a Cabinet minister in the Modi government. These include Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Goa, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Tripura, Manipur, Nagaland, Sikkim, Meghalaya, and Mizoram. The Union Territories (Delhi not included) also have not been represented in the Union Cabinet. This may well reflect either the electoral support that the NDA has secured or the small size of the state. In some cases, representation has been provided as Ministers of State. Thus, a review of the Modi cabinet indicates more adjustment to change with the changing political and electoral context, with core continuity across the decade."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Every six months or so, or whenever there are elections in India, EVM hacking becomes the talk of the town. This time around, just days after our General Elections have concluded, it has become the talk of not just the town but the entire world. Thanks to Elon Musk . Last week, with an eye on the upcoming US elections and probably with not a single thought related to India, Musk tweeted, \"We should eliminate electronic voting machines. The risk of being hacked by humans or AI, while small, is still too high.\" And then he doubled down in another tweet, saying, \"Anything can be hacked.” Little did Musk know that whenever, and in whichever corner of the world, someone says the words EVM and hacking, it immediately makes millions of Indians sit upright, grab their keyboards and start hammering. And hammering Indians did, with hundreds of thousands quote tweeting Musk and smugly channeling their inner I-told-you-so persona. One among these was Rahul Gandhi, who quoted Musk and tweeted, \"EVMs in India are a black box, and nobody is allowed to scrutinise them.\" But where there is one group, it's obvious that the other one too would swarm. Thousands of Indians also took to their keyboards and slammed Musk, telling him how wrong he was. One of these was former IT minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar who said a lot of things in response to Musk , including this bit: \"I think he is factually incorrect in saying that anything can be hacked. A calculator or toaster cannot be hacked.” So, who is right and who is wrong? The truth, as it often happens, lies somewhere in the middle, in that nuanced space which one cannot find in the black and white world of Twitter feuds. But before I talk of that, let me deal with calculators. Yes, calculators. Calculators, or at least some of them, can indeed be hacked. Between 2000 and 2015, there was even a group of people who were actively hacking calculators and having fun at the expense of companies that made them. One incident made news around the world in July 2009 when a hacker named Benjamin Moody cracked the cryptographic key of Texas Instrument 83 calculator and then made it do things it wasn't supposed to do. This led to Texas Instrument legally going after the hackers who were tinkering with its calculators. The clash made some news and offered a lot of lulz — like a hacker would say — to a lot of geeks. So yes, some calculators can be hacked. But EVMs? Whether EVMs can be hacked or not, and whether Indian EVMs in particular can be hacked or not, is a question that cannot be answered definitively. The reason for that is the \"black box\" part in Rahul Gandhi's tweet. He might be wrong but it is indeed true that we do not have enough information in the public domain to ascertain whether Indian EVMs are as safe and secure as some people believe them to be. At the same time, we cannot also say that they are not safe. We just don't have enough information and this, I believe, the Election Commission India (ECI) should fix. Having said that, and to be specific to last week's EVM brouhaha involving Musk, Chandrasekhar, Rahul Gandhi and others, it is fair to believe that both camps are right. The dichotomy — as well as the confusion — is the result of how word hacking is perceived by Musk and how it is defined by Chandrasekhar. It is due to these different definitions of \"Hacking\" that we have two camps who hold contrasting opinions and yet both are likely right. For people like Elon Musk, who is not just a part of Silicon Valley, but who has since his college days worked with computers, machines and code, the word hacking means making a machine do something that it is not built to do. And not just machines, but any object do something that it is not designed to do. The word is part of Silicon Valley parlance, a part of its culture that extends back to the 1970s and 80s. People at that time, including people like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, were all hackers. Heck, Steve Jobs was even \"hacking\" his body by going on fad diets and eating apples — only apples — for days. In the early days of Silicon Valley, geeks were doing things with rudimentary computers such as Altair 8800 — barely as powerful as a basic calculator — that were possible only if they \"hacked\" into it. That 70s hacking culture was directly responsible for the computer revolution that followed. The whole epoch was captured brilliantly by Steven Levy in his books Hackers, published in 1984. Levy writes in it, \"Hackers can do almost anything and be a hacker. You can be a hacker carpenter. It's not necessarily high-tech.” Seen from this point of view, it is easy to understand why technologists who are steeped in Silicon Valley culture tend to say something like \"anything can be hacked\", just the way Musk did. If you ask Elon Musk whether a cycle can be hacked or not, or whether a fountain pen can be hacked or not, his answer most likely will be yes. Hacking for him is simply a matter of modifying something and making it do things it is not originally created to do. But hacking, the way most people here in India understand, is something to do with this idea of bypassing the security of a device through a network and then modifying it. The idea of hackers that we have comes from Hollywood films, where a lonely man sits in shadows in his basement and then types fast and furious on his keyboard to bypass passwords on a bank server. And because many in India have this particular notion of hackers and hacking, they tend to argue that EVMs cannot be hacked because they aren't even connected to any network — wired or wireless. Yet, people who believe EVMs in India cannot be hacked are also probably right. This is because if it doesn't connect to a network, and if its chip is barely programmable, then the only way it can be \"hacked\" is at an institutional level and with physical access to it. It's not that something like this is not possible, it is just that in India, where the opposition has their polling agents at every step of the election process, hacking of EVMs probably seems like a tin-foil theory instead of reality. The only issue is that elections — and moreover the impression of them being free and fair — is too important to be paired with the word \"probably\". This is the word that, I believe, the ECI should deal with. This is possible only if there is more information about the workings of the Indian EVMs. It is true that Indian EVMs do not have network connectivity. But they do have a programmable chip, which uses — probably a very lightweight — firmware to carry out instructions. We don't know what goes into this firmware, how secure it is and what it can do or not do. Similarly, we don't have enough details of EVM hardware in the public domain. The ECI has a lengthy FAQ section on its website, but it is full of many words that don't say much. The reason why this issue keeps cropping, even though there is probably no boogeyman in EVMs, is because for some reason or other, the ECI has always been cagey about sharing finer details. Fix that and you would fix the EVM hacking debates. (Javed Anwer is Technology Editor, India Today Group Digital. He has been writing about personal technology and gadgets since 2005)"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story For centuries, in pursuit of well-being, people have looked up. This has brought a lot of hallucinations as people have imagined all kinds of things. And, it has created a continuous war between one kind of heaven and another kind. They are fighting over God or a heaven, that both of them have not seen, but are willing to fight to death. In recent times, there has been a shift towards seeking well-being from the outside world. Thus, in the process of trying to extract the juice of life from outside, we are destroying the very source of our life – the planet itself. Today, as societies evolve into higher levels of economic well-being, comfort, and technologies, every kind of possible convenience that could not have been imagined, are available. But well-being has still not been achieved. Mental health issues are increasing across the planet in such a way that it is no more an individual experience – it has become a societal experience. It is expected that in the next 15 to 20 years, there may hardly be any family left without at least one person who hasn’t been affected by mental health issues. We must understand that all human experience – pain or pleasure, joy or misery, agony or ecstasy – is caused from within. Once you realise this, yoga becomes very relevant because it is a technology, a tool for people to turn inward and create their own well-being. The process of yoga is the science of inner management as you create a possibility where being blissful, joyful, peaceful is by your own nature, and not because of something that happens around you. Your life is no more in pursuit of happiness but an expression of your happiness. The message of yoga is this: “Not up, not out – in. The only way out is in.” Unfortunately, just some time ago, if you had visited an Indian village, people would not have heard of the word ‘yoga’, but they would have heard of Coca-Cola. The marketing of Coca-Cola has been so effective, but we have been shy to market yoga and other aspects of our culture that are valuable to us. We think that the moment we market something, it becomes corrupt. But, how would you know there is something valuable otherwise? My way of looking at life is that if there is water in my well, and you are thirsty, it is my business to go on to my rooftop and shout that there is water here. But if you think you are very civilised, and you do not say anything, people will die of thirst. There is an inner strength in Indian culture that stems from a whole science and technology of inner well-being - right now, the entire world is crying for it. The United Nations’ declaration of June 21 as the International Day of Yoga is very significant in this context, though most people may not understand it right now. They may think there is a Bubble Bath Day, Mother's Day and all kinds of days, but this is not one more thing like that. This is recognition of an ancient science, which we have used for our physiological, psychological and spiritual well-being for thousands of years. This recognition has definitely made yoga appeal to the world in a bigger way than ever before. Today, the entire world knows at least the word ‘yoga’, even if they do not know the process or practice it. The International Day of Yoga is another opportunity to spread the message that every human being can improve their own well-being. They need not wait for some other force who is responsible for their well-being. It is also a commitment to take full responsibility for your own well-being and, in turn, the well-being of the world.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Rushikonda in Telugu translates to 'Hill of the Sages'. But the resort on Rushikonda in Visakhapatnam, now more commonly and disparagingly referred to as 'the Jagan palace' on social media, is anything but saintly. Built on a sprawling 9.88 acres, the estimated cost is Rs 365 crore as per official records, though Telugu Desam estimates put the figure at Rs 550 crore. At one point in time, the Andhra Pradesh Tourism's Haritha Resorts stood at the same spot, on top of a hill overlooking the Bay of Bengal. The modest facility was redeveloped in 2021, ostensibly to create a plush resort with premium villas and beach-facing suites. What emerged, however, was a magnificent structure consisting of as many as seven blocks . Construction work took place in the utmost secrecy with the place out of bounds for everyone. A senior police officer who has visited the resort several times in the last year to check it from the security point of view said the resort now includes space for security personnel, chambers for secretaries to the chief minister, the Chief Minister's office, space for guests and finally, the Chief Minister's residence. Besides, the blocks also offer facilities such as fitness centres, cafeteria and banquet halls. Why this has blown into an ugly controversy is because of the kind of money that has been splurged on it. It is opulent and fit for a king of a flourishing kingdom, not the chief minister of a state that is scraping the bottom of its exchequer. Besides, the project was completed despite several environment-related petitions filed against it including one for alleged violations of the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules. The YSRCP also never came clean on the actual purpose of creating such a lavish structure. Even as neutral bureaucrats confirm that it was intended for the purpose of housing the Chief Minister - if Jagan returned to power in 2024 - and his camp office, YSRCP has argued that the President and Prime Minister of India could stay there instead of hotels in Vizag when they came visiting. It has also cited it as a move to promote tourism in the coastal city that was announced as the Executive capital of Andhra Pradesh by the Jagan regime. Under fire after the inside of the building was shown to the world, the YSRCP said the building is a government asset and not anyone's private property. A detailed inquiry which is due to be ordered, will bring out how the Finance and Tourism departments sanctioned budgets way beyond what rules of the Roads and Buildings department stipulate. Under government rules, standard rates are fixed for every aspect of construction of a government building - what kind of bathroom tiles, sanitary ware, flooring, paint and the works - and contractors are bound to follow that. If there is a deviation from the norm, appropriate government orders and note files from the competent authority have to reflect it. Politically, if the June 4 results of the Andhra Pradesh assembly election where the YSRCP was reduced to a paltry 11 seats was a body blow, the party and Jagan personally seem to have lost the battle of public perception over the Rushikonda property. The ruling Telugu Desam and Jana Sena are going to town telling the people that this is the way Jagan administered the state by splurging on his personal comfort by spending crores of taxpayers and public money. In a very ironic way, 2024 is also proving to be a mirror image of 2019. Soon after taking over as Chief Minister five years ago, Jagan had ordered the demolition of the Praja Vedika, a convention hall built by the previous Chandrababu Naidu regime at a cost of Rs 8.9 crore, citing illegalities in construction. The YSRCP had also sought to harass Naidu alleging that the Undavalli residence where he stays on rent, was built on a riverbed in violation of environmental norms. The then chairman of the AP State Capital Region Development Authority, Alla Ramakrishna Reddy, had even threatened to evict Naidu from his residence. The shaming of Jagan over Rushikonda is a classic political tit-for-tat. In Tadepalli near Vijayawada, the road adjoining Jagan's present residence has now been opened for the public after being closed for the past five years. Jagan largely functioned from the camp office at Tadepalli and came to the Secretariat complex in Velagapudi only for Cabinet meetings and Assembly sessions. From a public point of view, this is akin to what happened in Hyderabad after the defeat of the BRS. Pragati Bhavan, the official residence of the Telangana chief minister was fortified with huge iron structures when K Chandrasekhar Rao was at the helm of affairs. These structures occupied a significant part of the main road, leading to clogging up of traffic and putting commuters to inconvenience. When the Congress came to power in December 2023, it ordered the removal of the barricades. Jagan is also being accused of ‘furniture theft’ as official furnishing is still being used at the Tadepalli camp office of the former chief minister. The Education and IT minister, Nara Lokesh, sought to embarrass Jagan by asking when he would return the furniture. Though the YSRCP has offered to pay for the furniture, this is a deja vu moment for the party because five years ago, the former Speaker of the Andhra Pradesh assembly Kodela Sivaprasad Rao was similarly accused by it of not returning furniture he used while in office. Rao was shamed by the YSRCP on social media and called a ‘furniture thief’. Rao killed himself in September 2019. Faced with these bouncers, Jagan will have to decide whether to attend the first session of the Assembly. He is bound to take oath as a newly elected MLA, but whether he would want to do that in the face of inevitable jeers from the treasury benches, is a question he only has the answer to. If Jagan chooses not to attend, he would have to go to the CBI court in Hyderabad that is due to resume hearing in the cases filed against him on Friday."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The president of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) and deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar’s whirlwind tour of around 15 temples in the Channapatna Assembly constituency on Wednesday and the emotional statements he made at several pit-stops along the route, clearly indicate that he is keen on ‘fighting’ the upcoming by-election from Channapatna to re-establish his credentials as the ‘real’ leader of the Vokkaliga community. The by-election is due to be notified by the Election Commission of India as Union Minister for Heavy Industries and Steel HD Kumaraswamy vacated the seat on being elected to the Lok Sabha from Mandya. Two other Assembly seats vacated by Basavaraj Bommai of BJP (Haveri) and E Tukaram of the Congress (Sandur) will also face by-elections. In the recent Lok Sabha elections, Shivakumar had suffered a double blow with the defeat of his brother DK Suresh from Bengaluru Rural and his arch rival HD Kumaraswamy’s resounding victory from the Mandya constituency. It shattered his dream of emerging as the “supreme leader” of the Vokkaligas in the Old Mysuru region and staking his claim for chief ministership. Invoking Kengal’s legacy Shivakumar began his temple tour from Kengal Anjaneyaswamy temple to underscore the significance of his visit. Late Kengal Hanumanthaiah, the second chief minister of Karnataka (then Mysore) from 1952 to 1956, was among the tallest leaders from Karnataka, who also served in the Central cabinets of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi with distinction. Hanumanthaiah belonged to the powerful Vokkaliga caste, though he was respected across communities. After offering prayers at the Kengal temple, Shivakumar told a large gathering of the media: “I’m not disappointed with my brother DK Suresh’s defeat in the Lok Sabha election. It happened because of our own mistakes which we will rectify. I have come to this temple as I want to start a new chapter in my political career.” Buttressing his links to Channapatna, he pointed out that one hobli of Channapatna was earlier (before delimitation in 2008) part of Sathanur constituency which he had represented in the Assembly four times. “The people of Channapatna have been with me during my tough times and I have a debt to repay them.” If that wasn’t a sufficient enough hint, he told a reporter who asked him what he would do if the people of Channapatna wanted him to contest: “There will be no other way. I will have to listen to what my party and voters say.” Time to settle scores Sources close to Shivakumar said he was yet to discuss the issue with the party high command but given his closeness and ‘clout’ with the Gandhi family, he was unlikely to be denied an opportunity to contest from Channapatna if he finally decides so. After the stunning losses in the Lok Sabha polls, Shivakumar has been itching to ‘settle scores’ with the Deve Gowda family and Channapatna offers him an immediate opportunity to do it. The decision, whenever taken, will not be without risks or complications. Shivakumar, who was elected to the Karnataka Assembly from Kanakapura constituency in May 2023, will have to resign that seat leading to another by-election. It appears that he wants to field his brother DK Suresh from Kanakapura. Dr CN Manjunath, a popular cardiologist making his political debut, had defeated Suresh in the Bengaluru Rural Lok Sabha seat by over 2.6 lakh margin. That Dr Manjunath was a BJP candidate, apart from being Deve Gowda’s son-in-law and Kumaraswamy’s brother-in-law did not go well with Shivakumar. It seems that as the first family of the Congress party is getting ready to field Priyanka Gandhi from Wayanad in Kerala, vacated by Rahul Gandhi in favour of Rae Bareli, Shivakumar’s switch is unlikely to face any hitch as Priyanka will need his ‘support’ for her own maiden entry to the parliament from Kerala. Tough fight on the cards Political observers point out that Channapatna will not be a cakewalk for Shivakumar, as his opponents are also gearing up for a tough fight. Having won the recent Lok Sabha election from Mandya by a huge margin, Kumaraswamy will be keen to retain his hegemony in the old Mysuru region. Further, his supporters have received a morale boost with Kumaraswamy’s inclusion in the Modi cabinet and much is expected of him as a Union minister. Initially, it appeared that Kumaraswamy wanted his son Nikhil to take his seat in Channapatna, but with the likely entry of Shivakumar, he may change his plans. As the BJP and JD(S) had contested the last elections in an alliance, there is a possibility of Channapatna being contested by CP Yogeshwar of the BJP. Yogeshwar, who has been a ‘frequent flyer’ between parties over the last two decades of his political career, has won four times from Channapatna as an independent or representing the Congress, the BJP or the Samajwadi Party (when late Mulayam Sigh Yadav headed the party). In the 2019 Assembly polls he, as a BJP nominee, gave a tough fight to Kumaraswamy in Channapatna and lost by a small margin of 16,000 votes. As the bitter rivalry between chief minister Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar remains no secret, Shivakumar’s latest ‘gamble’ has evoked much interest in the chief minister’s camp, though there has been no reaction yet. Siddaramaiah’s close associate-minister, KN Rajanna, had recently again mooted the idea of having two deputy chief ministers apart from Shivakumar, but before that balloon could take off, Shivakumar has sprung a surprise by expressing his desire to contest from Channapatna. There’s never a dull moment in Karnataka’s politics!"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has levelled serious accusations against the Jagan Mohan Reddy-led Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP), claiming the party had illicitly acquired prime lands in Andhra while it was in power. TDP alleged that the lands worth hundreds of crores in all 26 district headquarters of Andhra Pradesh were acquired by YSRCP under the guise of constructing party offices. According to TDP, senior officials have initiated an investigation into the land acquisitions following the demolition of YSRCP's offices. The probe is being conducted into how the party acquired the lands. The lands valued between Rs 900 crore and Rs 1,000 crore, were allegedly allocated by former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy without obtaining proper permissions. These allocations reportedly include properties belonging to the Irrigation and Endowments departments, circumventing legal procedures. The TDP claimed the construction of each YSRCP office building, featuring luxurious interiors and furnishings, costs between Rs 15 crore and Rs 20 crore, with the total expenditure surpassing Rs 2,000 crore. Specific instances cited by the TDP include: -Kakinada: A YSRCP office is being constructed on two acres of land at 22A, Paida Vari Street, a restricted area. There are also allegations that the party attempted to secure a bank loan using this property. -Parvathipuram Manyam: An office building is being erected on 1.18 acres in New Belagam. It was previously intended for a farmers' training center under the Water Resources Department. -Anakapalli: A YSRCP office was built on land previously designated for a guard house. -Narsaraopeta: 1.50 acres of Agraharam land were allocated for a YSRCP office building. -Bapatla: Construction of a YSRCP office building is underway. -West Godavari: A YSRCP office is being constructed in Undi mandal NRP Agrahar. -Krishna: A completed YSRCP office on a two-acre plot valued over Rs 60 crore in the bustling district court center of Machilipatnam. -Tirupati: A YSRCP office has been built on two acres of land belonging to the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) in the Industrial Estate of Kurrakalva, Renigunta Mandal. -YSR Kadapa District: A YSRCP office building has already been constructed. The TDP's allegations come after backlash over demolition of an under-construction office of the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) at Tadepalli in Guntur district. The TDP said the property in question was demolished as it was being built \"illegally\" on the Irrigation Department's land. Meanwhile, Jagan Reddy accused Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu of \"taking vendetta politics to the next level\" and \"acting like a dictator\"."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A magistrate court on Sunday sent Janata Dal (Secular) MLC Suraj Revanna to judicial custody for 14 days in connection with a sexual assault case filed by a party worker. Suraj Revanna is the brother of former Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna, who was arrested last month in sex assault cases. Revanna was arrested earlier in the day at the Cyber Economic and Narcotics Crime (CEN) police station in Karnataka's Hassan district. He had gone to the police station in connection with a blackmail case filed by him and one of his acquaintances, Shivakumar, against the complainant. According to sources, Hassan SP Sujeetha Mohammed directed senior officials to reach the police station, and it took four hours to arrest Suraj Revanna. A party worker had filed an FIR against the JD(S) MLC on Saturday alleging that he was sexually assaulted by him at his farmhouse on June 16. However, Suraj Revanna has categorically denied the charge. He alleged that the man had filed a false complaint in a bid to extort Rs 5 crore from him. Suraj Revanna had filed a complaint in this regard on Friday, a day before sexual assault case was filed by the man. The JD(S) worker in his complaint alleged that Suraj Revanna had invited him to his farmhouse on June 16, where he forcefully kissed him and bit his lips and cheeks. The complainant had further alleged that Suraj threatened to kill him if he didn't cooperate. He also said that Suraj then sexually assaulted him, following which he told him that he would help him in growing politically in the district. He said in the complaint that he had texted Suraj about the incident later, and Suraj had replied, \"Don’t worry, everything will be fine.\" The Holenarasipura police registered a case against Suraj Revanna under Sections 377 (unnatural offences), 342 (wrongful confinement), and 506 (criminal intimidation), based on the complaint. Notably, Suraj Revanna's brother, Prajwal, is in jail in connection with separate sexual assault cases. Prajwal Revanna, who was the NDA Lok Sabha candidate from Hassan, fled the country on April 27 after several videos purportedly featuring him sexually harassing multiple women emerged. He was arrested by SIT officials upon his return from Germany on May 31. Prajwal Revanna's father, HD Revanna, was also arrested last month in connection with cases of sexual harassment and kidnapping. He was granted bail days after his arrest."

Thirty-one months later, Naidu fulfilled his vow and returned to the state Assembly as Chief Minister. Chandrababu Naidu, who was the Leader of the Opposition in 2021, had said that he was pained by the continuous slur on him by the then ruling YSR Congress members. Making a reference to the epic Mahabharat, Naidu had pointed out that even Lord Krishna could not stop the Kauravas from hurling gross insults at Draupadi. \"In this Kaurava Sabha of YSRCP, there is no 'Gauravam' (respect) for elected representatives of the people,\" he had said. As he continued to speak about the attack on his family, the then Speaker Tammineni Seetaram cut the mike and the ruling party members called Naidu’s remarks a “drama”. Over two years after the incident went down, Naidu’s party stormed Andhra Pradesh and the TDP chief took oath as MLA on Friday. #WATCH | Hon'ble Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu Garu takes oath as MLA as Assembly session commences. pic.twitter.com/7MlbbqtQ5A — CMO Andhra Pradesh (@AndhraPradeshCM) June 21, 2024 The inaugural session of the 16th Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly commenced on Friday, with 172 newly-elected legislators taking their oaths. Following the oath-taking, the pro tem Speaker adjourned the House until 10:30 am on Saturday. The election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker did not take place during this session. TDP leader Nara Lokesh, Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan, and others submitted nominations for the Speaker’s post on behalf of TDP’s Narsipatnam MLA C Ayyannapatrudu. YSRCP supremo YS Jagan Mohan Reddy also attended the session and took his oath as an MLA.

Padmanabham, a Kapu community leader and former minister, joined the YSRCP a few months before the elections."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Twenty-three-year-old Bahaz Uddin isn’t sure if his house will survive the next rains, but his most immediate concern is the village volleyball team. Bahaz Uddin is from Majar Char, one of the scores of shape-shifting riverine islands in the Brahmaputra. If the chars (river islands) owe their origins to the Brahmaputra, they are threatened by the mighty river too. While Bahaz Uddin is worried about his house being swept away by the river when it swells in the next rain, his most immediate concern is the volleyball training of the village kids and their performance in the Brahmaputra Volleyball League. Like most riverine islands, Majar Char in Barpeta district, is among the lesser developed areas of Assam. It takes 30 minutes by motorised boat to reach the nearest mainland. Most children and teenagers of Majar Char haven’t set foot outside their island. Hope, however, has reached them in the form of the Brahmaputra Volleyball League (BVL), a community initiative that provides ball and coaching to village children in areas where families can’t afford shoes for the kids. Started during the Covid lockdown in 2020 by Abhijit Bhattacharya, the only player from Assam to captain Team India, training tea garden kids with balls made from cloth, the Brahmaputra Volleyball League now has sponsors from abroad. Not only that. The unique grassroots sports movement has put Assam, a state that has a near-zero presence in national volleyball, on the global volleyball map. The Fédération International de Volleyball (FIVB), the apex global governing body of volleyball, found the BVL model so unique that it sent three Olympic Gold Medallists from Cuba, Brazil and Serbia and an expert from the Netherlands to Assam to train the Brahmaputra Volleyball League coaches. A post by Fédération Internationale de Volleyball. People from abroad are also sponsoring the Assam village kids now. From the year-round training of thousands of children to the hundreds of matches in the BVL season to the community efforts in facilitating the games to the live-streaming of all the matches, Brahmaputra Volleyball League is nothing short of a revolution. A revolution, which is slowly changing villages and will soon be visible nationally. No one imagined that an endeavour to provide balls for village children would become an international phenomenon. “We started with a mission to collect 100 balls. It was called Assam Volleyball Mission 100,” Abhijit Bhattacharya, founder of BVL and former India Team player, tells IndiaToday.In. After providing balls to the children, the mission then changed to training them. Trained, children need to display their skills. Thus, the Brahmaputra Volleyball League was born. The idea was to get children to play and expend energy positively. Bhattacharya also had the idea that children who did not have enough educational support could use sports to get jobs. More than spotting talent, the Brahmaputra Volleyball League (BVL) is about creating the environment for sports in villages. Several villagers told IndiaToday.In how BVL has been transformative, teenagers have given up chewing tobacco and started focusing on volleyball. It is, in fact, the village community that is BVL’s backbone. Villagers prepare the grounds, ensure adequate lighting facilities, encourage children to practice regularly, and host teams from other villages during the BVL match season. “When volleyball teams from Barpeta and Balagaon came to play in our village, we prepared a sumptuous lunch of rice, dal, potato fry, fish and chicken. Villagers pooled in money and took care of the feast,” says Bahaz Uddin of Majar Char. It is actually village pride that works here. “The villagers say take as much money as is needed but guests visiting our Char shouldn’t feel neglected,” says Bahaz Uddin. Usually, the women of the village get together and cook a feast for the visitors. At times, guests are also treated to cultural programmes that include Bihu dance. The Brahmaputra Volleyball League has matches in the home and away format of teams of girls and boys in the under-12 and under-16 age groups. Top teams from the villages compete in the 60-match Super League. “You can even support BVL by giving a banana,” requested Bhattacharya when the initiative started. It doesn’t cost much to sponsor a village team and the money is used for the children’s transport needs, kits and nets. “Individual sponsors are from across the world, they are Indians and non-Indians. They get to know about BVL through word of mouth or social media and come forward to help. We don’t have any marketing team, we simply don’t have the money for that,” says Abhijit Bhattacharya. The only salaried employee of BVL is Tezpur-based Jayanta Sarma. He is the person who coordinates with the hundreds of villages and plans the matches. Other than several celebrated national-level players like Aparna Popat and Krishna Hazarika Rao and other Indians, there are people from the US, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, Singapore and Qatar sponsoring the village teams. Bhattacharya, however, insists it is the community that is the biggest sponsor. “Community is the biggest sponsor because it is them who arrange the ground, community meals and take care of the small and regular needs of the kids. That’s why we say 'People of the World Presents BVL',” says Bhattacharya. The village gets together to prepare a community feast for the visiting team. It's a matter of village pride in Assam and guests should leave satisfied. Now, several corporate players are also joining hands to help in the grassroots community initiative. Vector X is the official ball partner of BVL Season 4 and is providing 1,600 volleyball balls. Signify, formerly Philips Lighting, is providing LED lights and poles in 30 village grounds and lights for 100 villages. In the Super League last year, Oil India (OIL) provided accommodation and playing ground in Duliajan. Since it started with 50 teams from 34 villages, BVL has now spread to 158 villages in 28 of Assam’s 31 districts. In Season 4 of BVL, close to 900 matches will be played between October 15, when the tournament started, and the final in March 2024. “We have volunteers in each district, who visit the grounds during match days. The match officials for most of the tournament are arranged by the in-charge of the local team from a pool of qualified personnel in their neighbourhood,” Jayanta Sarma, who manages BVL’s match operations, tells IndiaToday.In. Not only are matches organised like clockwork, but they are all live-streamed too. Live-streaming of the volleyball matches helps sponsors, who are sitting in distant places, see how their teams are performing. It also helps Abhijit Bhattacharya and his team spot talent in far-off villages. But how are matches from far-off places like Majar Char live-streamed? The matches are streamed by village boys and girls on their mobile phones, sometimes using locally designed bamboo, wood or metal tripods and quadrapods. “In BVL Season 2, a group of young volunteers from across Assam were trained in the basics of live broadcasting by Dhatura Films. Our matches are now live-streamed on Sportvot. They provide us with their amazing technology and back-end support,” says Jayanta Sarma. On most weekends, there are numerous matches, sometimes over 100 in a single day. Imagine all those matches being live-streamed. “Brahmaputra Volleyball League is creating not only a grassroots volleyball revolution in Assam, but also an innovative minimal-cost live telecast model,” says Utpal Borpujari, a National Award-winning filmmaker. “Elders have approached us about BVL training centres in their villages after seeing the impact in nearby villages,” says Abhijit Bhattacharya. “Local leadership is developing in villages. The centre manager is coach-cum-manager and takes care of the village teams.” “Villagers have started trusting me more now. They will give me money for volleyball without asking a question,” says Bahaz Uddin, the centre manager of BVL in Majar Char. That is because the villagers are seeing them toil and change the village. “The two estates in Jorhat district where children started playing volleyball with cloth balls during lockdown are regularly participating and organising matches. The places which have never seen a sporting activity, are seeing regular volleyball practice,” says Bhattacharya. It is because of the unique change that BVL is bringing that The Fédération International de Volleyball (FIVB), the apex global governing body of volleyball, sent four international trainers to Assam. “Once FIVB General Director Fabio Azevedo got to know of the grassroots volleyball league run with community intervention, he was very impressed and decided to send three legendary volleyball players to Assam. Olympic Gold Medalists Mariya Luis from Cuba, Vladimir Grbic from Serbia and Giba from Brazil, the former most-valuable player in the world, visited Assam,” says Bhattacharya. Abhijit Bhattacharya with FIVB General Director Fabio Azevedo (R). Giba of Brazil, considered one of the best volleyball players in the world, with children in Assam (L). Through this knowledge-transfer programme, 70 BVL coaches were trained in November and December 2023. “Around 90% of players in the Assam state team in sub-junior and mini categories are BVL children. That goes on to show how talent has been cultivated in a state that saw almost nil volleyball,” says Bhattacharya. “Earlier, in Assam sub-junior inter-district there were 25 teams at most, but after BVL, the number has gone up to 65.” The plan is to build the Assam volleyball team, says Bhattacharya, and win medals in the nationals and place a couple of players in the India team. A girl from the Golaghat BVL team made it to the India camp. It was because of BVL that she got into volleyball in the first place. “BVL isn’t just about identifying and promoting talent, it is about creating a sporting environment in villages,” says Bhattacharya. At Majar Char, Bahaz Uddin’s concern is about his team’s performance. The under-16 team has won three matches and lost one. He wants to train them harder and make it to BVL’s Super League next season. He is also preparing an under-12 team for the next BVL season. “The kids aren’t used to travelling by bus and had motion sickness just before their match,” says Bahaz Uddin about how the Majar Char team lost the ‘away’ game. The ride for the volleyball match was the first trip outside their island for most of the children. Though some fell sick, they enjoyed it thoroughly. “They were on the mainland for the first time. The kids told me that they never enjoyed themselves so much in their lives,” says Bahaz Uddin about the bus ride for the match in Barpeta. That is the power of volleyball, and the Brahmaputra Volleyball League is tapping that and opening a whole new world for the children of lesser gods."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story X has recently announced that the live-streaming feature will soon go behind the paywall. This means that X, formerly Twitter, will become the only channel to charge for a feature which is free on other social media platforms. But this move should not be received as a shocker, as earlier CEO Elon Musk had stated that in the coming future, he will be charging for even the basic features of X. The company took to X and posted, \"Starting soon, only Premium subscribers will be able to livestream (create live video streams) on X. This includes going live from an encoder with X integration.\" It is still unknown why the company is making such changes. There is no explanation from the company or the CEO, so far. No other information has been given. There is no information on when this change will take place. The move has been heavily criticised by the users who use their profile on X as a video first platform. The reactions to this upcoming move have been majorly negative. The main point being that other platforms, even those with a superior user interface and video player, are not charging for the feature. This is not the only indication that X is diving into the pool to charge for more features. Earlier this year, in April, the company introduced a $1 annual fee for new accounts in New Zealand and the Philippines to access the posting privilege. During this time, Elon Musk stated that this was done for testing purposes only. But this does not mean that the company will discontinue it, it means that when they are satisfied, the annual fee will extend to all new accounts globally. This means that the new users in these countries are paying for basic X functionalities, such as posting, liking, bookmarking, or even reposting. He said that all this came at a \"small fee\". If the feature, in future, travels to India, this small fee will be equal to Rs 100. This also suggests a potential shift in X's strategy, moving from a primary advertisement-based model to one that incorporates a mix of advertising and paid subscriptions. Unlike this time, Musk explained the move to charge $1 for basic features. He said that the move is meant to \"curb the relentless onslaught of bots\". He added that the current AI and troll farms can pass the 'are you a bot test' with ease. It will be interesting to see how the users will react to the further upcoming changes and charges powered by X."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Chinese Army has outright refused to agree to any pullback of its troops and vehicles in the Gogra and Hot Springs friction points in eastern Ladakh. Fresh rigidity has brought to a grinding halt the positive momentum that began in February of this year with a significant troop pullback on both sides in the Pangong Tso sector. Top sources in the Indian Army's 14 Corps told India Today, \"The Chinese side appeared for the 11th round of talks on Friday with a predetermined decision to be totally inflexible.\" The 11th round of talks lasted for 13 hours and was the first following the most positive phase in the Ladakh standoff, which resulted in significant disengagement in the tense Pangong area. Still photos now in of the Chinese pullback in Ladakh’s Pangong sectors. Indian high-def cameras keeping tabs on every step. Each vehicle, bunker, tank & troop watched and validated in pullback. Tomorrow the crucial Phase 1 review between both sides. pic.twitter.com/94LOPga67g — Shiv Aroor (@ShivAroor) February 16, 2021 This is the same area in eastern Ladakh where Indian and Chinese troop groups were positioned just tens of meters from each other at some posts. The last round of military talks between India and China was held on February 20 of this year. Satellite imagery had also confirmed the depth and substance of the Chinese disengagement in the Fingers complex on the north shore of the giant Pangong Lake. However, China's amenability in the region has hit a major wall in discussions on the Gogra and Hot Springs areas where troop build-up on both sides remains significant. India had proposed a similar phased reduction of frontline troops and vehicles at these two posts, but China refused to budge. Reacting to the 11th round of talks, the Indian Army said in a statement on Saturday, \"Completion of disengagement in other areas would pave the way for two sides to consider de-escalation of forces and ensure full restoration of peace and tranquility and enable progress in bilateral relations.\" \"The two sides agreed that it was important to take guidance from the consensus of their leaders, continue their communication and dialogue and work towards a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues at the earliest,\" the statement went on to say. The statement was conspicuous by its lack of specifics on forward movement, an indicator of the stalemate at Friday's talks. China remains deployed in significant strength at Gogra, Hot Springs and Kongka La areas, with a large PLA logistics facility supporting troops there. Elements from a motorised infantry division, an artillery brigade and air-defence unit also remain deployed in the area. While there was brief and token pullback of troops in this part of eastern Ladakh after talks following the June 2020 clash in Galwan , the presence has now become a primary tactical problem area. China's inflexibility on Gogra and Hot Springs hasn't been unexpected - the Indian Army has accounted well for China's unpredictable posture at the talks- but the apparent duplicity in agreeing that disengagement is the way forward while not agreeing to actually do it has posed a fresh challenge to forward movement. Apart from the two sectors seeing a stalemate, a discussion on the larger Depsang plains issue is also pending."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 10 May, 2024 ‘The Boy and the Heron’ has finally released in India. Fans of Hayao Miyazaki are familiar with the magic realism he effortlessly weaves in his films, such as ‘My Neighbor Totoro,’ ‘Howl’s Moving Castle,’ ‘Kiki’s Delivery Service,’ and the Oscar-winning ‘Spirited Away,’ among others. With ‘The Boy and the Heron’, which also won an Oscar, Miyazaki delves into a more personal narrative and brings the realm together in a way that one would lose sense of what is real and what is imaginary. What is more interesting is how that also becomes meta, in the sense that Miyazaki merges his reality with the imagination in the film. Set against the backdrop of World War II, the film revolves around Mahito (Soma Santoki), who tragically loses his mother in a hospital fire caused by war. A few years later, he and his father, Soichi Maki (Takuya Kimura), relocate from Tokyo to the countryside. There, Mahito meets his mother's sister, Natsuko (Yashiko Kimura), who his father is set to marry. She is also pregnant with his child. While Natsuko's resemblance to his late mother is striking, Mahito struggles to come to terms with his grief. As he navigates these changes, he also observes his father's growing closeness to Natsuko. All this while, dreams of his mother being engulfed by the flame keep haunting him back. However, he does not get the space to share it. It results in Mahito hurting himself on his way back from the first day at his new school. Watch the trailer of 'The Boy and the Heron' here: Amidst the shift that his life is undergoing, he keeps seeing a grey Heron (Masaki Suda). He promises to take him to his mother. While he does understand that it is a cruel joke, he still takes the plunge. After he and one of the old caretakers, Kiriko (Kou Shibasaki) venture into the forbidden castle in an attempt to find Natsuko, who goes missing, they are transported to a different realm. There, not only does he meet Himi (Aimyon), who has the power of flame, but also a fierce younger version of Kiriko who helps him out. It is a different realm, one that proves to be the safe space that he longed for, where he can speak his heart and fight for what he feels is right. It is here that he not just accepts Natsuko as his mother, but also confronts the fact that he hurt himself, a reminder that his feelings are not as black and white as his great granduncle (Shohei Hino) would want the successor of his world to have. The storyline here is complex and requires you to have focus, something that we generally do not expect the Instagram reel generation to be able to do (myself included). There were people in the theatre who would quip, ‘what’s happening’ in the middle of the film, because if you lose focus, you might be lost just like Mahito in the magic realm. However, if you surrender to Miyazaki’s vision of the film, it would be a rewarding journey. The film is also not fast-paced. Miyazaki takes his time to build his characters and his world, and isn’t rushing into it. And that is why, long after you have left the theatre, the film will linger on. The more you think, the more layers will be added, making it an experience that will stay beyond the 124 minutes. What is also amazing is that the film takes you back to the time when a film would compel you to not take it at its face value and think, something that has majorly been missing in most Indian releases in recent times. The film also seems to be reminiscent of Miyazaki's previous films, and other Ghibli films. For example, the opening sequence is reminiscent of 'The Grave of the Fireflies', while old maids of the household would remind you of 'Spirited Away'. It is also interesting to note the character of the great-granduncle. Is it a tribute to Isao Takahata, or is it the matured Miyazaki placed against himself as a boy? Hayao Miyazaki’s pauses and background music are also measured. Most of the film is devoid of background music and relies on what sounds that the movement would make. The piano music blends smoothly, and you will feel your heartbeat rise with every crescendo. The film requires your patience. If you wish to go for something whose story is linear and simple, this one wouldn’t be for you. But, if you have watched the Ghibli films, especially Hayao Miyazaki’s previous works, and have fallen in love with them, there is simply no reason at all to miss this one."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A massive iceberg roughly four times the size of New Delhi has broken away from the Brunt Ice Shelf in Antarctica. The break off event was captured in satellite imagery on May 20. The calving event, resulting in the 380 square kilometer iceberg designated A-83, marks the third significant ice loss from this region in just four years. The separation occurred due to a prolonged weakening of the ice at the McDonald Ice Rumples and the eastward extension of a large crack known as the \"Halloween Crack.\" In 2021, the same area produced iceberg A-74, followed by the even larger A-81 in 2023. Radar images from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite show the triangular A-83 iceberg clearly detached on May 22. Thermal data from Landsat 8 helps characterize the iceberg's thickness, with warmer areas indicating thinner ice closer to open water temperatures. A83 iceberg captured in radar images. (Photo: ESA) \"The temperature differences between water and ice help identify precisely where the calving line is,\" explained glaciologist Jane Smith of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). While calving is a natural process, the increased frequency raises concerns about the impacts of climate change on Antarctic ice shelves. Routine satellite monitoring provides unprecedented views into these remote events and how ice shelves respond to changing conditions. The calving event does not pose any immediate threat to BAS's Halley VI Research Station, which was relocated in 2017 due to instability in the outer ice shelf. However, it underscores the dynamic nature of Antarctica's ice and the importance of continued observations. \"The Copernicus Sentinel-1 radar allows year-round viewing, which is crucial through the dark austral winter months,\" said European Space Agency scientist Alex Johnson, adding \"This event highlights the value of satellite data for monitoring Antarctic ice shelf changes.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A new report has revealed that the world experienced an average of 26 additional days of extreme heat over the past 12 months, a phenomenon that would likely not have occurred without the influence of human-caused climate change. The report comes as parts of India reels under extreme heatwave that is expected to last over a week. The report, published by the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, the World Weather Attribution scientific network, and the nonprofit research organization Climate Central, highlights the alarming role of global warming in increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events worldwide. To conduct the study, scientists first established a baseline by determining the temperatures that fell within the top 10 percent for each country between 1991 and 2020. They then analysed the period from May 15, 2023, to May 15, 2024, identifying the number of days that experienced temperatures exceeding this baseline range. Using peer-reviewed methods, the researchers examined the influence of climate change on each of these excessively hot days . Their findings were striking: \"Human-caused climate change added – on average, across all places in the world – 26 more days of extreme heat than there would have been without it.\" Prayagraj: People cover themselves for protection against the heat wave on a hot summer day, in Prayagraj, Saturday, April 27, 2024. (PTI Photo) The report's release comes on the heels of 2023 being declared the hottest year on record by the European Union's climate monitor, Copernicus. Already in 2024, extreme heatwaves have afflicted vast regions across the globe, from Mexico to Pakistan. According to the report, approximately 6.3 billion people – roughly 80 percent of the global population – experienced at least 31 days of extreme heat over the past 12 months. In total, 76 extreme heatwaves were registered in 90 different countries on every continent except Antarctica. Some of the most affected nations were in Latin America, with Suriname experiencing an estimated 182 extreme heat days instead of 24 without climate change, Ecuador 180 instead of 10, Guyana 174 instead of 33, El Salvador 163 instead of 15, and Panama 149 instead of 12. \" (Extreme heat) is known to have killed tens of thousands of people over the last 12 months, but the real number is likely in the hundreds of thousands or even millions,\" the Red Cross stated, emphasizing the deadly impact of these extreme temperatures. As Jagan Chapagain, secretary-general of the International Federation of the Red Cross, aptly put it, \"Flooding and hurricanes may capture the headlines, but the impacts of extreme heat are equally deadly.\" This report serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for global action to mitigate and adapt to the escalating effects of climate change."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story After reporting a rising number of Covid-19 cases consistently for the past few days, Karnataka recently registered a sudden dip. Despite falling victim to the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic much later than states in North and West India, Karnataka quickly became one of the worst affected. From merely 58 cases on March 6, the daily Covid tally in Karnataka climbed to 49,058 by May 6, surpassing Maharashtra. After May 6, the daily cases have started dropping. On Wednesday, the state health department reported 34,281 fresh cases of coronavirus. Does this mean that the lockdown imposed by the Karnataka government was effective and the state has passed the peak of the pandemic's second wave? Or, is the state government not testing enough people to keep the data low? According to the state's recent health bulletin, Karnataka is currently testing only 1 lakh people a day. Earlier, this figure stood at 1.75 lakh. Meanwhile, the state's positivity rate continues to remain high, ranging between 26.46 per cent to 32.50 per cent, last week. Mounting heat on the BS Yediyurappa government, former chief minister Siddaramaiah has accused it of falsely projecting a dip in Covid cases. \"The Karnataka government is testing less. In comparison to last week, the government is now testing significantly less. It is obvious that they are trying to falsely project a dip in numbers. I have written many letters to the chief minister but I have got no reply,\" Siddaramaiah said. However, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has claimed that the testing numbers dipped because of hesitancy among people. BBMP Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that people in Bengaluru are hesitant to get tested. Additionally, the companies have stopped testing their employees due to the lockdown, he said. \"We are encouraging people to test more. But lately, we see people are hesitating to get tested. Earlier, companies used to get their employees tested, but now, due to the lockdown, they aren't testing much,\" Gaurav Gupta said. Karnataka has close to 6 lakh active cases of Covid-19."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story As people in Karnataka struggle to find a bed amid the raging Covid-19 pandemic, Karnataka Health Minister K Sudhakar has reserved 15 per cent beds at three Covid-dedicated hospitals in Bengaluru for people of his constituency, Chickballapura. Via a written order to the authorities, K Sudhakar has reserved nearly 100 beds at Aster CMI Hospital, Baptist Hospital and Colombia Asia Hospital in Bengaluru. Patients who contact the civic authority, BBMP, are being told all hospitals are full and they need to wait even if the majority of the 100 reserved beds are vacant. \"I called the BBMP several times asking for a bed for my brother, whose oxygen levels had dipped to 80. The BBMP said we need to wait as there are no beds. They said many old people whose oxygen levels had dropped to 60 were still waiting for a bed. I have made more than 100 calls to the BBMP but it's been 10 days. They still haven't alloted a bed,\" a Banegaluru resident told India Today TV. A pot check to these hospitals revealed that the reserved beds were lying vacant, in accordance with the health minister's order. On Thursday, a ruckus broke out at Astor CMI Hospital as people demanded answers from the hospital authorities on why vacant beds were not given to desperate patients. Enraged Congress MLA Krishna Byre Gowda, in whose constituency these hospitals are located, slammed the health minister for showing little concern to the larger population while prioritising people of his home constituency. \"He forgot about the people who are dying. He tried to use his power as the health minister to issue a notification from his department to reserve beds. Then, all districts near Bengaluru should get the same preferential treatment. Tumkur, Mysuru, Kolar must also get quotas. Why only Chikkaballapur? This is ridiculous. The health minister can't build forts around few available facilities and hijack them. Every deserving person must get a bed,\" Krishna Byre Gowda said. However, the health minister is unperturbed by people's rage. The minister has justified his action by saying that his constituents are entitled to reserved beds as his constituency does not have sufficient medical infrastructure. \"The Chikkaballapur district doesn't have any medical college. Tertiary treatment isn't available. Just because I am also the health minister should the people of Chikkaballapur suffer? One hospital is reserved in Bangalore. Just 100 beds. Are they not entitled to it?\" K Sudhakar said. Other ministers in the Karnataka government have distanced themselves from the matter. The Opposition has written to the chief minister. \"Sudhakar is the health minister for the entire state, not only for Chikkaballapur. It's not wrong to help the people of Chikkaballapur, but how can he ignore the others in need?\" Leader of Opposition Sidaramaiah asked. Karnataka is among the worst-affected states by the Covid-19 pandemic. The state currently has roughly 6 lakh active cases and the positivity rate is oscillating between 27 and 32 per cent.

Cases of children losing their parents to Covid-19 are also mounting by the day. In Karnataka's Mandya district, a 10-day-old baby girl lost her parents to the virus. Yet to be named, the child was born to Mamta and Nanjundegowda after nine years of anxious wait and prayers. Unfortunately, just five days before the delivery, the baby’s father succumbed to Covid-19. The mother passed away, five days after delivering the girl. READ | Covid-19 second wave and children: What are the symptoms, what should parents do The baby girl, too, caught Covid-19 but quickly coped up and is now stable. She is currently at the Mandya district hospital. Dr Keerti of the Mandya district hospital said, \"The question now arises, who is going to adopt this child?\" However, the District Child Protection Officer (DCPO) of Mandya said the adoption process is not easy, and it shouldn’t be either. Elaborating on the process of adoption, Basavaraj, Mandya DCPO, said, \"The child welfare committee will settle the child at a special adoption agency for two months. If no one comes forward, only then will the child be legally free for adoption. The adoption process is online. Due diligence will be done on the family who’s applied and eligible. If all specifics match, the matter then goes to the district court for approval.\" ALSO READ | Why are more children testing positive for Covid-19 in India's second wave? Mamta's brother and his wife have come forward to adopt the baby child. They have two children of their own and are eager to welcome the newborn into their home. The child's aunt said it is relieving to know that the baby has managed to find care and love even before realising what she lost."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story While the second wave of Covid-19 has been unsparing in most parts of India, some pockets have managed to escape the wrath of the virus. The Isha Foundation ashram in Tamil Nadu's Coimbatore, with thousands of volunteers, has managed to combat the spread of the disease along with 43 villages in the vicinity. But how did they do this? As the western region of Tamil Nadu experiences a surge in Covid-19 cases, the Isha ashram located in Coimbatore with over 3,000 volunteers has managed to safeguard its inhabitants. The residents believe this is due to their self-imposed strict lockdown protocols. Speaking to India Today TV, Ma Jayitri, the administrative coordinator at the Isha Yoga Centre said, \"For the past one year, we’ve been very careful with following the protocols. We stopped all guests from entering the premises. All outdoor activities were also curtailed.\" \"We have reorganised the ashram...if you’re not wearing a mask, then you have to hold a board and stand for two hours as punishment,\" she added. Apart from this, preventive measures like regular temperature checks, sanitisation and social distancing are mandatorily followed within the ashram even as the inmates continue to practice their daily duties like conducting yoga sessions, cooking, gardening, farming, content writing, graphic design and composing music. The ashram has also devised strategies to keep the volunteers fit and healthy during these times. Volunteers regularly practice a three-minute yogic practice called 'Simha Kriya' which is said to strengthen lung capacity and the immune system. Volunteers also claim their clean eating habits have helped them in keeping the virus at bay. \"The food that we have here is Satvik food...mostly raw vegetables and fruits two times a day,\" said Dr Suman, the medical coordinator at the Isha Yoga Ashram. Speaking about the daily routine of Ashram volunteers, Ma Jayitri told India Today TV, \"We start our day at 4.30 am with neem leaves and a ball of turmeric with a glass of warm water. Apart from this, we drink an Ayurvedic drink called ' Nilvembu Kashayam' twice a day on an empty stomach.\" The ashram volunteers have also imparted some of their wisdom to 43 villages in the vicinity. The surrounding areas have reported a relatively low case count, despite Coimbatore city limits witnessing an unprecedented surge in cases. Panchayat head Sadanandam Booluvampatty said, \"There are hardly any cases in the 13 hamlets here. Nobody goes out, only a few people leave to go get essentials and come back.\" Ashram volunteers feed the famous Kashayam, which is a mix of 15 herbs, to nearly one lakh people in the surrounding 43 villages, while also teaching them some yogic practices and creating awareness on Covid protocols. \"We serve 90,000 people on daily basis. We convey the importance of Covid protocols in unique ways. We use loudspeakers to impart the message and speak to them in their local language,\" says Swami Nakuja, a volunteer at the Isha ashram. \"Every day at 11 am they [Isha volunteers] serve us Kashayam. It’s kept us in good health. It’s helped us fight common cough and cold,\" a local told India Today TV. Strict adherence to a simple lifestyle has managed to shield Isha ashram and surrounding villages from the onslaught of Covid-19."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story As Basavaraj Bommai takes oath as the new chief minister of Karnataka, discussions are thick over the new cabinet formation. Keeping in mind the upcoming elections, the BJP is likely to go for a generational shift, pushing senior leaders on the edge. Hence, the senior lot, and also the turncoats, who enjoyed cabinet berths in BS Yediyurappa’s administration , are anxious about their political future. As per sources, former chief minister Jagadish Shettar and senior leader KS Eshwarappa looked rather irked throughout the Legislative Party meet and oath-taking ceremony of Basavaraj Bommai . He is perceived to be BS Yediyurappa’s man, making it unpleasant for many dissenters who wanted Yediyurappa out. Meanwhile, among the 17 turncoats, 11 of whom were awarded cabinet births, are unsure about their situation now. Sensing the growing demand to recognise loyal party workers during the cabinet formation, sources say, many of these defectors will be dropped. Only a few will be inducted based on performance and caste factors. ALSO READ: Karnataka gets new chief minister: Who is Yediyurappa’s successor Basavaraj Bommai? Some like K Sudhakar, BC Patil, Byrathi Basavaraja, HT Someshekar, Shivram Hebbar were spotted with Basavaraj Bommai since he was announced as the Legislative Party leader. They accompanied him to the Raj Bhavan for the oath-taking ceremony and subsequent meetings as well. Despite that, the road ahead for them will be far from smooth. Aspirants are many but there are only 34 berths in the state cabinet. Going by the recent exercise in the Union Cabinet, it appears that the BJP in Karnataka too wants to infuse young and fresh faces for a more energised head start for the 2023 assembly polls. The flood situation in northern Karnataka, coupled with the pandemic at hand, has presented a mammoth task to Basavaraj Bommai. Thus, the cabinet must come into effect soon. The freshly minted chief minister arrived in Delhi on Thursday to exchange pleasantries with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. According to sources, he is also set to discuss the cabinet formation with them. An announcement is likely to emerge sooner ALSO READ: Karnataka needs it too: BJP leader CT Ravi on population control policy WATCH: Basavaraj Bommai is Karnataka's new chief minister"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Former Afghan minister Masoud Andarabi has said there was no \"specific threat\" to the life of ousted president Ashraf Ghani on the day he fled the country as the Taliban approached Kabul. In an exclusive interview with India Today TV, Masoud Andarabi said Ashraf Ghani wrongly claimed a threat to his life in a recent interview , adding that even the president's Chief of Staff was not aware of his plan to leave the country on August 15 . \"The day the president (Ashraf Ghani) fled Afghanistan, there was no Taliban in the palace. What he said in his interview was utterly wrong. The decision (of him leaving) was not made by his security cabinet. His Chief of Staff was not aware of his plan to leave,\" Masoud Andarabi said. \"There was no specific, individual threat to the president. At 10 am (on August 15), he had a meeting with the NDS (National Directorate of Security) and Chief of Staff, there was no talk about any threat,\" he added. Masoud Andarabi, who was removed by the Ashraf Ghani government in March 2021 amid much criticism, said the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan was a classic miscalculation of the Afghan government, especially the national security advisors. \"The way the government's political structure failed, it left ANDSF (Afghan National Defense and Security Forces) no shelter. The chain of command and the president himself screwed up,\" Masoud Andarabi said. <!--/*--><![CDATA[/* ><!--*/ <!--/*--><![CDATA[/* ><!--*/ iframe.taliban_iframe { width: 100%; height: 800px; }@media (max-width:767px){ iframe.taliban_iframe { height: 810px; } }@media (max-width:479px){ iframe.taliban_iframe { height: 570px; } } @media (max-width:340px){ iframe.taliban_iframe { height: 480px; } } /*--><!]]]]><![CDATA[>*/ /*--><!]]>*/ \"The Ghani government was very much engaged in the tactical level in the last few years which was a mistake,\" he added. Read: Bad temper and a 'puppet': The rise and fall of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani Masoud Andarabi said in the long term, the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan will have implications on the international community. \"The Taliban grow on fear and radical Islamists and they have very close ties with international terror outfits such as Al-Qaeda. That's how they managed to get to power today -- the suicide attack, the brutality,\" he said. Exclusive | Taliban don't treat women humanly, their govt shouldn't be recognised: Afghan pop star \"Do you think they would stop that? If they do, they will lose their ground. I think they will continue their relationship with terrorism and will continue to remain a threat to the world,\" Masoud Andarabi added. Asked about Pakistan's role in the return of Taliban rule in Afghanistan, Masoud Andarabi said Pakistan's relationship with the militant group is \"undeniable\". \"The Taliban has enjoyed safe havens and terror training camps in Pakistan for years. I think Pakistan will be the number one to bear consequences for themselves,\" Masoud Andarabi said.

Masoud Andarabi also said the Chinese were also engaging with the Taliban to protect themselves from the Uighur rebellion. On the resistance in Panjshir , Masoud Andarabi said, \"I think there will be backs and pushes and resistance. It shows that if the Taliban do not adjust to today's Afghanistan, these pocket resistances will keep popping up. The resistance will continue in any form across the country.\" Masoud Andarabi said if the Taliban want people to support them, they should look to form an elected government and not an emirate. Otherwise, there will be armed resistance against them, he said. Masoud Andarabi said the US pullout from Afghanistan was \"inevitable\". \"It's very unfortunate for the Afghan govt and every other country engaged in Afghanistan. After 20 years of engagement and several elections, we are seeing this situation today. Everybody had a role to play in this and we failed together,\" he said. \"We still have a chance to remain engaged in Afghanistan and to be able to make something out of the current situation so that we don't end up with a dark future,\" he added.

Mohammad Zahir Aghbar had recently requested Interpol to detain Ashraf Ghani. Speaking to India Today TV, Mohammad Zahir Aghbar said the sequence of events that took place in Afghanistan last week, including Ashraf Ghani's fleeing, was pre-planned. \"We can't blame everything on the international community. The poor leadership in Afghanistan, actions of Ashraf Ghani, their actions in the Afghan army, turning everything into a private organisation,\" Mohammad Zahir Aghbar said. \"The only law Ashraf Ghani abided by was keeping the Afghan flag raised. Aside from that, every law in the constitution was broken by him,\" he said. Mohammad Zahir Aghbar said the actions of Ashraf Ghani had destroyed the peace process. Also Read | Afghan woman gives birth to baby girl aboard US evacuation plane Mohammad Zahir Aghbar said there was no logic in believing that the Afghanistan Army, which was trained by the US and Nato forces for the last 20 years, lost the battle to a group that was neither heavily equipped nor well trained. Mohammad Zahir Aghbar said in the absence of Ashraf Ghani, Amruallah Saleh was the acting president of Afghanistan. \"In accordance to the Afghan constitution, the first vice-president takes over as the acting president in case the current president flees the country without resigning from his position. What we did was completely legal,\" he said. The Tajikistan embassy had taken down photos of Ashraf Ghani after he fled the country on August 15 and replaced them with those of Amruallah Saleh. Acknowledging that Taliban had greater control over Afghanistan today, Mohammad Zahir Aghbar said the international community had not legitimised them yet. Mohammad Zahir Aghbar said the Taliban cannot run a government in Afghanistan by not including every tribe in the government. \"I hope that the Taliban understands that Afghanistan is not the same as it was 20 years,\" he said.

On Ahmad Massoud, the leader of Afghanistan's last major outpost of anti-Taliban resistance in Panjshir, Mohammad Zahir Aghbar said, \"Ahmad Massoud, just like his father, believes in inclusive peace. The people in Panjshir are not there to attack anyone but to defend their honour if attacked by anyone.\" \"I hope that Panjshir is announced as a secured zone and that the negotiations take place from now,\" he said. Massoud, son of Ahmad Shah Massoud, one of the main leaders of Afghanistan's anti-Soviet resistance in the 1980s Mohammad Zahir Aghbar said India was a great friend of Afghanistan and the two countries had seen great partnerships between them throughout history. He pointed out that if drug trafficking, violation of human rights, and harbouring of terrorists continued in Afghanistan, it would be a problem for the region and the international community. Speaking on Pakistan's alleged support to the Taliban, Mohammad Zahir Aghbar said, \"There are millions of Afghans living in Pakistan now and they will not forget the love and support they received there. They also won't forget that they trained people in suicide vests to kill people in Afghanistan\" \"I hope people in Pakistan put pressure on those in the country who are trying to impact this friendship in a negative way,\" he added.

A delegation of advocates, students, women's rights activists from Bahutva Karnataka, PUCL-K, Dalit Minority Sene, All India Students Association, IISC students and others met the director of the PU board, stating that several PUC colleges are turning away Muslim girl students, in violation of the court’s interim order. “We explained how the interim order applies only to colleges where CDC has prescribed a dress code and not to colleges which don't have one or where hijab was being previously worn,” a signatory told India Today. However, Muslim students and staff are facing public humiliation in the wake of the court order, they claimed.

An iconoclast who strung out her inner life in an autobiography shockingly frank on matters of sexuality—so frank that it was censured as a “striptease”—ensconced behind the Muslim veil? It was the unlikeliest of controversies to have ruffled India’s public life. She passed on in 2009, a mystery wrapped in an enigma, literally. But an unlucky 13 years later, the hijab has been yanked back to centrestage, borne along on a set of seismic events with very many more layers—and vastly higher detonative power. Events that played on the soil of inner and outer lives."

Major cities continue to be pounded and shelled, most of them now resembling ghost towns with just smoke and fire left around. Lakhs of people have fled Ukraine as explosions and gunfire continue to rock major cities, including Ukraine’s capital Kyiv. Heavy explosions are being heard as close as 20 km from Kyiv’s city centre. Thousands are thought to be dead or injured. Those left behind have stayed to fight for their country, most parts of which are now left in ruins. READ | India abstains in UN Human Rights Council vote on Russia-Ukraine crisis Despite the intense pushback, the Ukranian cities of Borodyanka and Donetsk were completely bombed out. Videos have emerged showing charred buildings, fire burning on the streets, destroyed Russian military vehicles and civilians trying to find their way out of this horror. This aerial view of Borodyanka, a town 40 miles away from the capital Kyiv, shows how Russian troops have attacked civilian infrastructure. What remain are scorched residential buildings, debris scattered all around, burnt down trucks and smoke coming out of buildings along the main streets. One of the residential buildings has been torn apart as fire still smolders inside. Some brave civilians tried to stop the movement of Russian troops and tanks by putting up sand bags and hedge hogs. A chilling video from the city of Chernihiv shows the aftermath of Russian strikes as an apartment building was bombarded, leaving atleast 33 people dead and 18 wounded. The images from the separatist region of Donetsk were as disturbing. Residential areas and public spaces were all reduced to rubble. Some women and children left behind were seen taking shelter in bunkers while Russian troops were seen on the streets of Donetsk. Russian fighter jets have also destroyed a combined heat and power station in Okthtyrka during an aerial bombardment. Russia claims to have so far destroyed 1,612 Ukrainian military infrastructure units. As Russian forces inch closer to the capital city of Kyiv, this invasion by land, air and sea is seen as the biggest attack on a European state since World War 2.

Madhavan said, “I think they should send Rocketry also, The Kashmir Files.” Further adding, “He [Darshan] is starting a campaign for The Kashmir Files, I am starting a campaign for Rocketry.” Madhavan then said, “No, all the best to them. I hope they go and win and make us proud. It’s time that we do as well in the film industry as we do as a country.” R Madhavan, while promoting Dhokha Round D Corner , spoke to IndiaToday.in about Oscars equivalent in India. He said, “I also hope we have an Oscar equivalent or better in India. Ab bohot ho gaya we are trying to prove something over there.” To this, Aparshakti Khurana added, “We need a legit award show. One of them has come up and it’s called Critics Choice-something award.” About the craze around Oscars, R Madhavan said, “It’ll be good to have the mantle, it will be a different thing. The only difference with Oscar is that anybody who gets it in the West, there’s a huge difference in their stature, income, salary, in the way they proceed in the industry. We should have one in India where the moment we get the award, there’s a legitimate increase in the valuation to go up.” ALSO READ | R Madhavan, Aparshakti Khurana's Dhokha Round D Corner to release on September 23"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Congress workers in Karnataka are celebrating the coronation of veteran party leader from the state, Mallikarjun Kharge, who took charge as the Congress president on Wednesday. The Karnataka Congress unit was jubiliant and believe that Kharge's elevation to party's top post will prove to be a shot in the arm for the Congress ahead of the 2023 state election. With roughly six months left for the Karnataka Assembly polls, Kharge's thorough understanding of the state politics is expected to shape the Congress's poll strategy ahead of time. Also known as \"sole illada sardara\" (a leader who has never lost), Kharge has been Congress's strongest Dalit face in Karnataka. He has been elected nine times as MLA from Kalaburagi. Kharge was also reportedly very close to becoming the chief minister of Karnataka thrice in 1999, 2004 and 2013, but narrowly missed the opportunity. However, with no complaints and any signs of revolt, he remained a staunch loyalist of the grand old party. These factors make Kharge a well-respected leader within the Karnataka Congress unit. Interestingly, it is being speculated that all warring factions of the Congress in Karnataka may unite in the name of Kharge. Well, the Congress high command indeed expects Kharge to revive the party, something which they were unable to since last few years. Sonia Gandhi would hope that the veteran leader might act as a binding factor in the Karnataka Congress unit, which has been divided in two factions led by DK Shivkumar and Siddaramaiah. Speaking about Kharge taking over reins of the Congress, Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar said it has given the state unit new strength and energy. \"Kharge becoming congress president has given the state unit new strength and energy. All of us are very happy. We are he will guide the party to new heights,\" Shivakumar said. However, the move could backfire too. Currently, there are two power centers in Karnataka Congress unit and with Kharge as new Congress chief, the paradigm shift could very well give rise to a third power center in the state. Beating down speculations, the Karnataka Congress is positive that Kharge's new role will only add to the party's moral ahead of Karnataka Assembly polls. The party also expect that decision making in the state will get easier and better. The newly-appointed Congress president is also expected to play a pivotal role in consolidating Dalit votes for the party. It is also being said that one of the reasons to pitch Kharge as presidential candidate was the upcoming elections in his home state. Now, only time will determine whether the \"Kharge effect\" will prove to be a game-changer for Congress in crucial Karnataka polls."

The model and actress addressed an array of questions about her life, ranging from her insecurities, her relationship with Arjun Kapoor and co-parenting, at the event during a session titled ‘Bursting Bubbles: On love, sex, ageism and topping the body-beautiful conversation for 25 years’. When asked if she attributed her fame to the surname she had while she was married to Arbaaz Khan, Malaika said that having a famous surname did open many doors for her but she still had to work hard and prove herself every single day. FULL COVERAGE OF CONCLAVE 2023 “It did have a lot of benefits in my life. But I don’t think I could rest on the fact that I had a famous surname. Yes, it did open up a lot of doors for me, but at the end of the day, I had to work irrespective of what my married surname was. I had to work hard and prove myself every single day to stay in the game. The day I did have that surname and I went back to my maiden surname, I still continued to work and continued to make a difference,” Malaika said. The actress also revealed that many people warned her against dropping the surname. “I had a lot of people tell me that I am making the biggest mistake of dropping the surname. Everybody said that ‘you don’t realise the weightage a surname has’. I have a lot of respect for my ex in-laws and my ex-family. They have given me a lot of love,” Malaika said. Going back to my maiden surname has given me a sense of self: Malaika Arora #IndiaTodayConclave2023 #IndiaTodayConclave #Conclave23 #MalaikaArora | @nabilajamal_ pic.twitter.com/vtb69Y7Fz6 — IndiaToday (@IndiaToday) March 18, 2023 “Just being able to drop that surname and go back to my maiden name, it gave me a sense of self. That’s what made me feel I could do anything or take on anything in life,\" Malaika said. Malaika also opened up about her relationship with Arjun Kapoor and their marriage plans. “If we have to take that plunge, we will think about it and we will decide and we will talk about it. In this moment, we are just loving life. We are enjoying our pre-honeymoon phase,” Malaika said. She also reacted to the criticism that she constantly receives for dating a younger man.“When I got divorced, I was told that the tag will always be there. To find love after getting divorced was another thing. And then finding love in a younger man, I was clearly told I have lost my marbles. I would just like to say that love doesn't have an age,” she said. “If you fall in love, you fall in love. Irrespective of whether he is a younger man or older man, it should not define the space we are in. I am grateful that I found a partner who understands me. The fact that he is younger keeps me younger. I just feel on top of the world,” she added."

Asked about the challenges that she might be facing while co-parenting and being a single mother, Malaika said, “I think co-parenting is very tough. Not always, two people are on the same page about a lot of things. Especially when you go your separate ways, there's always something that doesn't quite fit into the picture. So, co-parenting is always tough.” Moreover, Malaika added, “I think, thankfully, both Arbaaz and me are better humans today. I think we are better people today. And, I am really proud of the fact that we can co-exist and be able to give our child all the love and attention that he needs and deserves. We are there for him every step of the way. Irrespective of the fact that his parents are not together, we are together as a unit when we need to be together and that's what matters.” Watch Malaika Arora’s full session at the India Today Conclave 2023 here: Malaika Arora is the star of blockbuster dance songs Chaiyya Chaiyya (Dil Se), Maahi Ve (Kaante) and Munni Badnaam Hui (Dabangg)."

Despite encountering unpredictable ocean currents, weather, and climate conditions, she pushed through to reach that elusive end point. “Thank god I am alive. I could barely feed. 19 hours and 31 minutes of nonstop swimming is tough for the body to endure. My mind and body are totally exhausted. Nature is wild and the weather is unpredictable. I experienced strong currents and opposite winds from 9 pm to 4.30 am. It was a humbling experience to come out alive. My body is still recovering,” said Burman.

A government should also be honest. But what is the BJP government in Karnataka doing? The government, from the beginning itself, wasn’t formed with your trust.

They are corrupt and they will never fulfil your promises,\" she said. \"Around Rs 1.5 lakh crore has been looted from Karnataka. Can you imagine what all could have been done with this money for your state? If the BJP's intentions were right, then the Karnataka government could have built AIIMS, ESI hospitals, 30,000 smart classes, 750km of Metro routes, 2,250km of highways and 30 lakh houses for the poor.

Several contractors died by suicide. The contractors' association wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and still there was no solution. You might have read about how Rs 6 crore was recovered from an MLA's son....,\" said Priyank Gandhi.

The BJP conspired to finish off Nandini. They have reduced the production of milk so that you feel it’s less and that way, they can bring Amul to Karnataka. During Congress's rule, there was surplus production of milk, as a result of which we started providing milk to school children,\" she said. Claiming that reducing the production of milk was a ploy by the BJP to discredit the brand value of Nandini in people's eyes, Priyanka Gandhi said that the Congress would strengthen the home-grown brand and would not let any other cooperative make its way into the markets in Karnataka.

The govt has stolen people's money.\" \"Billionaire friends of PM Modi are making so much money...but one has to pay GST for the smallest of things. Why are you paying Rs 1,200 for a gas cylinder? School fees, essential commodities, everything is getting expensive day by day. The BJP is not doing anything for you,\" said the Congress leader. \"They don't want to lift you from poverty.

Women work in secrecy to earn extra money so that their kids get good education. If the Congress comes to power, women in every household will be given Rs 2,000 per month,\" she said. \"You all know Indira Gandhi. Her speciality was that she never broke your trust.

The jobs lying vacant in government departments will be filled. Up to 200 units of electricity will be free. Unemployed graduates will be given Rs 3,000 financial assistance,\" she said. \"You don’t have to go by what I am saying. But just think, has your life become better after this government came to power? Has inflation gone up or decreased? Don't go by what I say but vote on the basis of the experience you have had during the rule of the BJP,\" she said. Karnataka goes to the polls on May 10 and the results will be out on May 13."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Karnataka MP Pratap Simha appeared to take a dig at Mysuru royal Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja - who replaced him as the Lok Sabha candiate from Mysuru-Kodagu constituency - saying he was happy that the ‘Maharaja’ would now work as a regular representative of the people, including responding to \"requests for help to clear garbage and debris\". Pratap Simha was at the centre of controversy last year for issuing authorisation passes to intruders who breached the Lok Sabha chambers from the visitor's gallery on December 13, the anniversary of the Parliament attack. Simha, aged 47, was omitted from the BJP's second candidate list announced on Wednesday. \"We have party protocols. We sit on the floor when our seniors are around. We wait in the sun to welcome our leaders with bouquets. The Maharaja is ready to do it, we are happy. Similarly, we go pick our leaders from airports, tour them across events and drop them back to airport. If Maharaj is happy doing all this, we are happy,\" Simha said. He further said, \"The Maharaja will give palace grounds to the common people. What more do we want? We are so happy. People of Mysuru-Kodagu used to call me asking for help with petty issues. Imagine now the Maharaja is willing to help them. We are so happy. People call me to help clear garbage and debris. I'm happy the Maharaja will do it now.\" Before the announcement of Chamaraja's name for the Mysuru-Kodagu seat, Simha had praised the royal scion, saying, \"One has to welcome this. Being one amongst the citizens to work for fellow citizens, is truly a welcome and praiseworthy move. When we achieved independence in 1947, all class differences between a king and commoners ceased to exist. Let's welcome Yaduveer for choosing to be amongst the citizens as a citizen.\" However, after BJP released the list, Simha said he \"called and congratulated Maharaja Yaduveer\" and \"will start campaigning in the next two days\"."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Delhi recorded the hottest day of the year and its recorded history on Wednesday as temperature crossed the 50-degree Celsius mark. Mungeshpur in Delhi recorded 52.3 degrees Celsius. Health authorities are sounding the alarm about the severe risks extreme heat can pose to human health and well-being. From triggering life-threatening conditions like heatstroke to exacerbating chronic illnesses, the impacts of intense heat should not be underestimated. Heat waves and extreme heat events pose significant health risks, exacerbating existing medical conditions and leading to acute health crises. The body's ability to regulate its internal temperature is challenged by a combination of environmental factors, including high temperatures, humidity, low wind, and high thermal radiation, the World Health organisation said in its latest assessment. These conditions can impede the elimination of heat generated by metabolic processes, creating a dangerous scenario for heat storage within the body. When the body cannot effectively dissipate heat, the risk of heat exhaustion and heatstroke rises sharply. Heat exhaustion can progress to heatstroke, a severe condition characterized by the failure of the body's temperature regulation mechanisms, leading to potential damage to the brain and other vital organs. The severity of heat-related health impacts depends on the timing, intensity, and duration. (Photo: AFP) Additionally, the cardiovascular and renal systems are under increased strain as the body struggles to cool itself, potentially exacerbating chronic conditions like heart disease, respiratory issues, and diabetes. Heat stress can also cause acute kidney injury due to dehydration and the increased workload on the kidneys. The immediate effects of extreme heat are seen in the rapid onset of heat-related illnesses, resulting in increased deaths and hospitalizations on the same day or shortly after heat events. This necessitates swift interventions when heat alerts are issued to mitigate health risks effectively. Beyond direct health impacts, extreme heat can disrupt essential services. Power outages and transportation failures during heatwaves can compromise healthcare delivery and emergency responses. The ability to work and study is also hampered, reducing productivity and potentially leading to closures of workplaces and educational institutions. Furthermore, heatwaves are often linked with poor air quality and pollution, compounding health hazards. The severity of heat-related health impacts depends on the timing, intensity, and duration of heat events, as well as the population's acclimatization and adaptability to heat. As global temperatures rise, understanding and addressing the health implications of heat become increasingly crucial for public health planning and response. WHO in its latest guidelines said that to keep yourself safe from the rapid heatwave, open windows after dark when the outdoor temperature is lower than inside. During the day, close windows and use blinds or shutters to block sunlight. Turn off electrical devices to reduce heat. Use fans only when it's below 40°C, as they can increase body heat above this temperature. If using air conditioning, set it to 27°C and use a fan to feel 4°C cooler, potentially saving 70% on cooling costs. Stay cool and hydrated by wearing light clothing, taking cool showers, and drinking 2-3 liters of water daily. Check on vulnerable individuals regularly."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape on Wednesday blamed \"extraordinary rainfall\" and changes to weather patterns for multiple disasters in the Pacific Island nation this year, including a landslide last week which may have killed thousands. Parts of a mountain in the Maip-Mulitaka area in Enga province in PNG's north collapsed in the early hours of Friday and Marape said more than 2,000 people are estimated to have died, with up to 70,000 people living in the area impacted by the disaster. \"Our people in that village went to sleep for the last time, not knowing they would breathe their last breath as they were sleeping peacefully. Nature threw a disastrous landslip , submerged or covered the village,\" Marape told parliament on Wednesday. Natural disasters have cost the country more than 500 million kina ($126 million) this year, before the landslide at Enga, he said. \"This year, we had extraordinary rainfall that has caused flooding in river areas, sea level rise in coastal areas and landslips in a few areas ,\" Marape said. \"We have faced extraordinary weather patterns and changes from dryness to wetness,\" he added. Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso said: \"The climate change effects that are here now is not just in Enga, for the last two months we have seen unprecedented disasters throughout the country.\" Defence Minister Billy Joseph arrived in Enga on Wednesday with relief supplies including food, water, blankets and tents provided by Australia on two Australian military aircraft. villagers search through a landslide in Yambali village, in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea. (Photo: AP) Australia's High Commissioner John Feakes said in Enga more plane loads, with supplies and Australian rescue personnel and technical teams would arrive in coming days, the PNG Post-Courier reported. The United States has pledged 2 million kina ($506,800.00) for emergency shelter and logistics support, its embassy said. Authorities have raised concerns about the outbreak of diseases amid warnings of further landslides . Thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate. Rescue teams have been slow to reach the site because of the treacherous terrain and tribal unrest in the remote area, forcing the military to escort convoys of relief teams. The arrival of heavy machinery from the PNG Defence Force has been delayed by damage to a bridge along the route. The U.N. said repairs should be finished by Thursday, when 5-10 machines hired locally will also arrive on site. T he landslide has also cut off access to the Porgera gold mine, operated by Barrick Gold (ABX.TO), opens new tab through Barrick Niugini Ltd, its joint venture with China's Zijin Mining (601899.SS), opens new tab. The miner said its operations were not affected. Marape said the government was working with Barrick to reopen the road. Barrick said it had offered the government more heavy equipment at the slip site. The U.N. migration agency has warned of an outbreak of infectious diseases if immediate steps are not taken. \"Every passing minute, bodies buried under the debris are decaying, with water squeezed between the ground and the vast debris covering an area of three to four football fields is continuing to leak, this is posing a high health risk,\" Serhan Aktoprak, the head of the agency's PNG mission said in an emailed statement."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said India needs to be prepared domestically by focusing on manufacturing to counter China. Speaking on Day 2 of the India Today Conclave 2024, Jaishankar said, \"We need to recognise that we have a very challenging, strategic neighbour. It's not just about the boundary issue. There are major economic issues as well.\" \"If you need to deal with China you need to have an economy which is geared up for it,\" he added. Jaishankar noted that while the relationship with China deteriorated after the 2020 Galwan clashes, the tensions were building up over a period of time. \"Because we weren't honest about it to ourselves, we weren't articulating it and strategising it according to it,\" the minister said. \"There was a time when we actually said we are China's strategic partner. If I were to say this today people would be baffled,\" he added. Jaishankar said that it was only in the last decade that India started focusing on its manufacturing sector to take on China. \"In only the last decade we have paid attention to manufacturing. We started our economic reforms 30 years ago but we didn't focus on manufacturing much,\" he said. Speaking about the military-level talks with China, Jaishankar said there are issues related to border patrolling because both the forces are forward deployed. \"We, as a reactive posture, have brought a very large number of troops with weaponry up close (to the border). Clearly, it is something where we have to be very patient but also very persevering,\" he said. Speaking about the Russia-Ukraine war, Jaishankar said, \"We have, since the conflict in Ukraine started, been involved in a number of issues. We haven't been very public and explicit about all of them. In many cases, one or the other party or a third party or an international organisation has asked us to weigh in in some form. And if we believe that doing so was helpful, because ideally at this time, the world wants this conflict to end. But, unfortunately, it's not something that anybody is expecting in the near term.\" When asked about reports that Prime Minister Narendra Modi helped avert a nuclear attack on Ukraine by Russia, Jaishankar said, \"We have been continuously doing whatever we can to reduce tensions, to relieve worries, to see that things don't happen which make it worse.\" Speaking about the increasing attacks on merchant ships in the Gulf of Aden by Houthi rebels, Jaishankar said India being a responsible country has amongst the largest maritime presence in the region to deter such attacks. \"In the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden deployment, I think (we have) about 12 ships there. So if you look in terms of national commitment, we would be among the larger national presence,\" he said. When asked how foreign policy is affected in the times of social media, Jaishankar said, \"I am paid to fix foreign policy, not social media. I mean, to be honest, nobody can fix social media. The nature of the platform is such that everything which you somewhat disapprovingly state is actually something which gets more eyeballs in social media.\" Jaishankar also spoke about how the Centre deals with the changing governments in friendly countries, referring to the upcoming US elections. He said that since India is not a part of any alliance system globally, \"we don't have all the consequential issues that come out of it\". \"We had a very difficult time in our relationship with the US in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. So what happened was because our challenges were more with the administration, we actually concentrated on the Congress as a way of engaging the American polity,\" he said. \"Over a period of time, we developed this very bipartisan way of working, of casting our net wide,\" the Minister added. On the issue of anti-India elements raising their voice in the US and Canada, Jaishankar said, \"You keep using the US and Canada seamlessly. I would draw a line there for a variety of reasons. Most notably, all said and done, American politics has not given that kind of space to violent, extremist views and activities that Canada has done. So, I don't think it is fair to the US to lump them together. I would distinguish between the two.\" S Jaishankar said after the US shared information regarding the alleged plot to murder Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, India decided to set up a \"high-powered committee\" to look into it as there seemed to be an \"organised crime aspect\" to the case."

Speaking at the India Today Conclave 2024, Omar Abdullah, along with senior Congress leader and former Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot and Delhi Education minister Aitishi discussed the strategy of the Opposition INDIA alliance for the upcoming polls. \"One mistake that we make from time to time that we need to address is the whole thing that we are seen as anti-Modi. Every time we launch a personal attack on PM Modi, it boomerangs on us. It does not work and I am telling you this from experience,\" Abdullah said. Full coverage of Conclave 2024 \" Chowkidaar chor hai , Adani-Ambani doesn't work and let's accept it. For whatever reason, the man (PM Modi) seems to be coated in Teflon. Nothing that you say stays, like it or not, it's a fact,\" he added. However, the Jammu and Kashmir politician also said that the BJP has got richer. \"You cannot make the case that the Prime Minister has money, because there is no evidence to prove it. But there is every evidence to support the fact that while a large part of India has got poorer, BJP has become richer. 50 per cent electoral bonds when to them (BJP),\" Ombar Abdullah said. Meanwhile, Sachin Pilot said that the INDIA alliance is contesting the Lok Sabha elections to win and whether it will win or not is for the public to decide and its best that the judgement remains on hold till June 4 when the poll results will be announced, senior Congress leader and former Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot said on Saturday. \"INDIA alliance as a partnership came to the front because of the circumstances that this country has witnessed for the last nine years. Unfortunately, there has been a systematic and constant attack on the well-established constitutional entities of the country. The idea behind forming INDIA alliance was to get all the opposition parties together to give a formidable challenge to the NDA and defeat them in the polls,\" Sachin Pilot said. \"BJP, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, got a 37 per cent vote share. This means two-thirds of the electorate voted against the BJP. So, the slogans 300 par, 400 par, 500 par do not matter. What matters is two-thirds of India did not vote for the BJP, he added. When asked about Aam Aadmi Party's decision to come into an alliance with Congress, whom the party has opposed since its formation, Delhi minister Atishi said that the country is facing a larger danger at the moment and that is the reason why the INDIA alliance was formed. \"I may have differences with one of the parties in the INDIA alliance, but we all want to protect the constitution of the country. On WhatsApp, there are enough number of people who would tell you that if the BJP comes to power at Centre again, there will be no elections in Delhi. If they come into power, there will not be any other political party in the country. The fact that such messages are already circulating on social media is the indication of directions that the ruling party is thinking of,\" the AAP leader said."

He said that the country has the highest number of drug-resistant infections. \"AMR is the third leading cause of death in the world,\" said the founder and director of One Health Trust at India Today Conclave 2024. Talking about antimicrobial resistance (AMR), Laxminarayan said, \"This is not a problem for the future. It is there right now. Antibiotics are hugely misused across South Asia. We have the combination of cheaper antibiotics, there's rising income so we can afford it, and they're easily available without a prescription.\" He also pointed out a lack of awareness in the country about antibiotics. 'There's a lack of awareness in the country about antibiotics': Ramanan Laxminarayan, Epidemiologist, Founder & Director, One Health Trust at India Today Conclave (Photo: Hardik Chhabra) \"Most people wouldn't know their drug is an antibiotic because it doesn't say it on the label. Most people don't know that antibiotics only work in bacteria and not viruses. As a result, the bacteria have become resistant to the antibiotic, which means they no longer respond to it,\" the expert added. Talking about mitigating the crisis of AMR, Laximarayan said that the rising trajectory can be stunted unless we can prevent the disease through better vaccination strategies, ensure better hygiene, stop consuming antibiotics without prescriptions and ensure sanitation in hospitals. Ramanan Laxminarayan, Epidemiologist, Founder & Director, One Health Trust at India Today Conclave (Photo: Hardik Chhabra) Speaking about Disease X, an unknown upcoming pandemic, Laxminarayan said that it could be any viral, bacterial or even fungal infection. \"Now we have bird flu. For H5N1, we are concerned about it because now it is transmitting effectively from mammal to mammal. It's killing off lots of exotic wild species. It could infect humans as well but it hasn't been transmitted from human to human. On any given day, some disease is trying to jump from animals to humans because that's where the evolutionary lottery is,\" he said. The expert shared that while Covid-19 has a fatality rate of 2 out of 1,000 cases, bird flu has 600 out of 1,000 cases. \"The potential exists because this disease is trying to make its way to humans. It is decimating wildlife populations,\" he stressed. Ramanan Laxminarayan, Epidemiologist, Founder & Director, One Health Trust at India Today Conclave (Photo: Hardik Chhabra) He talked about the role of climate change in the next pandemic. \"Zoonotic diseases are typically the ones that occur when a disease spreads from animal to humans. Climate change is making species come in contact to species that would've never been in contact with each other,\" said Laxminarayan. Climate change is melting the permafrost, which could give rise to the spread of pathogens that have been frozen for millions of years. \"In today's time, the speed of travel is high, making it hard to contain anything. Pandemics would spread slowly. But today, that process will take only a few hours,\" he said. Ramanan Laxminarayan, Epidemiologist, Founder & Director, One Health Trust at India Today Conclave (Photo: Hardik Chhabra) He spoke about how India can prepare itself for Disease X. \"We can have better vaccination coverage which India has improved. We should have better water facilities and sanitation. There needs to be infection prevention programs in hospitals,\" said Laxminarayan. He added that Disease X will emerge from outside the country unless it is a fungal pathogen. \"For fungal infection, we stil lack vaccines and drugs to treat it. Fungal pathogens are more deadly with climate change, \" he said. For the major preparation, \"there should be cooperation among countries.\" He said, \"When the disease is identified comes, everyone should know about it. We should cooperate with other countries to make sure that a vaccine is quickly available for everyone.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story World Economic Forum President Borge Brende said India is on a path to achieve strong growth for the next 25 years and that he is “very bullish” about the future of the country’s economy. His statement came during the India Today Conclave 2024 in New Delhi. “On India, we are very bullish. This is not just this year and next year. We foresee that India will be growing for the next 25 years, provided that the reforms continue,” Brende said, highlighting that the country’s growth also supports the rest of the world. “Many would be surprised to learn that 15 per cent of all global growth last year came from India,” he added. Full coverage of Conclave 2024 Brende expects India to meet its goal of becoming a $10 trillion economy in the next decade, adding that the country is slated to become the world’s third-largest economy “very soon”. He said that 50 per cent of the global growth comes from emerging economies and will continue for the next decade. Brende added that from 2040, emerging economies will be accounting for 60 per cent of global growth, with India leading from the front. “So, this is like a snowball. A snowball is small at the beginning, but when it starts to roll, it gets bigger and then it rolls faster. And that is India today,” Brende said. He attributed India’s growth to multiple factors, including geopolitics, youth surplus and global supply chain changes. “There is a change in the global value chains, so a lot of companies are establishing themselves, producing and manufacturing in India. Secondly, you have so much of a youth surplus, you have one of the youngest populations in the world,” he said. He also highlighted India’s strong growth to fiscal prudence, highlighting that it is “extremely important”. On what more can be done to drive India’s growth, he said there should be more efforts towards getting rid of red tape, more investments towards infrastructure development and spending more towards education. The WEF President also highlighted manufacturing as another key area where India needs to focus on. He said, “To be a real hub for manufacturing, you see that in China, 30 per cent of all global manufacturing is happening there. We are seeing more companies establishing themselves in India too, but I think you also have to look at the tariffs.” “All this is gradually happening and that’s why we are seeing the growth,” he added."

Speaking at a session titled 'Why the West gets India’s democracy wrong', Tripurdaman Singh asserted that Indian democracy is unique, developed to address specific questions. “Indian democracy is normatively unique. The normative comparison to the West, where you say the degree of difference somehow represents a spectrum of inferiority, in my mind, is a very strange and unproductive comparison to make,” Singh said.

It is either backsliding from a normative ideal which is generally taken by the advanced democracies in Western Europe and North America,\" he added. Tripurdaman Singh further said, \"India has never been like the advanced democracies of Western Europe and North America. Its foundation addresses a very specific set of circumstances and addresses a very specific set of questions.\" Commenting on the alleged bias in India’s representation in the West, Tripurdaman Singh said it reflects their ignorance towards India and the scale of achievements the country has made. \"It is reflective of ignorance. There is a sense of orientalist stereotyping that fuses a lot of commentary and writing on India. It doesn't necessarily come as bias, but it is outright ignorance, and it is quite common,” he added. Asked about whether the Uniform Civil Code and Citizenship Amendment Act reflect the rising majoritarianism in the country, Tripurdaman Singh said the state is armed with the power to intervene in social relations. “We have a socially revolutionary Constitution. It hands to the state vast powers to intervene in the social domain to regulate and legalise social relationships. That was precisely because Ambedkar and Nehru thought that Indian society lacked the capacity for reform from within,” he said. According to him, when one section of society can bring do social reform and another section doesn't, it is important for the state to intervene. “It is not majoritarian,” he said. However, Tripurdaman Singh noted that electoral polity is majoritarian by design as we run the government through the first-pass-the-post principle."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story ‘Will AI take away my job?’ That’s a question that has been asked time and again, and rightly so. AI experts like the Nvidia CEO predicted that AI could replace coders . Former HCL CEO predicted that AI could lead to IT companies in India needing 70 per cent fewer people . However, speaking at the India Today Conclave 2024, Vyshak Venugopalan, Director Solution Consulting at Adobe India, and Samik Roy, Executive Director, India & South Asia at Microsoft India, showed a brighter picture of AI’s impact on jobs. “AI will lower the floor so more people can enter. It will democratise creativity to a large extent. At the same time, it will also elevate the ceiling, so that we will all be driven –– with the help of enablement and education –– and the professionals will be elevated to uplift the quality of work”, says Venugopalan. “And that is what has happened in any other transformational wave of technology, which has come to us. It has always amplified and progressed the human race, in the longer run”, he adds. The Adobe India executive also suggests that it is crucial to explore and apply AI now to advance careers and lives. “It is important to dip your toes in right now and understand how this can be applied to your own life to progress individual careers and life. It is important to understand it and embrace it so that it enables you to fast forward into the future,” he suggests. Samik Roy from Microsoft India agrees. He also suggests that reskilling is an important part of the job in the AI era. “The fear [of losing jobs to AI] is valid,” says Roy, “but it is about the elasticity of the job market... it needs skilling and reskilling”. “The good part of AI is that it reduces the learning curve a lot,” he adds. Microsoft has its own gen AI tool called Copilot. The company has also invested billions of dollars in OpenAI –– the company behind ChatGPT, Dall-E and now Sora. Tech leaders like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and X chief Elon Musk are often heard talking about AGI or Artificial General Intelligence. There is also a lot of skepticism around this future of AI, mostly because of predictions that AGI would exceed human intelligence. Earlier this week, Musk shared his prediction that AI will surpass human intelligence by 2029 . Is that something to fear? “We will create intelligence that will far exceed human intelligence, and AI will become smarter than all of us”, says Roy. “But it is important to understand that these are all tools and technologies for humans to use. How you use the tools depends on us...They [AI] are not going to overtake us,” he adds. But he also stresses the need to train and use “AI ethically and within the guardrails”. The conversation of using AI ethically and responsibly is often talked about. However, a more important conversation right now is how AI is trained. What is AI being fed? This is especially pertinent at a time when AI tools like Gemini were found to have harmful bias . It is also an election year for India and deepfake videos are becoming more common . ““There are real threats of deepfake...It is important to acknowledge them”, says Venugopalan of Adobe India. Adobe has its own popular generative AI tool called Firefly. “It is absolutely important to see through what you are feeding the AI,” he says. “We put an immense amount of effort, due diligence through our ethics committee to ensure that what goes into our Firefly model is safe for use, and all the assets we have trained our AI on, we have a license for it,” says Venugopalan. “To make sure that whatever comes out of our image generation models are safe to use, we haven’t fed any celebrity into it, so you will never see a celebrity out of it, we haven’t fed anything not safe for work,” he adds."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Egyptian-American comedian Bassem Youssef, a vocal supporter of Palestine, pulled no punches as he flayed Israel for its war in Gaza as civilian casualties continue to mount in the war-torn strip. Labelling Israel a “typical narcissist”, Bassem Youssef demonstrated at the India Today Conclave 2024 how satire can be used to take apart the Benjamin Netanyahu government’s “propaganda” to justify its military actions in Gaza. Addressing the session 'Viral from Israel-Gaza War Zone: A Stinging Comic Commentary' , Youssef, 49, began on a light note. \"I now live in America which, in its spare time, invades people here and there...\" Full coverage of Conclave 2024 He quickly dived into how state-sponsored propaganda is creating an \"alternative reality\" leading people to \"be okay with\" what's happening in Gaza and to the Palestinian people. \"You cannot refute propaganda with facts and truth. Propaganda is meant to make you emotional, have a visceral reaction. The lies have to be so elaborate as to prevent you from using common sense. They distract you, ignore reality, and make you focus on what they want you to focus on,\" he said. Here's why Egyptian comedian @Byoussef said, \"I now live in America which in spare time invades people here and there...\" #IndiaTodayConclave24 #BassemYoussef @ShivAroor pic.twitter.com/7UJLIhnc0M — IndiaToday (@IndiaToday) March 16, 2024 Referring to his viral appearance on the Piers Morgan show, Youssef said he was forced to defend \"people who were vilified even as they were being slaughtered\" because Israeli propaganda, through lies and emotional blackmail, made millions of people believe that they deserved to die. To counter this, satire comes in handy, he said. To drive his point home, Youssef performed a brief skit: \"How many people should we kill? All of them. But Israel is warning civilians before bombing them. Very, very cute!\" He alleged that the Netanyahu government used a number of oft-repeated clichés -- from the October 7 attacks by Hamas, to dead babies and raped women, and even Syria -- to divert the conversation on the crisis in Gaza. All he did was regurgitate their talking points back at them to show them \"how stupid they are\". The comedian called satire the \"kryptonite\" of propaganda. \"When you laugh at someone, you are not scared of them any more. When you ridicule their lies, they have no leg to stand on. And when you use common sense, laced with a little bit of humour, their talking points self-implode,\" said Youssef. \"Satire is a huge threat to propaganda\"- Egyptian comedian @Byoussef #IndiaTodayConclave24 #BassemYoussef @ShivAroor pic.twitter.com/3WTt9QwlLr — IndiaToday (@IndiaToday) March 16, 2024 Bassem Youssef is an Egyptian-American comedian, television host, and even a surgeon. He is best known for hosting Al Bernameg, a satirical news show that tackled Egyptian politics with humor. This was the first show of its kind in the region, and it became hugely popular, garnering millions of viewers weekly. Youssef's sharp wit and ability to use humour to critique political issues earned him the nickname \"The Jon Stewart of the Arab World.\" Time Magazine included him on their prestigious Time 100 list. While Youssef started his career as a cardiothoracic surgeon, his comedic talent eventually took center stage. However, he still holds qualifications like being a member of the Royal College of Surgeons."

The Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister also gave a cryptic message regarding Congress veteran Kamal Nath's entry to the BJP, saying one who is standing at the juncture of the door, might also come inside some day. He implied that Kamal Nath might switch sides to the BJP soon. Full coverage of the India Today Conclave 2024 Praising the BJP for being a party for everyone as against the Congress's \"dynasty politics\", the Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister also shed light on his equation with his predecessor Shivraj Singh Chouhan. When asked if there was any form of pressure on him after Chouhan's chief ministerial seat was snatched from him and given to Mohan Yadav, the latter quashed any such talks. \"The seat was not snatched, it was given to me by Shivraj Singh Chouhan,\" Mohan Yadav asserted. He said that he shares an amiable relationship with Shivraj Chouhan. \"I go to him to meet him...a few days back, I was in a rally with Shivraj Chouhan after he was named as a Lok Sabha candidate. Then, a few days ago, we participated in a groundbreaking ceremony at a school in Bundhni together,\" Mohan Yadav said at the India Today Conclave 2024. The Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister also shared inside details from December 11, 2023, the day the BJP shocked everyone by choosing him for the position. \"I was chatting with my MP friends at the event, and we were discussing who might be picked....When my name was announced, I couldn't believe my ears,\" he said. Mohan Yadav also renewed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's '400-paar' pitch in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections."

Speaking during a session titled ‘The Orry Mystique: The Rulebook for Becoming Viral, Influential and Stylish’ at the India Today Conclave 2024 in New Delhi on March 16, Orry was asked about the next celebrity he wished to get photographed with. Is it Taylor Swift, Orry was asked. “I want a picture with the PM,” Orry said, with a big smile. Orry, who exclaimed without batting an eyelid that he wants to be the “life of every party”, also spoke about the pictures that he clicked with Rihanna at Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s pre-wedding festivities in Jamnagar earlier this month. “Jamnagar was the most unreal place in the world. It was very well thought of. Vantara was absolutely amazing. I like to be at every single party. I don’t want to be at a pity party. I want to be at the coolest party,” Orry said. Speaking about his viral pictures with Rihanna from the Jamnagar gala, Orry said, “I love Rihanna. For the longest time, I did not know who she was. My marketing trick, that I shouldn’t be revealing this early is ‘OOO’ or ‘OOI’ – Objects of Orry/ Objects of Interest. I will make a little museum one day.” A post shared by Orhan Awatramani (@orry) “In my outfit, there will always be a talking point. I knew Rihanna was coming. I knew Rihanna would be looking, and I had to have a beautiful object of interest on my head. I wore these giant dandelion earrings, knowing she would see them. And, she did. She said, ‘I would like the earring please.’ And I told my friend, take out your phone. This is the moment I wore this earring for. Took out the phone. Gave her the earring. Seven minutes later, she has lost the earrings, and has come back for the other one, and I pinned it on her top.” Orry, who has over 1 million followers on Instagram, is truly the “life of every party”. Celebrities including Janhvi Kapoor, Nysa Devgan and Ananya Panday are some of his close friends, and he often goes viral for the pictures that he posts on Instagram with almost every star. Earlier this year, Orry also made his debut on Karan Johar’s chat show ‘Koffee With Karan’ and made headlines for the phrases that only Orry could coin: “Relevance Room” and “Digital Demise” ."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story At the India Today Conclave 2024, celebrated Danish architect Bjarke Bundgaard Ingels, founder of the Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), shared his groundbreaking collaboration with NASA on Project Olympus, aiming to establish the first permanent human settlement on the Moon. This ambitious project, which uses solar-powered lasers to melt moon dust, marks a significant leap towards humanity's extraterrestrial habitation, promising the construction of the Moon's first architectural marvels. Ingels, known for his innovative approach to sustainable architecture and design, emphasised the transformative potential of architecture in shaping human experiences, drawing an intriguing parallel between LEGO blocks and architectural practice. \"LEGO is not just a toy; it's a tool that empowers children to create their own worlds,\" Ingels remarked. This philosophy underpins his vision for lunar architecture, where creativity and sustainability merge to form habitable spaces beyond Earth. Project Olympus is a pioneering effort in utilising in-situ resource utilisation (ISRU) techniques, with ICON, a Texas-based company, developing technology to build using materials found on the lunar surface. FOLLOW INDIA TODAY CONCLAVE UPDATES HERE This initiative not only paves the way for sustainable extraterrestrial construction but also aligns with Nasa's broader goals for long-term lunar exploration and habitation as part of the Artemis program. Throughout his career, Ingels has been instrumental in creating structures that challenge conventional architectural norms, such as Copenhagen's waste-to-energy plant, which doubles as a ski slope, and the design for Prague's National Philharmonic. His company is also responsible for 'The Mindfulness City', which was crafted in Bhutan's Gelephu, in harmony with the vision of King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck to establish a new economic hub in the country. Encompassing over 1000 square kilometers, \"this masterplan seamlessly weaves together Bhutanese cultural essence, the principles of Gross National Happiness (GNH), and the spiritual legacy of the country,\" Ingels said at the India Today Conclave 2024. Bjarke Bundgaard Ingels, founder of Bjarke Ingels Group shows future human settlements on the Moon. (Photo: India Today) These projects exemplify his commitment to \"hedonistic sustainability,\" where environmental considerations are seamlessly integrated into designs that enhance human enjoyment and interaction. As humanity stands on the brink of extending its reach to the Moon and beyond, Ingels' collaboration with Nasa on Project Olympus offers a glimpse into a future where living on other planets could become a reality. This venture not only showcases the potential for innovative architectural solutions in harsh environments but also reinforces the importance of designing spaces that foster community and well-being. With the Artemis missions underway and plans for lunar homes by 2040, the dream of a sustained human presence on the Moon is closer than ever."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Spiritual leader Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, speaking at India Today Conclave 2024, welcomed the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), but added that it was \"coming too late\". A vocal proponent of the controversial piece of legislation when it was introduced four years ago, Sadhguru panned the delay in enacting CAA, describing it as \"too little compassion coming too late\". “When we left people on the other side of the border post Partition, there was hope that they will be well taken care of. There was also a promise in the political space that if there are problems, we will take [you] back. But over 75 years, they have faced the worst of the worst. Many of them moved here 30-40 years ago but are still refugees in this country. Are we not ashamed?\" the Isha Foundation founder said. Full coverage of Conclave 2024 Asked for his opinion on criticism of the CAA on the grounds that it is discriminatory against certain religions, Sadhguru pointed out that by law, there was no religious discrimination in India, whereas discriminating against minorities is sanctioned by law in a few neighbouring countries. While acknowledging that India was \"not a perfect society\" where many forms of discrimination are still practised, Sadhguru said, \"When there are countries that are theocratic, theocracy means, by law, discrimination... There are blasphemy laws, if you say a word you can be hanged.\" He further stated that there should be no cut-off date in granting citizenship to refugees. \"It is too little compassion coming too late when people have suffered for decades.\" The Centre on March 11 notified rules for the Citizenship Amendment Act, four years after it was cleared by Parliament. The law aims to provide citizenship to undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan who came to India before December 31, 2014. Sadhguru categorically stated that there was no polarisation in India, insisting that the notion that the atmosphere in the country was \"vitiated\" was a wrong one. With the Lok Sabha election dates set to be announced today, Sadhguru had a timely reminder to offer: \"There must be time for elections, and there must be time for administration.\" The spiritual leaders claimed that political figures tend to say \"irresponsible things\" in the run-up to polls, and when elections are conducted throughout the five-year term, these kinds of utterances become the \"narrative of the nation\". He therefore called for ' One Nation One Election \", dubbing it an important step towards \"Ram Rajya\". In a pointed aside, Sadhguru said the cycle of constant elections had led to the creation of political parties \"who need employment on a daily basis\". He said elections should be held \"once every eight years until India becomes a $12 trillion economy\". \"If any policy is brought in or change is made, for it to go down to the last man in the rural space, it will take at least six to eight years. Before that happens, another election [takes place], another person will come and replace the whole thing. This is not the way to run the nation if you're interested in the people... Politics is for people, people are not scapegoats for politics,\" he said."

He also said he had the opportunity of meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other dignitaries and received a warm welcome in the country. \"Bhutan, and we have come a long way. This journey has been successful because of the friendship, goodwill, and unconditional support of the government and the people of India,\" PM Tshering Tobgay, said, adding, \"We are deeply grateful for your generosity and support.\" The Gross National Happiness is a measure of the economic and moral progress of the country of Bhutan. The concept was introduced in the 1970s, as an alternative to gross domestic product. It includes an index which is used to measure the collective happiness and well-being of a population."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan on Saturday said that the rise of China and the country's \"friendship\" with Pakistan were among the biggest challenges that the Indian Armed Forces were facing today. Speaking at the India Today Conclave 2024, General Anil Chauhan said that both the neighbours profess a friendship \"as high as the Himalayas and as deep as the oceans\" and they were both nuclear capable. However, Anil Chauhan noted that these challenges were \"predictable\" and known to India. He said that the unpredictability lies in the way warfare was changing. General Chauhan said that going ahead, there would be tactical, logistical and even organisational changes. \"Hence, keeping these in mind, choosing the path to ensure that India is on the right path is what poses the real challenge,\" he said. Full coverage at India Today Conclave 2024 Reiterating that the rise of China was India's biggest challenge, the Chief of Defence Staff said that the neighbour's expansion, however, has not been smooth. He said it would be \"slightly difficult\" for China to achieve its geopolitical aims. When asked if India's geographical position offers a solution to the challenges, Anil Chauhan said, \"For us, the Himalayas have been providing security for ages...But of late, because of advancement of technology, the Himalayas are no longer an impediment... But then we also have the geographical advantage because of the peninsular shape, flanked by two island territories... and access to the Indian Ocean is very, very restricted, and we enjoy a pre-dominant position... We need to balance out continental challenges and maritime challenges.\" He said that India being a land centric country, and having two neighbours that do not have cordial ties with us - China and Pakistan - \"opportunities lie in the sea\". Anil Chauhan also dismissed the idea of not taking Pakistan's military seriously, given the country is grappling with a major financial crisis and only recently found some political stability. He said that Pakistan's military retains their capability with \"no dent\", and as a result, remains a threat to India. The Chief of Defence Staff said that the primary goal at the moment for the Indian armed forces is to integrate the capabilities of the three services so that there is oneness. Anil Chauhan said that the three services need to be integrated on a cyber, space and cognitive level so that the oneness serves as a bedrock for a foundation the forces can work in a united environment. He said this integration is the armed forces' immediate goal by 2027. He, however, said that for the armed forces, it's not possible to prepare set goals till 2047, but asserted that a process is on to articulate a vision. Anil Chauhan was also asked to address the criticism of the Centre's Agniveer scheme. He said that when feedback was taken from commanding officers, and other soldiers who are in the field, who need agniveers in their units, they were happy with the latter. \"The agniveers have no problem. The people who are going to work with these agniveers, who will be a part of their team to fight a war or a combat situation or operationally get deployed, they have no problem or any issues. The larger issue is from outside actually,\" he added. The Chief of Defence Staff pointed out that times have changed and in the current, transformative era we live in, one needs to think of ways to strengthen the country and the Agniveer scheme is aimed at that vision. Anil Chauhan said that every war is defined by the politico military objectives set along with technology and geography. Therefore, the Chief of Defence Staff said that if in the Ukraine war, the lesson learnt is that if the objective is to retain the territory, the war is going to prolong for long. Speaking on the Israel-Hamas conflict, Anil Chauhan said that the lesson learnt was that hi-tech surveillance and systems are not always a solution to keep enemies at bay as far as the borders are concerned. When asked if the work of the Indian armed forces get hampered because of the absence of a national security strategy in India despite it being over seven decades of independence, Anil Chauhan said that the policies and structures of the same are in place. \"Had we not done that, we couldn't have reacted to the Covid situation in a calibrated kind of manner,\" he added, giving the examples of Balakot strikes and the abrogation of Article 370 as well. Anil Chauhan also cited Israel, saying that the country's last national security strategy was formulated in 1956 at the time of Ben Gurien - first Israeli Prime Minister. Even then, he added, the country has survived without that. On the contrary, he said, Pakistan, which released a National Security Policy in 2022, went into a massive monetary crisis soon. Therefore, the Chief of Defence Staff said that having a written document in place does not always help. He asserted that the policies and structures of the Indian armed forces are prominently laid out and in place, but the absence of a written document doesn't hamper the functioning of the forces."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Union Home Minister Amit Shah, speaking at India Today Conclave 2024 on Friday, described the BJP's alliance strategy as \"more about chemistry than physics\". The Home Minister was speaking about the BJP's alliance talks with various regional parties ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. While the BJP has announced an alliance with the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Jana Sena Party in Andhra Pradesh, there is still uncertainty over a possible alliance with the ruling Biju Janata Dal in Odisha . \"Politics is not about physics but chemistry. One plus one is not always two, sometimes it could be eleven,\" Amit Shah said. When asked if winnability is the only factor for alliances, Amit Shah said, \"We are in hardcore politics. There is no philosophy involved here. It involves the arithmetics of win and loss and the party's ideology.\" \"You need to create a synergy between the parties' ideologies and the winnability factor. Only then is an alliance formed,\" he added. Amit Shah was asked why the BJP chose Telugu Desam Party and Jana Sena Party in Andhra Pradesh over Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSRCP which has often supported the central government in Parliament. On this, the Home Minister said, \"These are two different issues. Voting takes place in Rajya Sabha based on issues, not party tie-ups. They (YSRCP) have also opposed on many other issues. Each party votes on the basis of its ideology and interests.\" On the possible alliance with Biju Janata Dal in Odisha, Amit Shah said, \"I can't speak about this right now as the party leadership, including BJP president JP Nadda and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have not decided how will we go ahead in Odisha. But whatever is the result, I can assure you that we will see a massive growth in both the assembly and Lok Sabha in Odisha.\" When asked about Haryana, where BJP and its ally Jannayak Janta Party parted ways recently, Amit Shah said, \"We don't have any bad relations with the Jannayak Janta Party. They had some specific demands regarding the number of seats (for Lok Sabha elections) which led to some difference of opinion. But we parted ways on a good term and that too before elections.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The India Today Conclave 2024 is currently underway in New Delhi. On Day 1, Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff graced the stage and talked about their upcoming film, ‘Bade Miyan Chote Miyan’ . The duo addressed the session titled ‘Bade Miyan vs Chote Miyan: Double Dose of an Action Ride’ . It was here that Tiger Shroff called Akshay Kumar the ‘original action hero’ and ‘our very own Tom Cruise’. Akshay Kumar: It was a no-brainer. When I got the script, the first thing written was ‘action and comedy’. Both are such genres that I love. I felt like saying yes even without reading the script, but I read the script and it was even more fun. It is a complete popcorn-binging film. It’s a lot of fun because, after a long time, I am getting to do action and that too with a lovely co-star like Tiger Shroff. Tiger Shroff: The most special thing was to work with the original action hero, our very own Tom Cruise, Mr Akshay Kumar. I have grown up idolising him and now actually sharing the screen with him, I am very grateful. I have learnt a lot from him and there’s a lot to learn from him. I got to see him up close and personal, got to spend a lot of time with him on and off the screen. I used to think I wake up early. I generally wake up at 6 or 6:30 am but sir wakes up at 4:30 am. I used to get wake up calls from him and we used to do our exercise together before the shoot. Throughout the film, we tried to do our stunts. Minimal VFX has been used and the locations are also real. We have shot in Abu Dhabi, Jordan, Scotland, Glasgow and the UK. In this film, I have tried to raise the bar and in real life, he (Tiger Shroff) has raised the roof. I got to learn a lot from him and he is very professional. I have seen him doing warm-up, stretching before doing every stunt. He has a long way to go. Akshay Kumar: We have been watching films since childhood and we have been trained to think that if there is ever a terrorist attack, then America will come to the rescue because we have seen it that way in Hollywood films. If ever there is any sort of attack, America is the solution. I want to change that. If something happens, India will come to the rescue. That’s what I want to do and I also would request the government to glorify our soldiers. Tiger Shroff: Thanks to our amazing Prime Minister and leader, he has gotten us on the map. Special thanks to him. It is fair to say that India is a superpower and is amongst the top two, three (countries of the world). So I am an Indian who is proud of representing our country and proud of this film where sir (Akshay Kumar) and I try and glorify our nation in whatever way we can."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Young sensation Anahat Singh has started off her career on a stupendous note and has given a glimpse of what’s to come. At the tender age of 16, the squash prodigy has taken giant strides and has set her goals clear for the Los Angeles Olympics 2028. Singh was on cloud 9 after it was announced back in October 2023 that Squash would be a part of the LA Olympics. The youngster said that when the next edition of the mega event takes place, she would be in a much better space, both “mentally” and “physically”. Juggling between school and squash, Anahat has struck the right balance between her studies and her passion for the game. \"I think my reaction would have been like any other athlete. This is the first time that Squash will be in the Olympics. It was announced the day after the Asian Games and we were all together. It was the highest medal tally that India has got for squash,” Anahat said at the India Today Conclave on Friday, March 15. “The timing when it was announced was perfect. And the fact that I am going to be at my peak physically and mentally at that time is a really big advantage. Really grateful and hopefully will get a medal as well,\" she added. Back in 2022, Anahat made history after she became the youngest Indian participant in the Commonwealth Games at the age of 14. In Birmingham, she made her country proud after beating Jada Ross of the Saint Vincent and Grenadines in the Round of 64 match. Although she lost 7-11, 7-11, 11-4, 6-11 to Emily Whitlock from the Wales, she did not go down without a fight. Last year, Anahat upped her game and won 2 medals in the Asian Games that took place in Hangzhou. She finished on the podium in the team doubles and mixed doubles along with the likes of Joshna Chinappa and Dipika Pallikal. Back in November 2023, Anahat became the second-youngest to win the National Squash Championship. She edged past Tanvi Khanna, who retired midway with the scoreline at 9-11, 11-4. Anahat has shown great promise, and it goes without saying that the squash star has a bright future in the offing."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Elon Musk-led Neuralink, which focuses on addressing motor problems and brain issues, neuroscientists are looking towards a future where dreams can be transmitted, marking the next frontier in neuroscience. Moran Cerf, Professor of Neuroscience and Business was at the India Today Conclave 2024 . Cerf is known for helping individuals and businesses harness current knowledge about the brain to improve thinking, leadership, personal development, decision-making, and customer engagement. This ambitious vision is not without its challenges and ethical considerations. The prospect of brain implants raises concerns about the end of the human race as we know it and the potential for hacking thoughts. The future of neuroscience in enhancing business strategies and the potential of brain implants to revolutionise human capabilities were brought into focus at the Conclave 2024. Cerf's insights shed light on an emerging trend where businesses are increasingly turning to neuroscience, not just for understanding brain functions but for leveraging this knowledge to make more informed decisions, enhance customer engagement, and drive innovation. Silicon Valley, known for its relentless pursuit of breakthrough technologies, is at the forefront of exploring how a deeper understanding of clients' desires and behaviors can lead to more addictive products and services. According to Cerf, the intersection of neuroscience and business is about \"turning our understanding of thinking into business, understanding emotion,\" which is becoming a critical tool for companies aiming to stay ahead in the competitive market. Moran Cerf, Professor of Neuroscience and Business at Columbia University at the India Today Conclave. (Photo: India Today) However, Cerf's work extends beyond the application of neuroscience in business. He delves into the realm of brain implants , a technology that promises to transcend the natural limitations of the human brain. \"The brain is the same brain for many millennia, and there are limitations to what it can do,\" Cerf explains. By integrating a digital component that interfaces with the brain internally and connects to the cloud externally, the possibility emerges to significantly enhance human cognitive abilities and access the vast power of the internet directly through thought. Cerf, who has advised US President Joe Biden on developing a new nuclear protocol, was also called upon by the Pope to formulate a policy on existential threats. \"The Pope of 2024 is aware of the fact that we are dealing with a world that is full of existential threats. These could harm humanity, from climate change to AI to nuclear war. The Pope of 1963 spoke about nuclear weapons as a threat to humanity, which was a landmark speech, and it is used as a guideline on how to use nuclear weapons,\" Cerf added. The neuroscientists added that the Pope of 2024 thinks it's time to update the policy with the current situation."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Samantha Ruth Prabhu is a force to reckon with. At the India Today Conclave 2024 , the actor spoke about carving her own path in the Indian film industry, battling Myositis, her successful career and the struggles that come with it. She was a part of a session called 'Splendid Miss Samantha: From Pushpa to The Family Man, Carving Her Own Niche' . Excerpts from the conversation: SAMANTHA ON 14 YEARS IN CINEMA It took me 14 years to be on this stage. 14 years feels like a very long time. Sometimes, when you do things you love, 14 years fly by. I don't remember that girl - she was a scared little puppy ready to please everyone. I operated from the place of fear for a long time. My resources were limited. My fear of failure drove me for the longest time. I don't even know if I had operated from the place of love and I would be able to achieve what I did now. It changed only recently. When I got sick , I realised that the fear was motivating me, but also destroying me. With life throwing this curveball at me, I thought, why me? After having gone through this ordeal for almost two years, I wouldn't have it any other way. ON BATTLING AUTO-IMMUNE DISORDER I was part of the hustle culture. You can't ever ask me to take a break. I'm doing about 10 things a day. I get five hours of sleep, and I'm productive. This was my attitude. I never gave my body and mind a break. 14 years, to be honest, were some of the unhappy years. I was suffering from impostor syndrome. I was scared that one day when I wake up, it would go away. During the biggest highs of my career, I couldn't enjoy them because of my syndrome. I never attributed the successes to me and always attributed it to someone else. The feeling of 'I've arrived' is subjective. I have finally given myself the permission to be my authentic self. This is when I feel I've arrived. ON GOING PUBLIC WITH MYOSITIS I was forced to go public about my disorder. At that time, I had my female-centric film due for release. I was very sick back then. It was hard and I wasn't ready. There were all sorts of speculation going around and misinformation being spread. The producers needed me to promote it, otherwise, it (the film) would just die. So, I agreed to do one interview. Obviously, I didn't look the same. I had high doses of medication to keep me stable. I was forced to. Given a choice, I wouldn't have come out and announced it. I was called sympathy queen by the public. My journey as an actor, as a human being, I have evolved so much. Early on in my career, I was anxious and go up (online) looking for nasty articles and what was being written about me. The more people accused me of things, I started to almost question every question every thought of mine. They have forced me to become the person that I can be proud of. When people are going through a lot of pain, they need a portal to project it. And social media is that portal I guess. I do really think that. ON HER PERFORMANCE IN 'OO ANTAVA' AND 'FAMILY MAN' The decision to do 'Oo Antava' from 'Pushpa' is similar to why I did 'Family Man'. The good side is that I didn't have to ask too many people. The decision of 'Oo Antava' came from the fact that I wanted to explore. I was never confident about my sexuality. I always thought I am not pretty and underconfident. It was a huge challenge, because sexy is not my thing. How I have grown as an actor is I put myself in difficult circumstances and fight to overcome that. It's like I'm slaying these inner demons. Many questioned me that how can I land a punch while being so petite. And I'm like, I'll show you. 'Citadel' was the hardest for me as I shot it under the most gruelling circumstances. Now, I can say I'm very proud of myself. When asked if she would do an 'item song' again, she said, 'No, it doesn't challenge me any more'. \"The lyrics of 'Oo Antava' weren't sexualising the woman. I made sure of it. I think we can move past judging about wanting to look good. We can do everything,\" she said. She was also asked to pick between 'Oo Antava' and 'Family Man'. Samantha picked Raji, her character from 'Family Man'. ON HER CHARACTER IN 'FAMILY MAN' I felt very responsible to play Raji because it was loosely based on real incidents. I am very sorry if it hurt anyone. There were many instances where it hit home and got too real. If I am going to accept another role, it should give me this fulfilment. ON TAKING A BREAK AND WAITING FOR 'THAT' ROLE I accepted many roles - some of them were vapid. I was on every poster. Actresses have this thought that they can't take breaks because of the short shelf-life. Even here, while I sit down today, I will hold down until I get that one project. I have taken a one-year break. There's this fear and challenge that maybe I'm out of sight, out of mind. Maybe I am not relevant any more. I have to beat this fear and just hold and wait for that miraculous role.I have to get past the fear of being old news. I will wait."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Indrani Mukerjea spoke about her latest Netflix documentary, 'Buried Truth', and why she \"deserves a Padma Shri award\". The former entrepreneur took the stage on Day 1 of India Today Conclave 2024, in a session titled 'Mother of All Mysteries | Buried Truth: The Indrani Mukerjea Story' . The documentary, 'Buried Truth: The Indrani Mukerjea Story', is based on the infamous Sheena Bora murder case in which Indrani is the prime accused. At the session, Indrani Mukerjea spoke about the \"media trial\" she went through during Sheena Bora's murder investigation. \"There has been a lot of hype and I have gone through a media trial. I have put myself out there for people to talk about it. A lot of people are making money at the back of the documentary ('Buried Truth: The Indrani Mukerjea Story'). And not just the production house but memes as well,\" Indrani said. \"Perhaps I did contribute to the media because I made a hot topic. I have contributed to the economy of India. That is why I should get Padma Shri (laughs),\" she added. In the Netflix documentary, there comes a segment where Indrani claims that she was \"raped\" by her own father, which resulted in the birth of Sheena. It was also mentioned that Indrani left her two children, Sheena and Mikhail Bora, with her parents when they were young. Soon after the documentary was released, questions arose as to why Indrani would leave her kids (one of them being a girl child), with an alleged perpetrator. Talking about it, Indrani Mukerjea said, \"At that point, it was a very selfish act. But it was a question of survival for me at that point. It was a wrong decision. My kids have been lucky that nothing happened. I would have killed myself had I stayed there. It felt right back then.\" She said, \"I didn’t have the ability to fight and take my kids back. It was quite heartbreaking. When I went back to meet my kids, they couldn’t recognise me. I came back. I was 21. Post that, I never looked back till my parents reached out to me asking for financial help.\" Indrani also said that she felt betrayed when her former husband Peter Mukerjea \"vanished for two hours and then vanished completely\" from her life after her arrest. \"He never came back in my life. He didn’t come to see me when I was ill,\" she said. Indrani said, \"The day I was arrested, Peter wrote to a society to stop the transfer of property to Vidhie [her daughter with her second husband, Sanjeev Khanna].\" \"On the day your wife is arrested, all you can think of is write to the society to stop transfer of property? If I was at his place, I would have been there for him,\" Indrani said. Indrani Mukerjea's documentary 'Buried Truth' is currently streaming on Netflix."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti on Friday said the United States \"can't give up on principles\" amid an exchange between the two countries over India's implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Speaking at the India Today Conclave, Eric Garcetti said the principle of religious freedom and equality was a cornerstone of democracy. The US said it was concerned about the CAA and it was closely monitoring its implementation, inviting a backlash from India. \"But you can't give up on principles, no matter how close you are with friends, or if it comes from your worst enemy, when those are principles that you stand for,\" said the Ambassador. Catch the full coverage of Conclave 2024 \"We invite you to do the same for our imperfect democracy. It's not a one-way street,\" Garcetti further said. Eric Garcetti's remark came on a day the Ministry of External Affairs, reacting to the US State Department's statement on the CAA, said those who do not understand India's pluralistic traditions better not attempt at lecturing . The Centre implemented the Citizenship Amendment Act on March 11, paving the way for citizenship to be granted to undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan who arrived in India before December 31, 2014. When asked about how the results of the upcoming US presidential elections would affect ties with India, Eric Garcetti said the relations between the two countries would not be determined by \"who's at the top\". He added that the US-India relationship does not depend on elections but on values. \"We think the same way, our heads are aligned, we feel the same way, our hearts are aligned. Now the challenge is whether our feet move together and how quickly,\" said Garcetti. He said the relationship between the two countries was held together by the people, regardless of who are the leaders. The British High Commissioner to India, Alex Ellis, reacting to a question on how the elections in the UK would impact diplomatic relations, said there was support in the United Kingdom for a deeper economic relationship between the two countries across the parties. \"The UK benefits enormously from its diversity. That's a great thing for the country. When you have a Prime Minister called Rishi Sunak, his wife is called Akshata Murthy. Those of you who went to my country 30–40 years ago, can you believe that that would happen? No. It's an incredible thing, so that diversity expresses itself in lots of different ways, including in politics and I think we are the stronger for it,\" said Alex Ellis. When asked about protests by Khalistani sympathisers and threats to Indian diplomats, Australian Ambassador to India, Philip Green, said peaceful demonstrations were a \"core part\" of his country's democracy, but violence was \"completely out of the question\". \"A huge amount of our governmental efforts goes into making sure that when there are differences between communities they're managed in a way that doesn't cause violence or harm,\" said Green. Eric Garcetti also responded to a question about the ongoing case over the allegations that an Indian agent tried to murder Khalistani sympathiser Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. He said the relationship between the US and India continues to be strong despite the case. \"It's serious, but like good friends, we dealt with it in a serious way. But the pace of our relationship only continued to accelerate even in the midst of it,\" said Garcetti. On the case, Garcetti said, \"Nobody should presuppose outcomes. Often they are politicised in a way that none of us have actually looked at the evidence or very few people have. But it's clear that we have articulated that at the highest levels there are red lines when it comes to our citizens and their rights, there's no conspiracy behind them. Life would be much better for us not to have contested democracies where people disagree, but that is the point of a democracy and something we have to defend.\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Shashwat Goenka, Vice Chairman of RP Sanjiv Goenka Group, and Keshav Reddy, Founder of Equal, shared insights into their approaches to business, leadership and the evolving landscape of entrepreneurship in India. They were speaking at a session themed 'New Generation, New Rules: Leadership in a Disruptive World' at the 21st edition India Today Conclave 2024. Goenka talked about the weight of a legacy and said that with such a great legacy comes a sense of great responsibility while also wanting to add value to it. \"With legacy comes a huge sense of responsibility. The idea for us is how to grow that legacy and build on it,\" said Goenka. He underscored the inherent culture of value addition ingrained in their family business, stating, \"There is no secret success mantra, but the culture of growing and adding value to it is ingrained in us from the time we are born.\" Reflecting on his decision to pursue business in India, Goenka noted, \"When I was graduating, I had the option to do something of my own, but somewhere I knew India is where all the action is. I was certain in 2012 that the next century is going to be India's.\" Discussing the evolving nature of business, Goenka highlighted the need for constant evolution, noting, \"Earlier, it was a generational evolution, but now the world is changing every couple of years.\" He stressed the importance of adapting to changing times, stating, \"The business model has to be dynamic to change with the changing expectations.\" Regarding their business strategy, Goenka outlined a two-pronged approach, focusing on legacy businesses while also transitioning them into consumer-first enterprises. He mentioned their commitment to touching consumers' lives positively, particularly in the unfolding Indian consumer story. Addressing their acquisition of the Lucknow Supergiants IPL franchise, Goenka stated, \"It is a step towards becoming more consumer-first and entering into sports.\" He highlighted the economic viability of sports ventures, outlining a business-centric approach. Looking ahead, Goenka discussed their plans in esports, stating, \"Sports is going to be one of the mainstays for the group going forward.\" He underscored their belief in the business potential of esports and their commitment to expanding in this space. Amid discussions on the entrepreneurial landscape, Goenka passionately expressed, \"We are in India's golden age. I say that with all my heart. In Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we have got one of the strongest leaders the world has seen.\" He lauded PM Modi's visionary leadership, attributing to him the transformation of India's ethos from \"Pehle Aap\" to \"Ab Apni Bari Hai\". Goenka pointed out the abundant opportunities for entrepreneurs in India's burgeoning market, driven by its youthful demographic dividend, and highlighted the untold potential of the Indian narrative on the global stage. Keshav Reddy, speaking at the India Today Conclave 2024, discussed the evolution of family businesses, highlighted the changing landscape and the transition towards family office constructs. He underscored the importance of blending traditional business models with modern technologies, stating, \"We build businesses with software at the core of it, but the exterior remains the old-school business as well.\" Reddy highlighted the transformative impact of Aadhar and DPI, stating, \"Aadhar and DPI have been phenomenal in putting India on the global map.\" He further said, \"Leveraging this, we aim to enhance the consumer experience through Equal. Our goal is to empower the identities of 100 million individuals, putting power in their hands. With digitalisation, Indians have become more responsible, with control over their own data.\" Reddy also said that the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP) will further bolster this, advancing data democracy where individuals utilise their data for personal benefit. \"The coming decade holds immense potential for data-driven innovation, with Indians poised to play a central role,\" said Reddy. Discussing the entrepreneurial landscape in India, Reddy highlighted the rise of startups with the increase in the number of unicorns India has seen in the past few years. He mentioned that startup founders are focusing on problem-solving and building businesses around it, particularly in regulated sectors like financial services. He pointed out the limitless potential of Indian entrepreneurs, particularly first-time entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds. Reddy expressed optimism about the conducive business environment in India, attributing it to favourable geopolitical factors and policy transparency. He outlined the role of inclusivity in driving success, particularly acknowledging the leadership potential of women."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The BJP needs to secure strongholds while focusing on challenging regions, including the eastern and southern states, to achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 400-seat dream for the NDA in the Lok Sabha polls, psephologists and poll experts said at India Today Conclave 2024. The poll experts said while PM Modi's 'Ab Ki Baar 400 paar' target was achievable, the NDA would face a tough fight from regional parties. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of 370 seats for the BJP and over 400 seats for the NDA in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Speaking on \"Who Will Win the 2024 Election?\" on the first day of the conclave, Pradeep Gupta, chairperson of Axis My India, emphasised that the BJP would need to maintain their strike rates in stronghold states while ensuring victory in other regions. He categorised the states into three major groups based on the BJP's previous electoral performance. In the first group, consisting of Maharashtra, Bihar, and Karnataka, where the BJP won around 90% of seats in the last Lok Sabha elections, the party needs to replicate the performance, Gupta said. Full coverage of Conclave 2024 However, Gupta noted that the situation had changed with the emergence of the INDIA alliance and the defeat of the BJP in Karnataka in the 2023 Assembly polls. The Axis My India chief put Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal in the second group, where the BJP secured 60 percent of votes in the previous election. He said in these states, the BJP would need to improve its performance and achieve an 80% strike rate. The third group of states, such as Tamil Nadu and Punjab, where the BJP had allies in the previous election, poses the stiffest challenge. Election strategist Amitab Tiwari noted that PM Modi’s 400-seat target was achievable with the \"regain, attain, maintain\" mantra. He said that the BJP was likely to face a tough fight in the eastern and southern states. Among the A-B-C states, categorised as per the BJP's performance, the party is safer in the A category, where they have won either three or two out of every three seats in the previous two elections. \"The A category has 262 seats, and more than half of them are in the northern belt, making them safer for the BJP. So, they have to focus on other regions to cross the 400 mark,\" Tiwari said. The 'B category' states have 82 seats, with half of them in the eastern region -- Odisha and West Bengal, where the party is poised for a tight fight, he noted. Coming to the C category of 199 seats, half of them, 98, are from the South, while the other 61 are in the eastern region. \"These are the weak regions for the BJP, which may hinder its 400-seat march,\" Tiwari said. Yashwant Deshmukh, director of C-Voter, predicted that the BJP was likely to face tough battles from regional parties rather than Congress candidates in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Deshmukh highlighted that in 100 of the 543 seats where the BJP had a vote share of less than 10% in 2014, it was unlikely to convert into seats, although there may be some exceptions. In 200 seats where the contest is primarily between the BJP and Congress, the vote share gap in 2014 was just above 20 per cent. It increased to 25 per cent in 2019. The BJP won 180 of the 200 seats in 2019. Deshmukh noted that the BJP's vote share in some of these seats was between 50-60% and the saffron party may secure around 190 seats this time. He stressed the importance of the third block of 243 seats, where the fight is between the BJP and regional parties. Deshmukh also asserted that in the seats where Congress is the opposition, there is a higher possibility for the BJP to win, especially in states like Bihar and Maharashtra. He also underscored that West Bengal would see a fierce fight for each seat. BJP Rajya Sabha MP Narasimha Rao predicted a clean sweep for the Narendra Modi-led BJP government, asserting that the winner had been decided even before the announcement of election dates. He said the opposition was decimated well before the election. \"We won 303 last time, it will be 404 this time,\" he said. Emphasising that the BJP's focus was on the 2047 'Viksit Bharat' dream, Rao said it went beyond merely fighting the election. He also touched upon opposition leaders switching to the BJP just ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, attributing it to the allure of the saffron camp for those seeking a political future."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Investment guru and author Jim Rogers said India is in a sweet spot at the moment, and it has the potential to be “even better in the future’ if the government can keep delivering on its promises. Speaking at a session during the India Today Conclave 2024, Rogers, known for expertise in commodities such as gold and silver, said, “For the first time in my life, I am beginning to think that they (the Indian government) are getting it right.” “And maybe, things are going to change, so India’s going to be even better in the future than it is now. So if Mr. Modi does what he says he is going to do, wow, India is going to be even more astonishing than it is now,” Rogers added. When asked if he is currently invested in India, Rogers said, “Well, I am not, I am embarrassed to say. The reason I am not is because the Indian stock market is making all-time highs, somebody is doing something right in India.” “At the moment, I am not investing in India because everything is going right. You’re doing a good job,” he added. Jim Rogers also said that even though gold is at an all-time high, everybody should own some. The 81-year-old veteran investor added that he also owns silver, which is down 50 per cent from its all-time high. “I own both, and if I were buying today, I would buy silver,” Rogers said. When asked about his views on Bitcoin, Jim Rogers said he has never bought the cryptocurrencies. He expects them to disappear someday. “I have never bought Bitcoin, I have never sold it. I do have a lot of gold and silver. In my view, cryptocurrencies are good trading vehicles. But I expect them all to disappear someday. Many of them have already disappeared. If you are a good trader, do it. Get rich,” he added. On where Indians should invest to create supernormal wealth, he said stock markets in the country are at an all-time high right now but suggested against staying invested in stocks for five years. “I would not suggest that you own stocks for five years because. If I were in India now, looking for something, I guess agriculture in India would be a fantastic investment for the next five years,” he added. “If any of you know how to drive a tractor, go and become a farmer,” said Rogers. When asked about his thoughts on overvaluation among asset classes and a looming crash, Jim Rogers said, “Nearly everything you mentioned is at an all-time high. That’s fabulous for anybody who is invested in the markets. But if everybody is making a lot of money, that usually is a time to get worried.” “I have been investing a long time all over the world, and when everybody is happy and singing and making money, you should start thinking about something else,” he added. Jim Rogers also shared his take on China, saying that its economy is “depressed” at the moment. He indicated that the Chinese economy has still not recovered from the devastating blow of Covid-19, and added that the property bubble made its crisis worse. He said the Chinese property market is “a huge disaster” right now, indicating that it could take the country several years to bounce back to optimal levels."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Young Indian cricketer Sarfaraz Khan has expressed gratitude towards cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar and India Today for backing his case ahead of his Test debut in the five-match series in England. Sarfaraz was reacting to Sunil Gavaskar's remarks on India Today, in which the legendary batter had urged the selectors to give the young batter a chance in Test cricket. \"I had seen the video on social media. I want to say thank you to Gavaskar sir and India Today, who have helped and supported me,\" Sarfaraz said at the India Today Conclave 2024. Gavaskar, while reacting to Sarfaraz Khan's exclusion from the Test squad in January 2023, said that selectors should not choose cricketers based on their shape or physique, but rather on their form with the bat or bowl. Gavaskar went on to say that if selectors want to select just slender and trim individuals, they should go to a fashion show and pick some models, then offer them a bat and ball and include them. India Today Conclave 2024: Full Coverage \"At the end of the day, if you are unfit, you are not going to score hundreds. So cricket fitness is most important. I don't have a problem with you wanting to do the Yo-Yo test or whatever it is, but the Yo-Yo test cannot be the only criterion. You got to make sure that the man is fit for cricket as well. And if the person, whoever it is, is fit for cricket, then I don't think it should really matter,\" Sunil Gavaskar told India Today. \"He is not staying off the field when he is scoring hundreds, he is back on the field again. All that tells you that the man is fit for cricket. If you are looking for only slim and trim guys, then you might as well go to a fashion show and pick some models and then give them a bat and ball in their hand and then include them. You have cricketers in all shapes and sizes. Don't go by the size, but go by the runs and the wickets,\" Gavaskar added. Sarfaraz was one of five debutants in the Indian team, contributing significantly to India's 4–1 series win over England under the captaincy of Rohit Sharma. Sarfaraz, who had patiently awaited his maiden Test cap, displayed fearless cricketing prowess, hitting three fifties in as many Tests during India's triumphant 4-1 victory over England in the recently concluded series. Sarfaraz also spoke at the India Today Conclave about how his father Naushad utilised poetry to motivate him , and he even recited one of them. “I would ask my father when I would get a chance to play for India and if there were people supporting us. He would tell me just one thing and he would recite it,” said Sarfaraz. “Kabhi girte toh kabhi gir ke sambhalte rehte, Baithe rehne se acha tha ki chalte rehte, Aur chalke hum gair ke kadmo se kahin ke na rahe, Khud ke pairo se chalte toh chalte rehte,” Sarfaraz recited his father’s poem. “That's what he told me that I have to score runs if I play for India and think as if you're playing for India in your next domestic match and score runs there as well. So I only had one job, that was to score runs whereever I'm playing,” Sarfaraz added."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Is secularism dying in India? The topic saw a fierce debate between two groups comprising politicians and historians at the India Today Conclave on Friday. While Trinamool Congress leader Riju Datta, one of the speakers debating for the motion, said secularism was dying because the ruling BJP practised \"majoritarianism\", BJP's Shehzad Poonawalla countered him, asserting that \"Nehruvian secularism\" gave nothing to the country. Riju Dutta, Trinamool Congress spokesperson, Ashutosh, columnist and author, and Shama Mohamed, Congress national spokesperson spoke for the motion. Shehzad Poonawalla, BJP's national spokesperson, Hindol Sengupta, historian and author, and Shehla Rashid, a human rights activist, spoke against the motion. Aryama Sundarama, senior advocate, Swapan Dasgupta, former MP and author, and Deepak Verma, President of The Debating Society of India were part of the jury. Full coverage of India Today Conclave 2024 The audience at Delhi's Taj Palace who observed the exhilarating debate voted in favour of the debaters who spoke against the motion, agreeing with them that secularism is not dying in India. Riju Dutta mentioned the old saying \"what Bengal thinks today, India will think tomorrow\" and cited the recently implemented Citizenship Amendment Act and Ram Mandir inauguration to back his remark that secularism is indeed dying in India. \"You know secularism is dying in the country when Jai Shri Ram from a warm greeting becomes a lynching war cry... when a Justice of Calcutta High Court cannot differentiate between the apostle of Hindu-Muslim, unity in Mahatma Gandhi, and a cold-blooded murderer Nathuram Godse,\" he added. Attacking the BJP, Riju Dutta said that secularism is dying because the ruling BJP at the Centre practices majoritarianism, which means \"one temple, one God, one food, one religion, one nation, one election, one party, and one leader\". Congress's Shama Mohamed said that Jawaharlal Nehru's Congress \"never mixed religion with politics or politics\", adding that he sought to prevent politicians from gaining political gains by exploiting religion and sanctioned those \"who promoted religious polarisation\". She said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi invokes religion at every opportunity and added that he speaks about Gods and religion all the time. Mohamed also cited the early release of Bilkis Bano's convicts in 2022 and gave the example of a BJP MLA at the time who said some of the 11 men were Brahmins who had good \"cultural\" values. \"Did the Prime Minister condemn it? No,\" she said. Columnist and author Ashutosh was the final speaker in support of the motion. He, too, cited ex-Justice of Calcutta High Court, Abhijit Ganguly, who recently joined the BJP. \"A high court judge who retires, joins BJP the next day. He says he cannot choose between Gandhi and Godse, needs time to think. And if we still believe that secularism in India is not dying, then one has to be delusional or ideologically blind.\" He also echoed his partners in the debate team - Riju Dutta and Shama Mohamed - is saying that the government today discriminates against citizens based on their religions. \"Secularism is no longer a guarantee by the state...(it) is no longer Modi's guarantee, unfortunately,\" Ashutosh added. Shela Rashid - speaking against the motion - compared the terror blasts in the 'golden age of secularism' to the current peace in Jammu and Kashmir in the past decade. She asked if she can be a \"proud Muslim\", why Prime Minister Narendra Modi cannot be a \"proud Hindu\". Rashid, who was once a fierce PM Modi critic, has lately taken a U-turn and has been praising the Prime Minister. She said that secularism means not discriminating against any individual and thinking beyond one's community and working for the progress of the country. Addressing Riju Dutta, Hindol Sengupta mentioned Kolkata's grand Christmas celebrations in Park Street, saying it proves secularism is not dead in the country. \"It is the same India, where six years ago, Asia's biggest church was built in Nagaland... Quite on the contrary, India is showing what secularism truly is,\" Sengupta added. BJP's national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla took the stage last to speak against the motion, saying that he wore black clothes to reiterate that \"Nehruvian secularism is dead\". \"That secularism said that women and men cannot have equal rights in the name of personal laws from Shah Ban to Triple Talaq is dead...which says that the Uniform Civil Code should be applied, and a nine-year-old should get married to a 60-year-old, who has three wives, is dead and never coming back,\" Poonawala added. The BJP leader further argued that the \"Nehruvian secularism\" gave nothing to the country, from taps to houses."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Speaking on the upcoming Lok Sabha elections and the growing support for the BJP, former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Friday said there shouldn't be any elections if the BJP's win is a 'done deal'. \"People have to vote, I cannot speak for the whole country, but I think there are places where the Congress will win. Whether it would be enough to form a government is something I cannot say,\" Chidambaram said, while speaking for the India Today Conclave 2024. His remarks came on a question of whether the Congress still has a chance against the BJP, in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. \"But let's assume that the BJP forms the government, and we will be in Opposition, but the Opposition also matters,\" he said. Full coverage of Conclave 2024 The former Finance Minister also commented on the past records and the Congress's downfall, saying, \"Yes, the BJP has been able to attract more votes, which is why it wins. But the question is, if the Congress can recover and win more votes. I think we can win more than the last time in Karnataka, Telangana, and Haryana, but I cannot make a prediction about the north Indian Hindi-speaking states.\" Responding to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's remark that 'two-third is because of what Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done, and the Opposition has no narrative other than the anti-Modism, Chidambaram said, \"Because the honourable Finance Minister turns a blind eye to facts.\" \"The Oxfam January 2024 report says 50 per cent of the population holds three per cent of the national assets, and shares 13 per cent of the national income, while according to the government, only 5 per cent of Indians are poor,\" he said. \"There is massive poverty and the unemployment rate is high,\" Chidambaram highlighted, adding, \"If you turn a blind eye towards such facts, you will of course say that all is well with the world.\" \"If the Hindutva wave is sweeping across Hindi-speaking northern India, they will vote accordingly, but you will have such problems unattended and people will suffer,\" Chidambaram said. Speaking further on how the Congress party plans to go about the unemployment crisis in the country if it comes to power, Chidambaram said, \"Wait for our manifesto.\" \"Why a voter does not vote for us is dependent on a number of factors,\" he said. Speaking for India Today's Conclave, the former Finance Minister asserted he was sure that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would make major amendments to the Constitution if he gets a third term. \"The BJP takes examples from countries that have turned their Constitution upside down,\" Chidambaram said, adding, \"Modi's third term would lead to major amendments to the Constitution, which you will regret, and I will regret,\" Chidambaram said. \"It is already some shade of an electoral autocracy, but if Mr Modi wins a third term, major amendments to the Constitution will be made. Let the BJP say they will not make any changes to the Constitution, they will not say that, and the forerunner of this is the One Nation One Election.\" Upon being asked about Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's statement that the narrative of a link between the raids and donations was based on 'assumptions', Chidambaram said, \"The day the electoral bonds were introduced, I said it is a 'legalised bribery', and I still maintain that.\" \"One system is to allow more open campaigning, but the Election Commission has placed too many restrictions. The election has been driven under the ground,\" the former Finance Minister said. \"Second, allow a larger limit of expenditure for candidates. Nobody can win, or fight an election by these ridiculously low amounts.\" \"Third, there's a simple way to state funding, and then revert to open transparent donations to political parties,\" Chidambaram said. The India Today Conclave 2024, on Friday and Saturday, will bring together visionaries, leaders, and luminaries from across the globe under one roof to delve into the essence of 'Brand Bharat: An Assertive Nation in an Uncertain World'."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Army Chief General Manoj Pande on Friday said smaller and larger countries expect New Delhi to play a more proactive role in the Indo-Pacific region amid Beijing's assertiveness, calling it \"India's moment in the sun\". Speaking at the India Today Conclave on the topic \"India and the Indo-Pacific, Threats and Opportunities\", General Manoj Pande said India's geostrategic location gave it an edge in the region, and it was time to leverage the opportunities. General Pande said the rivalry between the two superpowers -- China and the United States -- was the biggest threat in the region. The Army Chief said India, as a stakeholder in this region, had to be careful to prevent the \"contestation from turning into a conflict\". F ull coverage of Conclave 2024 \"Both China and the US have different approaches towards the Indo-Pacific. China is looking at it through a global security initiative, whereas the US is looking at the region in terms of liberal international order. There is also a hypothesis that China is looking at this region for mutual benefit. We need to be careful that this contestation doesn't turn into conflict,\" he said. The Indo-Pacific region has been key in shaping global politics in recent times. It is home to 64% of the global population, and around 50% of global trade passes through the region. General Pande said apart from the conventional threats, the region was witnessing a rise in non-conventional threats like regional rivalry, Islamic fundamentalism, cross-border human and drug trafficking, and cyber warfare. With the border standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) entering its fourth year, the Army Chief said the situation was \"stable but sensitive\". He also said the Army had ensured adequate infantry reserves across the entire length of the LAC. \"We need to keep a close watch and monitor activities across the LAC. Our deployment in terms of troops is extremely robust. Our focus is on infrastructural development, strategic road connectivity, and all-weather connectivity right up to the border,\" he said. Chinese and Indian troops have been locked in a standoff since May 5, 2020, in eastern Ladakh along the LAC. There have been reports of aggressive confrontations and skirmishes at various locations along the Sino-Indian border even though there have been resolution at certain friction points. So far, the two sides have completed the disengagement process on the north and south banks of the Pangong lake and in the Gogra area. Speaking on the rise in conflicts across the world, Army Chief General Manoj Pande said national security was gaining salience in the international system. The past two years have seen wars breaking out between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. \"Where national interests are involved, countries won't hesitate to go to war. In situations where there are contested borders, land will remain a decisive domain of warfare,\" he further said."

When asked if he regrets the decision, Narayana Murthy said, “Life is all about learning and improving.” Full coverage of Conclave 2024 “Those days I was an incorrigible idealist. Those days, the standard was family-run organisations. So, therefore, I said I want to do something different in India,” Murthy said. “One way of doing that was not to make it a husband-wife company, even though she (Sudha Murty) was much more qualified than all the founders. Let there be no doubt about it. So, it was an act of idealism,” he added. \"I have no doubt in my mind that she was truly the better half,\" Murthy said. Meanwhile, Sudha Murty said her husband's decision not to include her as part of the Infosys founding team hurt her. \"I loved engineering, and a couple of years it hurt me. But when I look back on life now, it is good that I did not become part as I would've retired as a technical director of Infosys. But I touched many lives through Infosys Foundation and I value it much more than any other position,\" Sudha Murty said. \"Being compassionate to others is more important that any position.

Speaking at the India Today Conclave 2024, the Mysuru-based artist revealed that he had a 20-minute window to carve the deity's eyes, which captured the public's attention after the idol's grand Pran Pratishtha. \"They gave me 20 minutes to sculpt the eyes. I had to go through various rituals before the mahurat, like taking a bath in the Saryu,\" Arun Yogiraj said. Yogiraj said he was confident that he could complete the feat in the allotted time, but admitted that he felt enormous pressure as the eyes were an indispensable aspect of Ram Lalla's idol. Full coverage of Conclave 2024 Yogiraj said he was tasked with a huge responsibility as the entire nation has been waiting for Ram Lalla's homecoming. \"From day one, when I started sculpting, my thought process was that it is not my work, He will get it done through me.\" The young sculptor's skill resulted in remarkably expressive and deep eyes, conveying a sense of compassion and tranquility from the visage of the five-year-old Lord Ram . This was particularly impressive, considering the black stone used is harder to work with for details compared to white stone. In a remarkable demonstration of his skills, Arun Yogiraj chiselled the eyes and lips on an idol of Lord Shiva before a live audience at the India Today Conclave, which is underway at the Taj Palace Hotel in New Delhi. (India Today/Arun Kumar) Arun Yogiraj is a sculptor from Karnataka's Mysuru, belonging to a fifth-generation family of skilled carvers. He rose to fame for creating the new idol of Ram Lalla, the child form of Lord Ram, for the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Chosen from three sculptors, Arun Yogiraj worked under immense pressure and with a deep sense of responsibility. Unlike existing depictions, this Ram idol portrayed him as a young boy . To capture the essence, Yogiraj spent months researching and observing children aged 3-9. The idol itself was carved from a special stone called Krishna Shila and reportedly took several months to complete. Yogiraj reportedly even suffered an eye injury during the process but persevered."

Speaking at the 21st edition of the India Today Conclave 2024 in New Delhi, Arvind Subramanian said, \"I can't understand the latest GDP numbers, they are mystifying, and don't add up. For example, the implied inflation numbers given by the government are between 1-1.5%, but the actual inflation is around 3-5%.\" He also pointed out that while the economy was growing at 7.5%, private consumption was lagging at 3%. As per the latest GDP numbers, the Indian economy grew at a rate of 8.4 per cent in the third quarter of the financial year of 2024, a six-quarter high. F ull coverage of Conclave 2024 Moreover, the GDP figures for the first and second quarters of the ongoing financial year were revised to 8.2 per cent and 8.1 per cent, up from 7.8 per cent and 7.6 per cent respectively. Subramanian, who served as the chief economic adviser from October 2014 to June 2018, also flagged that foreign direct investment (FDI) had declined very sharply in the last two or three quarters. \"It's not just India's FDI coming down, but also India's share of global FDI going to emerging markets has also come down. So the question is, if India has become such an attractive place to invest, why isn't there more FDI? Corporate investment is also well below 2016 levels,\" he said. Subramanian, however, lauded the revival of manufacturing in southern states and the government's Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and Atmanirbhar Bharat policy. \"Factories are coming up on a large scale, employing anywhere between 5,000-50,000 workers. Moreover, India is also gaining global market share in service exports,\" he further said."

Speaking at the 21st edition of the India Today Conclave 2024 in New Delhi, Sitharaman called the Opposition \"hypocrites\". \"What is revdi for you is not revdi for them,\" the Finance Minister said. When asked what reforms have been put in place to unlock India's full potential, Sitharaman said, \"In no order of priority, the right kind of reforms which we need to undertake now, I would think in whichever sector you would want to take it, it will have to have a greater coordination between the Centre, the states and the urban local bodies, panchayats and so on.\" Full coverage of Conclave 2024 \"In the last 10 years, in my experience, let me tell you, you may do wonderful futuristic reforms at the central government level, and most states understand that it benefits them as well, and they also do in synchrony things which are going to help both Centre and the states,\" the Union Minister said. \"It is only when you touch the third layer, you find many of them are almost blocked. It is not an intentional block, but it is more a question of understanding of what it can do for them and also trying to make sure that they can easily slip into that process.\" She further said that \"when all those great reforms are happening elsewhere and not in the panchayat level, it is not going to help at all\". \"There has to be a lot of work done, from the top level in the sense of the Centre, state and the third level. I think, across the sectors when you undertake reforms, it has to have that effect of cascading down to the lowest level,\" she added. On being asked about the government having to deal with tricky reform sectors, like land and agriculture, as well those where progress hasn't been made yet, Sitharaman said, \"With due respect to those who protested, I would like to say that those bills passed in Parliament. You can have a thousand commentaries on it saying could the debate in Rajya Sabha be held for one extra hour, it would have brought in more speakers. You can nitpick on such things.\" \"But they were the very reforms that, when in power, those governments, (and) those ministers who held power at the time, were all watching. They wanted agriculture reform and land reform, labour codes. These are things when people wanted it, they spoke very much about it. Records in Parliament show it,\" Sitharaman said. \"But when you politically, conveniently sit in the Opposition, protest against every one of these (reforms), your hypocrisy is what is getting exposed. When people see a delivering government, a visionary Prime Minister and many other things which this government has done, I think they are also seeing how hypocritical it is to protest against every good measure this government took,\" she said. She went on to say that if an \"environment is building up for the Prime Minister to come back, it is because of two-thirds of what the government has done and the vision with which this government is functioning and at least a third goes to those hypocrites who wasted Parliament's time\". \"Hypocrites who spoke in favour of some policies, are speaking against it now. It is a blend of hypocritical opposition which has got exposed and the fantastic work which the Prime Minister has done during the most difficult time and with transparency in the last 10 years.\" When asked to comment on 'revdi' politics, Nirmala Sitharaman said, \"What is 'revdi' for you is not 'revdi 'for them. You do not have budgetary support for some fantastic idea you throw about. And then once you get the vote, you don’t have money to fund that.\" \"And then you go about blaming the Central government, which has not sought a vote with you for the same 'revdi'. But you want the Central government to fund you because you had this fancy basket of lollipops for the people,\" she said. Giving the example of Karnataka, Sitharaman said, \"A state one year ago was doing very well. The Global Investors' Summit drew the best of people to come and invest in the state, because it is an excellent state that draws talent from all over the country, beautifully endowed and has the right blend of culture, industry, and enterprise.\" \"Now what is the status of affairs in Karnataka? And who is to blame? It hurts me so much to say that even Bengaluru city doesn't have drinking water. Within a year you can see what the 'revdi' can do? And now you want the Centre to fund your 'revdi'? And you blame saying the Centre is discriminating? And there is another angle of taking us to the court. I am very happy to go to court and put all the facts before the court,\" she added. When asked the Union Finance Minister to comment on whether the \"North-South divide\" is a crucial concern that will escalate during campaigning for the Lok Sabha polls, Sitharaman said, \"Yes, they (Opposition) want to escalate it because it can keep the narrative going in the direction in which they want.\" \"The North-South divide has been one of the pet themes of state-level parties who think it's a good idea to hit at the Centre and nobody from the Centre will be able to defend themselves in that particular state. I grew up in Tamil Nadu, where when the Congress party was in alliance there, as well as in power at the Centre, even then I heard slogans propagating North-South divide,\" Sitharaman said. She called it a \"typical political narrative which, particularly, the DMK has always used to give an impression that the Centre is not giving its due to the states\". \"When the ministers from their alliance never refuted it, that narrative happily found traction. Today, each one of us goes there to speak about what the central government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is doing. Hence, there are friction points in their narrative which try to show that the country's North is completely different from its South,\" the Minister noted. As data from the State Bank of India released by the Election Commission (EC) revealed that at least 14 out of the top 30 companies which purchased electoral bonds faced action by central or state probe agencies, the Finance Minister termed the \"talk\" of links between probe agency raids and election bonds as \"assumptions\" . Nearly half of the top 30 firms contributing to political parties via electoral bonds have been investigated by central probe agencies, including the Enforcement Directorate, Central Bureau of Investigation, and Income Tax departments. \"I think you've based yourself on huge assumptions, that the money was given after the Enforcement Directorate raid happened,\" Sitharaman said, commenting on a question about the data released. \"For all you know, the money was given earlier, and despite that, we went knocking at their doors,\" she said. \"What if the companies gave the money, and after that, we still went and knocked at their doors through the Enforcement Directorate? That's an assumption that the ED went and knocked at their doors, they wanted to save themselves, and therefore they came up with the funds.\" She went on to say that the \"second assumption in that itself is, are you sure they gave it to the BJP? They probably gave it to the regional parties\". Sitharaman also questioned if \"the earlier systems 100 per cent perfect.\" \"Let us just recall what my predecessor (former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley), when he brought these electoral bonds, said, 'this is better than the previous systems as the money is going from accounts to party's account',\" she said. \"It's not a perfect system, but we have moved from a system where everyone did what they wanted to do. A system which was not perfect, from a system which was completely imperfect, was brought in.\" When asked to comment on the Opposition calling the Centre's decision to reduce fuel prices and LPG cylinder rates as an election gimmick, the Union Finance Minister said it was wrong. \"In November 2021 and June 2022, the excise duty on fuel was reduced. Now, there is a Rs 100 reduction for LPG cylinders and earlier there was a Rs 200 cut. Due to this, the Ujjwala scheme beneficiaries are now getting a total reduction of Rs 300. Regardless of calling this a pre- or post-poll gimmick, we will do what is best for the public and continue doing so,\" Sitharaman said. Without mentioning the names, Nirmala Sitharaman said that when the Centre announced the reduction, there were some states which did not cut down their rates despite making a promise in their poll manifestos. \"They did not stand by their promises. Now do you want to question us or them? They make promises before the election, but don't do anything even after they secure a win,\" she added. The Union Finance Minister, while commenting on the Opposition's criticism of the Central government on the unemployment issue, said, \"I also have a question for the opposition regarding government jobs. When they were in power in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and now in Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh, they should have at least shown a 'jhalak' (glimpse). Then we will vote for them in the Lok Sabha elections\". Taking a jibe at Congress MP Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, she said, \"They don't do anything and just keep roaming around, Bharat ko ye Jodo, Bharat ko woh dojo\" . \"One should not roam around with such a scattered mind. Sit in one place, plan,\" she said."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story India Today Group Chairman Aroon Purie kicked off the India Today Conclave 2024. Here's his full speech: Honoured Guests. Good morning. Welcome to the 21st edition of the India Today Conclave. Full coverage of Conclave 2024 The theme of our Conclave last year was the 'India Moment'. Well, I can confidently say the India Moment has only got bigger. Much bigger. Lets be ambitious and call it the ‘India Movement’. This way we remind ourselves of the work that needs to be done. So that we keep asking ourselves the big question “What’s next”? What can we do today to ensure that the India Moment lasts as long as possible? And convert it into a Movement. So that it transforms India like no other in the past. To me, the best way to build a better future is to have a clear vision of that future. And then work toward turning that vision into reality. Today, I want to submit to you five images of India’s future that I think are within our grasp. Firstly, forget about the Poverty Line, which is so often discussed in India and let's convert it into what I would call the Dignity Line. Less than a month ago the government released data that suggest extreme poverty in India is almost eliminated. It is now indeed restricted to less than 2% of India’s population. But I must tell you that extreme poverty is a very low bar to clear. According to the World Bank, poverty is defined as the consumption expenditure of $2.15 PPP dollars a day. (Purchasing Power Parity) means dollar value is about half the value of the US dollar. This means roughly Rs 1,200 -to- Rs 1,500 a month or just Rs 40 – 50 a day. In the last 10 years, the present government has done a remarkable job of lifting more than 200 million people above the extreme poverty line. Now lets set the bar to dignity line. It’s the line that measures the means to lead a life of basic dignity. That includes food of course, but it also includes access to basic housing, electricity, clean water, education and healthcare. And of course, a job that gives you a basic income. I think Prime Minister Modi has grasped the idea of delivering a life of dignity for the people at the bottom of the pyramid from the moment he took office 10 years ago. That is why his emphasis on schemes like Swachh Bharat and delivering tap water and electricity to every household. Also, Niti Ayog does not measure poverty by the poverty line but by what they call multi-dimensional poverty. This is a most welcome step. The current estimate suggests 11.3% of Indians are below the multi-dimensional poverty line. Five years from now, we should target either zero or no more than 2% of Indians below this line. That's when every Indian will have a fair shot at making the most of the opportunity life offers to us. Second, is Education. No country has become a developed one without a good education system. In education, we have solved the problem of enrolment. But what happens—or doesn’t happen--between enrolment and graduation remains unaddressed. This shows up in large teaching-learning gaps on the one hand and historically high youth unemployment on the other. A recent learning survey showed 25% of 14–18-year-old could not read a simple class—2 level text in their regional language. Less than 50% of them could not solve grade 2 level math. This is a very sad state of affairs that does not bode well for the future of this country. Quality of education—from curriculum to pedagogy to delivery—hasn’t kept pace with enrolments. This is true at all levels of education—primary, secondary and college. At college level, education must be linked to employability. Most recent data show youth unemployment to be at 16.5%. In five years from now, we must aim to reduce our youth unemployment to no more than 5%. This has to change dramatically and quickly. If we use it seriously AI can help us here. In a matter of months, not years, our children could have access to the highest quality education customized to their level of understanding. Delivered to them right at their home, in their native language for almost free of cost. This is distinct doable because India has one of the finest public digital infrastructure in the world. I hope the government, NGOs and tech companies in India join hands to bring such solutions to every student. I see AI as a source of free intellectual energy. Let’s open it up for our young minds. Thirdly, how we deliver the best healthcare to the remotest Indian village is the next big challenge. India has been late in understanding the direct correlation between human capability and human capital. Healthcare, along with education, is the essential ingredient for converting our biggest capability into our best capital. For the next five years, we should aim to achieve the following two. - Bringing our infant mortality rate to 5 per 1000 live birth from 25 right now. - We have done a remarkable job in bringing our life expectancy from 32 years at the time Independence to over 70 years right now. But now we have to focus on healthy life expectancy and not just life expectancy. India is the capital of too many diseases. Like for education, for healthcare too, I think, AI may be godsend for India. It allows an inexpensive and fast way to combine the ‘practice of medicine’ with ‘science of medicine’, which is what we need to deliver best quality primary care to the remotest places in India. Fourth, from 'Make in India’ we should move to ‘Make better than the best’ in India. By this I mean we should be setting world standards. For example:- We have in India one of the world’s biggest and most efficient oil refineries. Some of our seaports are the most modern and our airports are world class. At the turn of this century how many of you would have imagined India exporting automobiles and being home to building the highest quality smartphones? Thanks to developments like ‘China + one’ and policies like ‘Make in India’ we have the tide in our favour that can take us from ‘Make in India’ to ‘Make better than the best in India’. We have what is called the \"last mover advantage”. We can start with the latest technologies especially now that we are getting into semi-conductor manufacturing. I think we are at the cusp of a golden era in Indian manufacturing. Today India accounts for little over 3% of global manufacturing and China little over 28%. In five years, we should aim 8% global share. Remember, in 1995 China had only 3% share. Lastly, we are on the way to become the 3rd largest economy in the world in terms of our GDP. But becoming an economic giant is not an end by itself. We have to become a Great Nation. We cannot rise economically and descend in our conduct and our character. -can we be a great nation without knowing which side of the road to drive on? Every year, nearly 10,000 Indians lose lives in accidents caused by people driving on the wrong side of the road. -Can we be a great nation with ever rising mountains of garbage surrounding our urban centers. -Can we be a great nation if most of our cities and towns are choking with pollution. -Can we be a great nation when lynching or beating a person to death becomes commonplace. -Can we be a great nation when we are regarded as the rape capital of the world. Also, violence against women is treated as a routine affair. -Can we be a great nation if our election funding is open to question. -Can we be a great nation by confusing disagreement with dissent, dissent with disloyalty and disloyalty with treason? -Can we be a great nation if we live in fear of our government There are many more hard questions like these that I am sure you ask yourself every day. And I think most of you know the answer. It’s a resounding NO. We need to measure what I call our Gross Domestic Behaviour—GDB if you like—just as we measure GDP. So that our nation building goes hand in hand with our character building. So that as we become an economic giant, we also become a social and moral giant. Twenty years ago--2003, to be precise-- President Bill Clinton had told India Today conclave something that has remained in my mind. He said “I have no doubt India will be a giant. But what kind of a giant? You must become a global giant, and of the right kind”. Here's to becoming the Right Kind of Giant. Like always we have wide range of subjects and speakers for you to listen to in the next two days. I invite you to enjoy our festival of ideas. All of India Today Group is here to host you and make the best of the two days you have spared for us. Honoured Guests, I thank you for your time and attention."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The New Delhi-based Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) has announced a major call for proposals to fund projects aimed at boosting infrastructure resilience in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) around the world. The funding opportunity was unveiled at the United Nations 4th International Conference on SIDS in Antigua and Barbuda. Open to all 57 SIDS nations, the call will provide technical support, knowledge resources, and financial assistance to equip the island countries with more robust and climate-resilient infrastructure across critical sectors like transport, power, telecommunications, water, health, and education. \"This funding will support SIDS with the knowledge products, tools and partnerships needed to achieve climate and disaster resilient infrastructure , enabling resilient economies and a secure future,\" said Amit Prothi, Director General of CDRI. Proposed projects can focus on enhancing policies, regulatory frameworks, project preparation capacities, resource mobilisation, project implementation, and data systems related to making infrastructure more resistant to natural disasters and climate change impacts. The award highlights IRIS's innovative partnerships promoting sustainable development. (Photo: CDRI) The initiative comes as low-lying island nations face escalating risks from sea level rise, intensifying storms, flooding, and other environmental threats that can devastate critical infrastructure like roads, utilities, hospitals and more. In recognition of its efforts, CDRI's Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS) was awarded the 2024 UN SIDS Partnership Award in the Environment category during the conference. The award highlights IRIS's innovative partnerships promoting sustainable development in SIDS through disaster-resilient infrastructure advocacy , funding, workshops and capacity building programs. \"I am pleased to share that IRIS has won the 2024 UN SIDS Partnership Award in recognition of contributions to the sustainable development of SIDS through innovative and impactful partnerships,\" Prothi stated. The new funding call represents a significant opportunity for SIDS to access technical and financial resources to fortify infrastructure against climate change at a critical juncture. With many islands already experiencing coastal erosion, freshwater contamination and other impacts, boosting resilience is crucial for safeguarding communities and economic development. Detailed criteria, guidelines and submission procedures for the CDRI resilience project proposals will be issued in the coming weeks. The coalition aims to rapidly deploy support to address the urgent resilience needs facing SIDS worldwide."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Horticulture is an important economic sector in Uttarakhand, the state also referred as India's fruit basket. The mountains, lush green valleys, and undulating plains of the state, with their diverse climatic conditions, are ideal for the production of both temperate and sub-tropical fruits. Once a leading producer of pear, peach, plum, and apricot and the third largest producer of high-quality apples in the country, the yield of major fruit crops has plummeted significantly in the state over the last seven years. The decline in yield and area under cultivation of major fruits has been stark since 2020. The dip is particularly remarkable for temperate fruits compared to their tropical counterparts. Changing temperature patterns in the state could partially explain the shifting horticultural production. With the warming climate rendering certain fruit varieties less productive, farmers are shifting towards tropical alternatives, which are better attuned to the altering climatic conditions. The total yield of fruits in 2016-2017 was 662,847.11 metric tonnes. (Photo: Getty) According to the Department of Horticulture, Government of Uttarakhand, the total area under fruit cultivation in Uttarakhand in 2016-2017 was 177,323.5 hectares. The decline in area under cultivation and yield of all types of fruit crops in Uttarakhand was reported in 2022-2023, with 81,692.58 hectares, representing a 54% decline. Similarly, the total yield of fruits in 2016-2017 was 662,847.11 metric tonnes, which declined to 369,447.3 metric tonnes in 2022-2023, marking nearly a 44% decline. Uttarakhand has witnessed a massive shrinkage in the area under horticulture production, coinciding with the declining yields of major fruit crops. Cultivated in the higher altitudes of the Himalayas, temperate fruits like pear, apricot, plum, and walnut have seen the maximum fall in production. Apples and lemons have been moderately hit. The area under apple production reduced from 25,201.58 hectares in 2016-17 to 11,327.33 hectares in 2022-23, with a corresponding 30% decline in yield. The yield of lemon varieties shrunk by 58%. Tropical fruits were less affected. Despite nearly 49% and 42% reductions in cultivation area, the production of mango and litchi remained relatively stable, with slight declines of 20% and 24%, respectively. Conversely, guava showed a notable increase of 36.64% in production area from 3,432.67 hectares in 2016-17 to 4,690.32 hectares in 2022-23. Gooseberry and guava showed significant rises in yield, marked by 63.77% and 94.89%, respectively, indicating positive trends for these fruits during the same timeframe. The area under apple production reduced from 25,201.58 hectares in 2016-17 to 11,327.33 hectares in 2022-23. (Photo: Getty) The variations in fruit production area in Uttarakhand between 2016-17 and 2022-23 reveal striking shifts in cultivation patterns across different fruit types. Substantial reductions in certain fruit varieties over the past seven years suggest changes in agricultural strategies, land allocation, market dynamics, and possibly environmental influences affecting specific fruits. The increase in production of guava and gooseberry indicates a shift in focus towards fruit types better attuned to market demand or local conditions. Warming can partly explain these profound changes in horticulture production. Shifts in temperature patterns directly impact fruit growth, development, and overall productivity. Higher temperatures can also pose challenges such as heat stress, reduced water availability, and altered precipitation patterns, negatively affecting yields. Additionally, changing temperature regimes can influence the prevalence and distribution of pests and diseases in fruits, necessitating adaptation through pest management strategies. \"From our hamlet, 1500 boxes a day of apple were supplied during peak season. This year, it seems like less than 350 boxes a day will be ready in the season,\" said Dheeraj Joshi, an apple and peach farmer at the Satpuri hamlet near Hartola village of Uttarakhand. The average temperature in Uttarakhand increased at an annual rate of 0.02 degrees Celsius between 1970 and 2022. The state recorded approximately 1.5 degrees Celsius warming over the same period, with higher elevations experiencing amplified rates of warming . Research reveals that relatively warmer winter temperatures in the higher altitudes have accelerated snow melt, triggering a rapid decline in snow cover areas. In the past 20 years, winter temperatures at high elevations in the state have increased at the rate of 0.12°C/decade. Precipitation has fallen by 11.2 mm per decade, resulting in a rapid shrinking of snow cover area at the rate of -58.3 square km/decade. In Uttarkashi, Chamoli, Pithoragarh, and Rudra Prayag districts, snow cover areas have shrunk by nearly 90-100 km² in 2020 compared to 2000. The yield of major fruit crops has plummeted significantly in the state over the last seven years. (Photo: Getty) Winter chill and snow are prerequisites for the growth and flowering of fruits like apples, plums, peaches, apricots, pears, and walnuts, grown in the higher altitudes of the Himalayas. While higher temperatures in the upper altitudes of the Himalayas are melting snow covers, lack of precipitation in early winter months is preventing fresh snow accumulation, depriving temperate fruit trees of their requisite chilling hours, thereby altering the flowering time. The peach and plum are also significantly low in the orchards. Narayan Bhatt, who owns a plum orchard in the same hamlet, said, \"This has happened for the first time since I was born. No snowfall since last 2-3 years and very less rains have led to very poor farm produce. The temperature in our area is rising above 31 during the month of May, which is also drying up the water sources.\" During winters, temperate trees enter a phase of dormancy when growth is halted to avoid cell damage from low temperatures. Exposure to extreme cold, understood as the “chilling requirement,” is necessary for such trees to come out of dormancy and initiate bud formation, blooming, and fruit inception. Exceptionally warm winters, less snowfall, and shrinking snow cover area may have caused abnormal patterns of bud-break and subsequently reduced flowering, pollination, and yields of temperate fruits. “Traditional temperate crops like high-quality apples have a chilling requirement of less than 7 degrees Celsius for 1,200-1,600 hours during the period of dormancy (Dec-March). Apples require 2-3 times more snowfall than what the region received in the last 5-10 years, leading to poor quality and yield,” explained Dr. Pankaj Nautiyal, Head & Senior Scientist, Horticulture, ICAR-CSSRI, Krishi Vigyan Kendra. “Lack of winter snow and rain is posing a major hurdle in fruit production,” mentioned Mohan Chaubatia, a farmer from Ranikhet. He further added that production of temperate fruits has reduced to half in the last two decades in Almora. Farmers who cannot afford irrigation have been the worst affected due to the increasingly dry winters and low fruit productivity in the state. Uttarakhand has also been in the eye of recurring disasters ranging from extreme rainfall events, flooding, hailstorms, and landslides, resulting in significant damage to agricultural fields and standing crops. In 2023, 44,882 hectares of farmlands were lost to extreme weather events. Dwindling agricultural prospects have also led to widespread out-migration from the hills to the plains, which could also explain the shrinking area under horticultural production. While warmer temperatures hinder the growth of winter fruits, farmers are shifting to tropical alternatives. In some districts of Uttarakhand, farmers are choosing low-chilling cultivars of apples or replacing hard nut fruits like plum, peach, and apricot with tropical alternatives like kiwi and pomegranate. There has also been experimentation with high-density cultivation of the Amrapali variety of mango in the lower hills and valleys of Uttarkashi district, which generated high returns for farmers. The declining horticulture production in the state of Uttarakhand paints a dull future for a once thriving industry. Dr. Subash Nataraja, Head, Division of Agricultural Physics, ICAR-IARI, New Delhi, expressed that “The short-term variability and trends in temperature are worrying, and there is a need to study the long-term trends in weather variables and their relation to yield, especially, their relation with any change in crop/cropping pattern or shift in crop/cropping pattern.\" With changing climatic conditions rendering the production of temperate fruits less viable, the state is on the verge of losing its rich diversity of fruit varieties. It is therefore necessary to shift towards climate-resilient practices to safeguard the horticulture sector from future risks. Dr. Nataraja further suggested that “there is a need to identify/develop location-specific climate-resilient varieties and management practices to reduce the i mpact of climate change and climate variability. Moreover, climate financing is essential to save the farming community from adverse weather aberrations. Another point is we need to advocate village-level agromet advisory services and their dissemination to various stakeholders in a timely manner so that they can prepare against adverse situations and make decisions accordingly.”"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story India is being hit by one of its worst heatwaves streaks ever, with many parts of the country experiencing consistent temperatures of over 50ºC. On Wednesday, an outlier temperature above 52ºC was reported in Delhi, but this is still being evaluated and rechecked. City authorities have also warned of a risk of water shortages and the power grid tripping. Delhi’s city record of 49.2ºC from 2002 had been broken the day before, with temperatures reaching 49.9ºC on May 27, 2024. Climate change, predominantly caused by burning fossil fuels and exacerbated by human interference, is making heatwaves hotter and more likely to happen everywhere in the world, according to scientists who study how extreme events are changing. Cities are more vulnerable to the compounding effects of urbanisation and climate change. According to the IPCC, heatwaves that occurred once every 10 years without human-caused warming are now likely to occur 2.8 times more often (or once every 3.6 years) and are 1.5ºC warmer because of climate change caused by burning fossil fuels. Since last week, the entire Northwest India, especially parts of Rajasthan and the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR), have been under the grip of severe heat waves. (Photo: PTI) Extreme heatwaves that occurred once every 50 years without human-caused warming are now likely to occur 4.8 times more often (or once every 10.4 years) and are 1.5ºC warmer. If emissions are not cut much faster than planned, they will become 2-3 times more common again. Dr. Krishna AchutaRao, Professor and Dean, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, says, \"The widespread, long-lasting, and intense heatwave conditions over India and many other parts of the world are the direct result of climate change caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases. There is an urgent need to take adaptation steps to control the rising global average temperatures; else, the result is in front of us.\" Extreme heat forced schools to close early for the summer in India. Temperatures in at least 37 cities exceeded 45ºC, with warnings of a “very high likelihood” of heat illnesses for the entire population. Nighttime temperatures remained as high as 36ºC in some locations, which is particularly dangerous as it means people cannot cool off at night. There have been over 16,000 heat stroke cases and 60 heat-related deaths since March 2024, although this number is likely a huge underestimate. Heat in India and South Asia is characterised by being extremely humid, which makes it more dangerous for human health. High humidity levels prevent the body from cooling itself through sweating, raising the risk of heat strokes and other life-threatening conditions. The combination of intense heat and humidity poses life-threatening risks to the population, exposing them to conditions that exceed human tolerance. This risk is further increased in cities, as they are often warmer than rural areas. Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends, says, \"Heatwaves are clearly the single largest threat to India's well-being today. Record-breaking heat of over 48ºC across north, west, and central India shows that the climate crisis is a nice-to-push rhetoric as long as one hasn't experienced a 50ºC heatwave. Temperatures in Delhi and neighboring National Capital Region (NCR) states since the last two days are proof that the issue is now about survivability, and it’s no longer a problem 'elsewhere'. As more and more Indian cities develop faster, climate resilience needs to be incorporated immediately to reduce the compounding impacts of extreme heat on human health, the economy, and livelihoods.\" A dedicated study is no longer necessary to understand whether climate change made a particular heatwave hotter, as this is now the case for all heatwaves. Extreme event attribution studies have evaluated how much hotter and more likely climate change made past heatwaves in India in 2022, 2023, and 2024; all concluded that burning fossil fuels made these events dramatically more likely to happen. Human-induced climate change is also increasing the temperatures that are reached during each heat episode, putting millions of lives at risk. Heat in India and South Asia is characterised by being extremely humid. (Photo Getty) “This is a wake-up call for urgent transformations to reduce the impact of the heat island effect. Between 1970 and 2018, India's urban population has increased fourfold to 460 million. That's more than one-third of Indians living in extreme vulnerability to climate threats, impacting both productivity and health,\" says Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends. Dr. Friederike Otto, Imperial College London and Director of World Weather Attribution, says, \"This devastating heat is not a natural disaster. The suffering India is facing this week is worse because of climate change caused by burning coal, oil, and gas, and deforestation. What we are seeing in India is exactly what scientists said would happen if we didn’t stop heating the planet. To avoid making the problem worse, the world needs to end fossil fuel use. Unless we do it, terrible heat like this will happen more and more often, and it will get even hotter. The heat will become worse, and the death toll will continue to rise fast.” Mahesh Palawat, Vice President of Meteorology and Climate Change at Skymet Weather, says, “Since last week, the entire Northwest India, especially parts of Rajasthan and the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR), have been under the grip of severe heat waves. Maximum temperatures have been constantly above the 45ºC mark, which has made the current heatwave a prolonged one. “We saw a similar spike in temperatures in 2016 on account of El Niño, which is a natural and temporary driver of global warming. However, climate change has made things worse for India. El Niño will continue to form in the Pacific Ocean, but we need to limit average global temperatures at any cost; otherwise, similar situations will arise again and again. “Climate change has been making heat waves more intense and frequent. 2024 is again a reminder of this.” Dr. Akshay Deoras, Research Scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of Reading, UK, says, “This year’s summer season in India is very unique. While frequent thunderstorms and cloud cover prevented the onset of high temperatures and heat waves over most of the country between March and mid-May, a stable weather pattern has been instigating heat waves for the last couple of days. With a persistent maximum temperature above 45ºC, a crunched summer season is turning out to be deadly across northwestern India, and El Niño is playing an important role in boosting temperatures this year. “We already have clear evidence of global warming increasing the frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves across the globe, and El Niño is adding more to this effect.” Prof. Vidhya Venugopal, Country Director at Sri Ram Institute of Higher Education & Research, Chennai, says, “The unequal impacts of heat waves, especially with temperatures beyond 50ºC in dry environments like Delhi, will affect the most vulnerable, such as the elderly, young children, workers exerting outdoors, people with comorbidities, and the poor with minimal cooling interventions. “When an individual is dehydrated, extreme heat exposure will thicken their blood and cause organs to shut down, resulting in death within hours, popularly called 'heat stroke'. Extreme heatwaves that occurred once every 50 years without human-caused warming are now likely to occur 4.8 times more often. (Photo: Getty) “We urgently need customized interventions for various stakeholders, preparedness to handle health emergencies, and action to protect exposed populations. With or without evidence, action is urgent.” Aditya Valiathan Pillai, Fellow, Sustainable Futures Collaborative, says, “Delhi’s sustained high temperatures nearing the 50s bring the focus back on its Heat Action Plan. In this infernal heat, millions of heat-exposed workers without access to cooling will struggle to earn their wages, protect their families, and stay safe. Heatwave preparedness and response measures in Delhi’s newly minted Heat Action Plan must be implemented immediately. “Of equal importance are long-term solutions like trees, changing how buildings are structured, and reducing the density of built areas to combat the urban heat island effect. Today’s heat is yet another reminder of the terrible toll climate change will exact on India’s most vulnerable.” Dr. Arun Sharma, Professor of Community Medicine, suggests, “Exposure to high atmospheric temperatures is harmful to the human body. Prolonged exposure to such high temperatures can cause heat stroke. It is recognized by fever above 104°F, dry skin, and loss of consciousness. High temperatures may also cause sunburn, irritation in the eyes, and dehydration. To protect yourself, avoid exposure to direct sunlight, use an umbrella and sunglasses. Keep the body hydrated with frequent, small intakes of water, fruit juice, coconut water, lemon drinks, etc. Avoid going out in extreme heat conditions. Sunscreen lotions also help in protecting against adverse effects on the skin. If eyes start itching, wash them frequently with clean, cold water. Avoid sudden changes in temperature, like walking out of air-conditioned rooms straight into sunlight and vice versa.”"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The world must make peace with nature or risk fueling more global conflicts like the war in Gaza, the president of the upcoming United Nations COP16 biodiversity summit said on Friday. The October summit in Colombia is charged with negotiating next steps to implement the landmark 2022 Kunming-Montreal accord - likened to the Paris Agreement on climate change, opens new tab, but for nature - in order to address the drastic decline in biodiversity globally. Climate change, deforestation, pollution and habitat destruction have led to a 69% decline in global wildlife populations since 1970, according to nonprofit WWF. Colombia's Environment Minister, Susana Muhamad, laid out her priorities as COP16 president, along with a warning if the world fails to reform global governance to solve problems like the climate crisis. \"The situation currently in Palestine, where humanity is observing how a people of the world is being crushed militarily. And there's not even the capacity of the U.N. to provide the humanitarian relief,\" Muhamad said during a five-minute speech at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington. \"Suicidal war against nature\" is causing conflict to increase. (Photo: AP) \"That situation is what we could expect in a lack of governance and in a chaotic world because of the climate crisis.\" Muhamad said the \"suicidal war against nature\" is causing conflict to increase but did not elaborate on the connection. Multilateral institutions are not equipped to deal with unprecedented challenges like climate change and must be overhauled or risk the world slipping into rule by the strong through violence, Muhamad said. Colombia's top priorities for COP16 include an \"intense\" discussion on how to reform the global financial system that will allow developing countries to make strong environmental commitments without taking on more debt, she said. Countries must submit biodiversity targets before the summit. Colombia will prioritize working with U.N. officials to measure how those commitments line up with 2030 goals in the Kunming-Montreal agreement, she said. Colombia will also seek to boost the participation of Indigenous people and traditional communities in the process, by organizing three pre-summit events giving them an opportunity to lobby governments."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The second annual Indicators of Global Climate Change report, led by the University of Leeds, has sounded an urgent alarm about the rapidly accelerating pace of human-induced global warming. The analysis reveals that warming caused by human activities reached a staggering 1.19°C over the past decade (2014-2023), up from 1.14°C in the previous decade. Alarmingly, the report indicates that human-induced warming has been increasing at an unprecedented rate of roughly 0.26°C per decade over the 2014-2023 period. This alarming rate is driven by a combination of consistently high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, equivalent to 53 billion tonnes of CO2 per year, and ongoing reductions in atmospheric aerosols that previously provided a cooling effect. Professor Piers Forster, Director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures at the University of Leeds, emphasized the gravity of the situation: \"Global temperatures are still heading in the wrong direction and faster than ever before.\" The analysis also highlights the rapidly shrinking carbon budget – the amount of CO2 that can still be emitted before committing the world to 1.5°C of global warming. According to the report, the remaining carbon budget now stands at only around 200 gigatonnes (billion tonnes), equivalent to just five years' worth of current emissions. his alarming rate is driven by a combination of consistently high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. (Photo: Getty) In 2020, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C to be between 300 and 900 gigatonnes, with a central estimate of 500. However, continued CO2 emissions and global warming have rapidly depleted this budget. The report's findings point to the urgent need for immediate and decisive action to reduce GHG emissions and limit further warming. Professor Forster emphasised, \"Rapidly reducing emissions of greenhouse gases towards net zero will limit the level of global warming we ultimately experience. At the same time, we need to build more resilient societies.\" The report's release comes as climate experts gather in Bonn to prepare for the COP29 climate conference in November, where countries will be expected to present improved climate plans (Nationally Determined Contributions) to cut emissions and adapt to climate impacts. Accompanying the report is an open data, open science platform – the Climate Change Tracker's Indicators of Global Climate Change dashboard – which provides easy access to updated information on key climate indicators. This transparency aims to bridge the \"information gap\" created by the IPCC's major assessments, which occur only every five to seven years. As the world grapples with the escalating impacts of climate change , this report serves as a stark reminder of the urgency to act swiftly and decisively to mitigate further warming and build resilience against the inevitable consequences of a rapidly changing climate."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story As the world grapples with the impact of extreme weather events worsened by human-induced climate change, some good stories offer a ray of hope. Big corporations and companies are leading the way in bridging the gap between commerce, biodiversity and the environment. One such instance comes from Karnataka, where WeWork India, an aggregator that provides a global network of workspaces, has undertaken a multifaceted approach to address critical environmental issues at Tarahunise Lake. The project encompasses efforts to combat soil erosion, clean up surrounding areas, and increase awareness about waste management and water conservation. Recognizing the importance of community engagement, the company facilitated training sessions conducted by experts from 'Friends of Lake' and the 'Foundation of Environmental Monitoring.' These sessions have empowered the local community to conduct water quality testing, enhancing their capacity to monitor and protect the lake's water quality effectively. Beyond the lake restoration efforts, they have also devised skill development programs for women in the village to provide valuable opportunities for women to acquire new skills and contribute to the community's overall well-being. The company has undertaken various initiatives to protect the lake's bunds from erosion, improve road safety near the lake, and maintain cleanliness in the surrounding areas. The installation of fences, litter bins, and community bins has further prevented pollution and enhanced the lake's visual appeal. Lodha, India's leading real estate developer has announced the accomplishment of carbon neutrality in its operations - scope 1 and 2 emissions. This marks a significant milestone in the developer’s journey towards becoming a net-zero carbon company by 2050, maximising the sector’s contribution to India’s 2070 net-zero target. Over the past five years, Lodha reduced its scope 1 and 2 emissions by 82%. This was primarily made possible by transitioning to renewable energy sources for construction activities and owned assets, with an increase in the share of renewable electricity from less than 1% to ~83% in its overall electricity consumption between FY20-24. Cairn Oil & Gas, part of Vedanta Group and India’s leading private oil and gas exploration and production company is also pushing to become carbon neutral by 2030. With the World Environment Day's theme focusing on land restoration, halting desertification, and building drought resilience, Cairn has pushed for biodiversity conservation and nature restoration efforts across Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, and Gujarat. Cairn aims to plant 2 million trees by 2030, significantly contributing to carbon sequestration and habitat creation. In Andhra Pradesh, the Ravva region has been revitalised into a vibrant wetland, boasting 86 acres of thriving mangroves, enhancing both biodiversity and ecosystem services. In Barmer, Rajasthan, Cairn has planted 0.2 million trees across 988 acres of forest land and is reviving the Khejari (Prosopis Cineraria) with 15,000 plants, strengthening the Thar ecosystem, with the overall greenbelt in Rajasthan now spanning 1,600 acres. Along the Gujarat coast, 372 acres have been transformed into mangrove forests, boosting coastal resilience and supporting marine biodiversity. Through these initiatives, Cairn is making significant strides in restoring natural habitats and building resilience against environmental challenges."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In a dire warning about the rapidly escalating climate crisis, the United Nations has sounded the alarm over a \"shocking\" new milestone - the planet has endured an unprecedented 12 consecutive months of record-breaking heat. According to data from the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service, every month from June 2023 to May 2024 was the hottest such month on record globally. The average global temperature for this 12-month period was a staggering 1.63°C (2.9°F) above pre-industrial levels. Addressing these alarming findings, UN Secretary-General Ant³nio Guterres emphasised the urgency of immediate action to reverse course and stabilize the climate system. \"We need an exit ramp off the highway to climate hell,\" Guterres declared in a speech marking World Environment Day. \"The battle for 1.5 degrees will be won or lost in the 2020s.\" A man transports an air cooler on a motorcycle during a heat wave in Ahmedabad. (Photo: Reuters) The UN's World Meteorological Organization (WMO) now estimates an 80% chance that at least one of the next five years will temporarily exceed the critical 1.5°C warming threshold, beyond which scientists warn of increasingly severe and irreversible impacts. Guterres placed much of the blame squarely on the fossil fuel industry, accusing \"the Godfathers of climate chaos\" of raking in record profits while deceiving the public and sowing doubt about climate change. \"The fossil fuel industry rake in record profits and feast off trillions in taxpayer-funded subsidies,\" he said, urging a 30% cut in global fossil fuel production and use by 2030. In a bold move, the UN chief called on every country to ban advertising from fossil fuel companies, similar to restrictions on tobacco advertising due to its harmful effects on human health. At least one of the next five years will temporarily exceed the critical 1.5°C warming. (Photo: PTI) Despite global agreements and the rapid expansion of renewable energy, carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels hit a record high last year. The latest climate data show the world is \"way off track\" from the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C, according to the WMO's Ko Barrett. \"We must urgently do more to cut greenhouse gas emissions, or we will pay an increasingly heavy price in terms of trillions of dollars in economic costs, millions of lives affected by more extreme weather, and extensive damage to the environment and biodiversity,\" Barrett warned. As the world grapples with the escalating impacts of climate change, from deadly heatwaves to destructive storms , the UN's message is clear: urgent and unprecedented action is needed to avert a catastrophic future."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story As global leaders gather in Bonn for crucial climate talks, a recent report from Christian Aid reveals that extreme weather events linked to climate change have caused at least $41 billion in damage in the six months since COP28. The report highlights the significant economic and human toll of these events, underscoring the urgent need for increased climate action and support for affected countries. The report focuses on four of the most devastating extreme weather events scientifically attributed to climate change since COP28: floods in southern Brazil, Southwest Asia, and East Africa, and extreme heat waves across large parts of Asia. These events have impacted millions of people, resulting in at least 2,539 deaths, a number likely underestimated. Most climate-vulnerable countries fall into low-income groups. (Photo: AFP) In Asia, the recent heat waves have exacerbated humanitarian crises for displaced Palestinians in Gaza and Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, led to widespread school closures in South and Southeast Asia, and reduced crop yields across many countries. The economic repercussions are expected to include higher inflation and slowed economic growth in affected regions. Similarly, deadly floods in Brazil, South and Southwest Asia, and East Africa have destroyed homes, schools, and health centers, damaged water and sanitation facilities, worsened waterborne diseases, and devastated farmland. As the Bonn climate talks continue, there is a pressing call for wealthy nations, responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions, to increase funding for the Loss and Damage fund. This fund aims to assist countries most affected by climate change , and support efforts in adaptation, mitigation, and energy transition. Christian Aid stresses that the reported $41 billion in damage is likely an underestimate, as it only includes insured losses and economic losses from specific regions and events. The urgency of the situation is evident in the experiences of countries like Bangladesh, recently struck by Cyclone Remal, which caused widespread destruction and displacement. Nushrat Chowdhury, Climate Justice Advisor at Christian Aid Bangladesh, highlighted the devastating impact of such events: \"Last week my country of Bangladesh was struck by Cyclone Remal , killing people and wrecking livelihoods. More than 150,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed. This is the kind of climate chaos we've been experiencing this year.\" In April and May, Brazil faced its worst floods on record, displacing 600,000 people and affecting 3.2 million. The floods are estimated to reduce Brazil's GDP by $7 billion this year. In Southwest Asia, unprecedented rainfall killed at least 214 people and caused significant damage in the United Arab Emirates, where a year's worth of rain fell in just 24 hours. Many of the most climate-vulnerable countries are lower-income nations that have historically contributed the least to global greenhouse gas emissions. The United Nations established a Loss and Damage fund to support these countries, but current contributions fall far short of the estimated $290-580 billion needed by 2030. The 60th Bonn Climate Conference aims to operationalize the Loss and Damage fund, urging wealthy nations to fulfill their commitments and help the world cope with ongoing and future climate disasters."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story While several parts of the world including India reel under heatwaves, worsened by the El Nino phenomenon, oceans are not untouched. Analysis of the dataset has revealed how ocean surface heights continue to rise at faster and faster rates. The global average sea level increased by 0.76 centimetres in just a year between 2022 and 2023, which experts call a relatively larger jump. The jump is being attributed to a warming climate and the development of a strong El Nino. Nasa’s analysis, based on over 30 years of satellite observations starting with 1992 reveals a significant rise in global sea levels. Sea levels around the world are rising as a result of human-caused global warming. Overall, global sea levels have risen about 10 centimeters from 1993 to 2023. #WorldOceansDay https://t.co/qqRNzm91IA pic.twitter.com/sboKnGc4yf — NASA Climate (@NASAClimate) June 8, 2024 The latest data from the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich mission, launched in November 2020, shows an increase of approximately 4 9.4 centimetres since 1993. This rise has accelerated from 0.18 centimetres per year in 1993 to 0.42 centimetres per year currently. Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director of Nasa's sea level change team, predicts an additional 20 centimetres rise by 2050, doubling the change of the past century and increasing global flood impacts. Sea levels fluctuate due to seasonal climate phenomena like La Nina and El Nino. Researchers use radar altimeters to measure sea level. (Photo:AFP) La Nina, with cooler Pacific waters, reduces sea levels by shifting rain from the ocean to land. Conversely, El Nino, with warmer Pacific waters, raises sea levels by returning more rain to the ocean. These fluctuations are temporary but overlaid on a long-term trend of rising sea levels due to global warming. Researchers use radar altimeters to measure sea level, bouncing microwave signals off the ocean surface and refining their data with tide gauges and satellite measurements. This detailed record, enhanced by international cooperation and technological advances, helps scientists understand global sea level changes, combining data on ocean temperature, ice loss, and land movement for comprehensive insights."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story As parts of India continue to reel under the impact of severe heatwave in June continuing from last month, Nasa scientists have revealed that May 2024 was the hottest May on record, marking an unprecedented full year of record-high monthly temperatures globally. According to researchers from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), average global temperatures for the past 12 months hit new highs for each respective month – an unparalleled streak. \"It's clear we are facing a climate crisis,\" stated NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"Communities across America — like Arizona, California, Nevada — and communities across the globe are feeling first-hand extreme heat in unprecedented numbers. NASA and the Biden-Harris Administration recognise the urgency of protecting our home planet. We are providing critical climate data to better lives and livelihoods, and benefit all humanity.\" This visualization shows monthly global surface temperatures from 1880 to May 2024. (Photo: Nasa) This run of record temperatures aligns with a long-term warming trend driven primarily by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. The trend has become evident over the past four decades, with the last 10 consecutive years being the warmest since record-keeping began in the late 19th century. Before this 12-month streak, the previous longest streak of record monthly temperatures lasted seven months between 2015 and 2016. \"We're experiencing more hot days, more hot months, more hot years,\" said Kate Calvin, NASA's chief scientist and senior climate advisor. \"We know that these increases in temperature are driven by our greenhouse gas emissions and are impacting people and ecosystems around the world.\" Natural phenomena like El Niño and La Nina, which warm and cool the tropical Pacific Ocean, can contribute to year-to-year variability. (Photo: AFP) In NASA's analysis, a temperature baseline is defined by several decades or more, typically 30 years. The average global temperature over the past 12 months was 2.34 degrees Fahrenheit (1.30 degrees Celsius) above the 20th century baseline (1951 to 1980). This is slightly over the 2.69 degree Fahrenheit (1.5 degree Celsius) level with respect to the late 19th century average. NASA scientists gather data from tens of thousands of meteorological stations on land and instruments on ships and buoys to calculate Earth's global temperature . This raw data is analyzed using methods that account for factors like the varied spacing of temperature stations and urban heating effects. Natural phenomena like El Niño and La Nina , which warm and cool the tropical Pacific Ocean, can contribute to year-to-year variability in global temperatures. The strong El Niño that began in spring 2023 helped fuel last year's extreme summer and fall heat. As of May 2024, NOAA projected a 49% chance of La Nina developing between June and August, and a 69% chance between July and September. A La Niña event could partially suppress average global temperatures this year by cooling the tropical Pacific. A sluggish southwest monsoon on Wednesday covered large parts of Maharashtra, awaiting a fresh pulse to march across central and northern India, which continued to reel under intense heat conditions. Heatwave conditions were observed on Wednesday in most parts of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand; in many parts of north Rajasthan; in some parts of Himachal Pradesh, south Bihar, north Odisha and in isolated pockets of Gangetic West Bengal. Severe heatwave conditions were also observed in isolated pockets of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In a concerning discovery, a new study from Oregon State University (OSU) has revealed that gray whales spending their summers feeding in the shallow waters off the Pacific Northwest coast have undergone a significant decline in body length since around the year 2000. This reduction in size could have major consequences for the health and reproductive success of these whales, while also serving as an alarming indicator of potential issues within their marine food web. The study, published in the journal Global Change Biology , focused on the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG), a subset of approximately 200 gray whales within the larger Eastern North Pacific population. This subgroup remains closer to shore along the Oregon coast, feeding in warmer, shallower waters compared to the Arctic seas frequented by most gray whales. Smaller whale calves may struggle to survive independently after weaning. (Photo: OSU) Researchers from OSU's Marine Mammal Institute and the Geospatial Ecology of Marine Megafauna (GEMM) Lab analyzed drone images of 130 individual PCFG whales from 2016 to 2022, with known or estimated ages. The findings were startling: a full-grown gray whale born in 2020 is expected to reach an adult body length 1.65 meters (about 5 feet, 5 inches) shorter than a whale born before 2000. For PCFG gray whales that typically grow to 38-41 feet at maturity, this represents a loss of over 13% of their total length. \"In general, size is critical for animals,\" said lead author Enrico Pirotta from the University of St. Andrews. \"It affects their behavior, physiology, life history, and has cascading effects for the animals and their community.\" Smaller whale calves may struggle to survive independently after weaning, while adults could face challenges in allocating sufficient energy for reproduction and maintaining population growth. Additionally, scarring from boat strikes and fishing gear entanglements raises concerns about the resilience of smaller whales with lower energy reserves. This could be an early warning sign that the abundance of this population is starting to decline. (Photo: OSU) The study also examined the balance between \"upwelling\" and \"relaxation\" cycles in the ocean, which regulate food availability for these whales. Changes in this balance, potentially driven by climate change's impact on wind patterns and water temperatures, could disrupt the ecosystem's ability to produce enough prey to support the whales' large size. \"This could be an early warning sign that the abundance of this population is starting to decline, or is not healthy,\" said co-author K.C. Bierlich from OSU's Marine Mammal Institute. \"And whales are considered ecosystem sentinels, so if the whale population isn't doing well, that might say a lot about the environment itself.\" As researchers continue to investigate the causes and consequences of this decline, they plan to examine environmental drivers contributing to changes in the whales' body condition during their ongoing field studies of the PCFG subgroup. This alarming trend highlights the urgent need for further research and potential interventions to mitigate the impacts of climate change and other human activities on these magnificent marine mammals and their ecosystems."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In an effort to combat the global plastic pollution crisis, researchers at Shiv Nadar University have pioneered an innovative solution – developing sustainable polymers derived from industrial waste. Professor Bimlesh Lochab and Dr Sangeeta Sahu from the Department of Chemistry have introduced a novel category of waste-derived polymers with the ambitious aim of achieving carbon neutrality. By harnessing elemental sulfur from petroleum refining industries and cardanol extracted from cashew nut industry waste as raw materials, these polymers offer a sustainable alternative to conventional petrochemical-based plastics. Remarkably, their synthesis requires minimal technical complexity, making it easier to adopt across various industries. The findings have been published in the ACS Journal. The team said that these polymers belong to the emerging class of vitrimers, characterised by their ability to be reshaped and reused without disposal, similar to the regenerative properties observed in human skin. 2356581 They showcase the ability to self-heal when exposed to specific temperatures, mimicking temperature-responsive wound healing processes. Guided by the principles of green chemistry, the research team envisions a myriad of applications for these waste-derived polymers, ranging from flexible coatings to robust adhesives and flame-resistant materials for battery technology. The hallmark attributes of the developed cardanol benzoxazine-sulfur polymer—Recycling, Reprocessing, Self-Healing, and Shape Recovery (R2S2)—underscore its versatility and transformative potential across diverse industries. Notably, its rebondable adhesive properties, impressive load-bearing capacity, and s hape recovery highlight the revolutionary impact these polymers could have in addressing sustainability challenges. \"The material demonstrates excellent adhesion to metal surfaces, such as aluminium-aluminium, steel-steel, and aluminium-steel hybrid substrates, with remarkable strength,\" Dr Bimlesh Lochab said. Upon application and subsequent use of the respective adhesive, these metal substrates are retrieved undamaged, minimizing waste and enhancing reuse potential. Embracing Innovation for a Sustainable Future Professor Lochab pointed to the urgency of embracing innovation and reimagining traditional approaches to meet the evolving needs of society. By investing in sustainable solutions and fostering collaboration among academia, industry, and policymakers, we can chart a course towards a more resilient and eco-friendly future."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Several parts of India are in the throes of one of the worst bouts of heatwave as temperatures soar in several states, breaking records. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued red alerts in Delhi and several parts of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana for the day as the mercury rises worsened by gusty winds. With people awaiting monsoons more than ever, there is a section on social media which attributes the conditions to the recent solar storm that hit Earth. However, the reality can not be more far from the truth. A brutal heat wave swept Delhi, with the maximum temperature soaring to 45.2 degrees Celsius on Monday even as the weather office predicted some relief from the scorching heat from June 19. The threshold for a heat wave is met when the maximum temperature of a weather station reaches at least 40 degrees Celsius in the plains, 37 degrees in the coastal areas, and 30 degrees in the hilly regions, and the departure from normal is at least 4.5 notches. The national capital was on a 'red' alert, which will remain in force on Tuesday, with the maximum temperature expected to hit 45 degrees Celsius. Heatwave to severe heatwave conditions were recorded at most places in Delhi. (Photo: PTI) Heatwave to severe heatwave conditions were recorded at most places in Delhi, with the Safdarjung observatory, the primary weather station of the national capital, registering a high of 45.2 degrees Celsius, 6.4 notches above the season's average. Celsius, which was 9.5 notches above normal for the season, while Una in Himachal Pradesh recorded 44 degrees -- 6.7 notches above average. In Jammu and Kashmir, Katra recorded a maximum temperature of 40.8 degrees Celsius, which was 5.7 notches above normal, while the mercury touched a high of 44.3 degrees in Jammu. The Sun is going through a period of maxima, which is characterised by intense activity, and Earth experienced it in the early weeks of Ma y when an intense solar storm barrelled through the planet. The series of coronal mass ejections, the most powerful eruptions from the Sun, struck Earth. This triggered a series of auroras, seen as far as Ladakh in India, with global space agencies and scientists on alert in a bid to save assets outside the planet. The solar storm came from one of the biggest sunspots seen on the Sun in recent history. However, the solar storm did not trigger the heatwave experienced not just in India but in other parts of the world. The solar storm was solely responsible for auroras and radio blackouts over the Pacific and some parts of the world. Solar storms can be responsible for inducing electric currents in power lines, which can overload transformers and other critical infrastructure, potentially causing blackouts. The charged particles from the Sun can damage satellite electronics and solar panels. High-frequency radio waves and GPS signals can be disrupted, affecting communication and navigation systems. Meanwhile, Earth's atmosphere can also expand slightly due to heating from a solar storm, increasing drag on satellites in low Earth orbit and potentially altering their orbits. But they are not responsible for the heatwave. A coronal mass ejection from the Sun. (Photo: Getty) The heatwave crippling parts of India is solely due to human-induced climate change fuelled by emissions and global warming. The United Nations-led Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its sixth assessment report found that human influence has likely increased the chance of compound extreme events since the 1950s, including the frequency of concurrent heatwaves and droughts on the global scale. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has concluded that there is an 80 per cent likelihood that the annual average global temperature will temporarily exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels for at least one of the next five years. The global mean near-surface temperature for each year between 2024 and 2028 is predicted to be between 1.1°C and 1.9°C higher than the 1850-1900 baseline. \"We are playing Russian roulette with our planet. We need an exit ramp off the highway to climate hell, UN Secretary-General Ant³nio Guterres has warned."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 10 May, 2024 If you have invested in the 'Planet of the Apes' franchise, then you will be curious to know how the latest film, 'Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes', plays out. At the onset, you get this feeling of missing Andy Serkis’s Caesar, who was the soul of the series. Serkis, who is a master of sliding under any costume, human or animal, deserves every possible award for playing Caesar. Wes Ball’s 'Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes' jumps ahead in timeline to a few centuries, almost 300 years ahead, to introduce us to Noa (Owen Teague), whose tribe falls under attack from masked chimps and apes. Noa doesn’t have the leadership skills of Caesar or even know of his legacy. As he journeys ahead in an effort to come up with a plan to save and protect his family and friends, he comes across a human nicknamed Nova (Freya Allen). Noa’s nemesis is the self-proclaimed leader of the ape society called Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand). However, sharing names with Caesar doesn’t guarantee that he is able to walk in his footsteps. Proximus wants everyone to tow his line and there is no space for anyone else to exercise any authority. The film then plays out various themes of man vs ape against the backdrop of underlying themes such as family ties and community. Take a look at th trailer of the film: While the previous ape films focussed more on giving every man vs ape confrontation a reason and meaning. In the latest installment, the effort feels a bit superficial. The second half of the film gets a bit weary. But what rescues Kingdom from being dismissed as a failure in the franchise is the solid first half and the way the apes look and move. Clearly, the makers have polished every frame and gone all out to make these apes look utterly real and believable. Every emotion, be it rage, worry, fear, is painted beautifully in every frame. Teague as Noa is a worthy successor to Serkis. He really makes the film superior with his moves and dialogue delivery. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is a worthy choice if you want to enjoy the franchise."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 16 May, 2024 Director Vipin Das' 2022 film, 'Jaya Jaya Jaya Hey', was a breath of fresh air. The Basil Joseph and Darshana Rajendran-starrer presented a thoughtful black comedy. Now, the director has teamed up with Prithviraj Sukumaran and Basil Joseph for 'Guruvayoor Ambalanadayil', another comedy-drama set around a wedding. Will it live up to 'Jaya Jaya Jaya Hey'? Let's find out! Vinu Ramachandran (Basil Joseph), working in the Middle East, is engaged to Anjali (Anaswara Rajan). It has been five years since his breakup with Parvathy (Nikhila Vimal), yet he still hasn't moved on. His brother-in-law Anand (played by Prithviraj Sukumaran), who is also a friend and confidant, helps him overcome his feelings. However, Anand is also not leading a perfectly happy life as he is temporarily separated from his wife. And this time, Vinu takes it upon himself to bring some happiness into Anand's life. But, things go haywire when Vinu and Anand meet in person as there's another person who connects them both. This causes a rift in their relationship and whether Vinu goes ahead with his wedding to Anjali or not forms the story. Just as the trailer promised, Vipin Das' ''Guruvayoor Ambalanadayil' has a distinct humour which the audience will get used to in the first half an hour. As we get warmed up to Vinu and Anand, we are left wanting more of their conversation, which will leave you laughing. Vinu and Anand's conversations are so organic and hilarious that they make up for a spectacular first half. The director builds up the story in a brilliant fashion with all the twists and turns coming through at perfect intervals. Here's the trailer: The film's second half is what brings down 'Guruvayoor Ambalanadayil' after its perfectly crafted first half. The conflict following the intermission becomes wafer-thin. And the filmmaker introduces multiple characters leading up to a chaotic end, which is the wedding of Vinu and Anjali. While the sequence is executed tastefully, it fails to make a significant impact, partly due to the repetitive comedy and some unfunny sequences that fall short of the first half's standard. It is Basil Joseph who plays the underconfident hero, shouldering this movie. His minute expressions effortlessly propel the story forward. Additionally, it's refreshing to see Prithviraj Sukumaran in a comedic role, which works to some extent. While Nikhila Vimal's character is integral to the story, she is moved like a pawn rather than possessing solid agency. Anaswara Rajan doesn't have much to do in the film, as the focus remains on Vinu and Anand, but her performance is adequate. The two songs, composed by Ankit Menon, act as a speed breaker in an already crisp movie. 'Guruvayoor Ambalanadayil' is a passable entertainer that has several moments that will have you laughing along with some shortcomings."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 17 May, 2024 There's a scene in 'Kartam Bhugtam' where a character is waiting to catch the latest episode of 'Crime Patrol'. If you are a fan of shows like that or 'Savdhaan India', the latest release will be quite a predictable offering for you. With an old-school storyline and treatment, it will make you reminisce about those satellite films you watched during the summer in the 90s. While the film falters in maintaining consistent engagement and surprises, the performances of Shreyas Talpade and Vijay Raaz make it a watchable experience. Directed by 'Kaal' and 'Luck' fame Soham Shah, the thriller with a backdrop of astrology and superstition, also stars Madhoo and Aksha Pardasany. It revolves around an NRI Dev (Talpade), who comes back from New Zealand to sell off his father's property. While trotting around the city with his childhood friend, he meets an astrologer, Anna (Vijay Raaz), and gets completely beguiled by him. Anna not only helps Dev sort out his property woes but entangles him in his world and even makes him part of his family. His wife (Madhoo) treats him like a son and son Sameer sees an elder brother in him. The way Dev starts trusting Anna blindly and following his instructions - some absurd ones - leaves you quite uncomfortable. Be it a scene where he aggressively forces the bank official to give him a bank account number with a total of seven or running through stores to find a shirt in a particular shade is bizarre. It also makes you sigh at how a human brain can be manipulated out of plain fear. The film beautifully highlights how vulnerability seeks relief in odd places and clutches at the smallest hint of hope. Dev represents the aam janta , who put their beliefs in godmen, saints, or astrologers and consider them their only means to triumph. Here's the trailer: As already mentioned, Shreyas Talpade and Vijay Raaz carry the film on their shoulders and manage to hold your attention. Both of them get to tap on a very different avatar after the interval, where the real fun begins (not sharing spoilers). While Madhoo also gets to perform two varied personalities, it doesn't have as much impact as we expected. However, it's heartening to see her back on screen, and we hope makers give her better roles. Aksha Pardasany, who stood out in 'Jamtara', is sincere in what her role demands. Soham Shah shone as a filmmaker with his last two nail-biting dramas, but 'Kartam Bhugtam' is a shaky delivery. There are moments when you start getting involved in the plot, but it fails to hold you for too long. The twists and turns are fairly designed but are too predictable for you to enjoy. Films in this genre should either end with you chuckling or being frozen in your seats in shock, but the climax here fails to evoke any strong emotions. The music is quite forgettable and none of the songs have been designed well. The title track is quite haunting, and not in a good sense, with the same line ' kartam bhugtam ' being played in loops. Also, the background music is too loud at some moments, especially when Vijay Raaz is up to his sorcery. It's an old-school belief that these scary sounds will invoke mystery or fear amongst audiences. However, times have changed and subtlety is the keyword. The messaging of karma or 'what you sow is what you get' or 'what goes around comes around' is also rubbed on the face multiple times, and even in multiple languages. That said, 'Kartam Bhugtam' would probably find more takers on the satellite than in theatres or OTT. 2.5 out of 5 stars for 'Kartam Bhugtam'."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 17 May, 2024 ‘The Garfield Movie’ brings back the humour of Jim Davis’ comic strip and late 80s-90s TV show, ‘Garfield and Friends’. Times have changed, but Garfield remains relatable. He hates Monday, loves eating and has a peculiar sense of humour. Director Mark Dindal attempts to adapt this into a film, but does this work in this world where Gen X and Gen Z dominate the pop lingo? In this new Garfield movie, you see him reunite with his long-lost father, a scruffy street cat Vic, who draws him into an adventurous ride, which is a high-stakes heist. So, together, Garfield, his dad and Odie join hands with a few new additional characters who perfectly fit the shoes of characters like Norman. The fun part of ‘The Garfield Movie’ is that it remains true to the characters and the time it comes from, thereby invoking a lot of nostalgia. The highlight of the film continues to be the unruly chemistry between Garfield and his dad. All the fun is amplified with a background score that matches the mood of the scene and top-class animation. The villains and antagonists are designed in a way to provide perfect laughs, and you don’t want to miss it. Here's the trailer: However, the film doesn’t move on from the yesteryear comedy pattern which might not land in today’s time. While scenes involving violent banter between Garfield and his dad might look funny in the late 80s, today, it might not really pass the ‘vibe’ check for the younger generation. Chris Pratt as Garfield is so enjoyable. He has a peculiar sense of humour himself, and it translates well with the voice of Garfield. Alongside him, you have the likes of Samuel L Jackson, Hannah Waddingham, Ving Rhames, Nicholas Hoult, Cecily Strong, Harvey Guillén, Brett Goldstein, Bowen Yang, and Snoop Dogg giving voice to pivotal roles. ‘Garfield The Movie’ is overall quite a laughter riot. Watch it with a sense of abandonment to have maximum fun. The film is currently in theatres. 3.5 out of 5 stars for 'The Garfield Movie'."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 23 May, 2024 Malayalam superstar Mammootty has been in impeccable form over the past two years. After a brilliant performance in 'Bramayugam', he is back with 'Turbo', which will see him in a complete mass avatar. Will Mammootty's association with director Vysakh help him continue his streak or will this be a dent? Let's find out! Turbo Jose (Mammootty), is a jeep driver, who gets into fights in his village at the slightest provocation. Youngsters in his village look forward to his fight at a festival. When his friend Jerry (Shabareesh Varma) gets injured in the fight, he learns that the enemy gang targeted him as he fell in love with Indhulekha (Anjana Jayaprakash). Jose goes to Indhu's house and brings her (with her consent) to Jerry's house, only to be blown away by him. This lands Indhu and Jerry in trouble and the story shifts to Chennai. Jerry and Indhu, who work at different banks, are still quarrelling as lovers. However, Jerry is also dealing with a bigger enemy as he learns about a big scam carried out by Vetrivel Shanmuga Sundaram (Raj B Shetty). Will Jerry be able to expose him? What happens to his relationship with Indhu? How will Jose help them? The answers to these questions are answered over two and a half hours. Here's the trailer: Written by Midhun Manuel Thomas, 'Turbo' is directed by Vysakh. Going by the trailer, 'Turbo' is a no-holds-barred commercial entertainer about a brash man who beats everyone to pulp. Mammootty's Jose is not-so-serious, but a vulnerable guy, who is going through PTSD after a childhood incident. And then you put him against Raj B Shetty's Vetrivel Shanmuga Sundaram, who is a formulaic psycho villain who takes pleasure in killing people. 'Turbo' has many theatrical moments, but they are quite predictable. What makes it interesting is Mammootty's charm and the film's technical brilliance. Be it the camera work by Vishnu Sarma or the music by Christo Xavier, they elevate the ordinary moments and make you cheer for Mammootty. The mass masala entertainer also has a bunch of twists and turns, especially in the climax, that make things intriguing. Wait for the climax voice-over, which hints at a sequel featuring the two best actors in the country. 'Turbo' is Mammootty's show all the way. The show also deals with how the police and political system are corrupted and how men with money can easily exploit the system. The story that is constructed around this issue is relevant and makes you want to know how the creator has dealt with it. The high-octane fights in 'Turbo' are performed and filmed well. It is Mammootty's charm and such quirks that made 'Turbo' work to an extent. It is fun to see Mammootty get back to commercial entertainer after a long time and he has lived the role with perfection. Anjana Jayaprakash has a solid role, which she has portrayed with ease. Raj B Shetty plays a cliched villain. But, his performance made him a perfect adversary for Mammootty. The actor who played Mammootty's mother in the film gives much-needed comedy relief to the story. PS: Watch out for the scene where she is watching 'Avengers' at a crucial time. 'Turbo' is a predictable action drama with a few quirks in the bag that make it a watchable affair."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 24 May, 2024 Director George Miller first thought of ‘Fury Road’ in 1987, and it is almost surreal that the franchise still continues to give you an adrenaline rush. Returning as the director and writer for ‘Furiosa,’ eight years after the fantastically-mounted ‘Fury Road', Miller’s new film focusses on showing the journey of Furiosa (powerfully played by Charlize Theron in the 2015 film). Furiosa [Anya Taylor-Joy] is robbed of her life from the Green Place of Many Mothers when she was young. She is held captive by a biker horde led by the warlord Dementus [Chris Hemsworth] only to become a gigantic and fearsome warrior in a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland. But her memories of Green Place and young Furiosa [Alyla Browne] shaped her into becoming the ‘Fury Road’ Furiosa, who leaves a towering impression when we first meet her. In this prequel, Furiosa chronicles her struggle to make her way home as Dementus goes up against Immortan Joe [Tom Burke] and his Citadel, which still has food and water in abundance. While this is supposed to be Furiosa’s story, we mostly see it through Dementus’ prism. The young Furiosa hardly speaks but is quite a quick learner, adapting to challenges, and finds a way to survive amongst her captivators. Often, Miller almost ends up treating Furiosa as a more secondary character than others. The Furiosa that we met in 2015 hardly has anything to do here, except to step up and take charge when strong men around her fail to get the job done. Taylor-Joy commands those scenes with an easy flair, no doubt, but it is also just a stark reminder of how much of an impact her character made in ‘Fury Road’, reigning through the desert landscape, operating, and taking charge with one arm. Here's the trailer: Chris, as Dementus, with his caricaturish nose prosthetics, is hilarious and charming. He follows Miller’s vision at best and, together with Taylor-Joy, they deliver a solid performance. Chris' Dementus is ruthless but also someone who exhibits childish behaviour. While the storyline might seem disjointed at times with several flashbacks, it is the action sequences that really pump you up. No one better than Miller to make us shift on our seats and perhaps lean over a bit to truly absorb the action sequences, particularly a well-crafted chase sequence. Edited by Margaret Sixel and Eliot Knapman, the action scenes, the chase sequences, the overall sound effects and guitar riffs, just make it an experience worth every dime. Miller promises you a heart-pounding experience with the action compensating for the lack of heart that this prequel has, compared to his previous offering. ‘Furiosa’ is fun, and enthralling at best, but do not expect ‘Fury Road’, because this one misses the mark a tad bit. 3.5 out of 5 stars for 'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga'."

His new film, ‘Bhaiyya Ji’, however, feels like Bhiku Mhatre [from Satya] has been unleashed and Bajpayee took this up as his vacation project to enjoy outlandish action. Bhaiyya Ji, aka Ram Charan [played by Bajpayee], is a former vigilante who takes the oath of non-violence after losing his father to a gang war. However, after his younger ‘step’ brother, played by Jatin Goswani, is murdered by an arrogant father-son duo in Delhi, he reclaims his title and returns to his violent ways. In all fairness, it does seem like Manoj Bajpayee had lots of fun performing over-the-top action. The film adopts the Telugu mass hero prototype and has almost the same tone. Be it the treatment, the over-the-top dialogues, or slow-motion shots, director Apoorv [who previously collaborated with Bajpayee on 'Banda' ] gives Bajpayee a heroic treatment. But it doesn’t land. Instead, it turns out to be so outlandish that even the most emotional scenes might crack you up. Bajpayee embraces the mediocrity of the script in all its glory. He plays Ram Charan with a sense of abandonment needed to make it believable. A lean Bajpayee is seen jumping off roofs, hitting 10 men at once, all this while recuperating from injuries. But you believe it because it’s Manoj Bajpayee. However, there can be no excuse for entry-level VFX being used in the film. The dialogues seem like they are lifted from a massy Telugu film. At one point, a person says, ‘Yeh Robinhood nahi, uska baap hai,’ and the entire theatre erupts in laughter because of the absurdity. The film actually starts with a story that seems worth investing your emotions in but loses steam almost immediately. It feels like the makers had to resort to ChatGPT to complete the draft of this film. Some of the most hilarious lines come from Vipin Sharma, who plays the corrupt cop. But none of these are enough to make you want to root for the character. It is outdated and melodramatic with no arc for redemption. ‘Bhaiyya Ji’ is now in theatres."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 31 May, 2024 Many working professionals grapple with an existential crisis almost every day, questioning if they made the right career choice. They often wonder how their life would have been if they had pursued their childhood dreams. 'Mr and Mrs Mahi' tries to explore this theme but ultimately presents an aspirational yet unrealistic account. The film, starring Rajkummar Rao and Janhvi Kapoor, was also marketed as a story about a husband and wife. But it even falls short of delivering on that promise. As for cricket, for which Janhvi trained for two years, also had just a fleeting presence. Hence, despite a rousing and romantic plot and some decent performances, Sharan Sharma's drama feels half-hearted and half-baked, leaving you unsatisfied. The film's lengthy and slow first half focusses on building the plot, showcasing how the young couple chose their parents' dreams over their passion for cricket. Rajkummar's character, Mahendra, gets ample moments to express his frustration and struggles. In contrast, Janhvi's character, Mahima, amusingly conceals her aspirations until a twist later in the film. It's rather far-fetched that a doctor would abandon her profession to pursue cricket after a random push from her husband and a scolding from her boss. Mahima's cricketing experience is limited to playing in her 'mohalla', a common activity for most Indian kids. The film unrealistically suggests that becoming a sportsperson is easy, ignoring the rigorous demands of professional sports. It's all so bizarre because neither did the makers hint at her being a child prodigy, a cricket marvel in the past, nor did she seem so unhappy with her job to change gears so swiftly. Here's the trailer: While Rajkummar and Janhvi's chemistry is convincing in the early scenes, the juvenile writing soon induces eye-rolling. Mahendra admits to being a hopeless loser, and Mahima, a qualified doctor, agrees to marry him because he's 'honest'. The couple also appears to have hardly courted, knowing little about each other, which feels so outdated in today's time. The film's most genuine moment arrives during a conversation between Mahendra and his mother, played by Zarina Wahab, who poignantly describes how fame is addictive. She points out how the current generation is in a relentless race with no finish line, leaving them forever unhappy. This scene underscores Mahendra's struggles as he desperately tries to take credit for his wife's achievements, even resorting to creating cringe-worthy Instagram Reels. Rajkummar Rao brings depth to Mahendra aka Mr Mahi, portraying a flawed character dealing with insecurity as a cricketer, brother and husband. His resentment towards his father contributes to his failure as an entrepreneur. Mahendra's desire for respect and recognition makes him deceitful, yet unapologetic - a trait more relatable today than being cinema's Mr goody-two-shoes hero. Janhvi Kapoor, as Mrs Mahi is competent in the cricket scenes but falters during emotional scenes. Her banal character feels like an extension of her roles in 'Dhadak' and 'Bawaal'. While Janhvi looks beautiful and reminiscent of mother Sridevi in some scenes, her performance still looks affected by the 'nepotism' baggage that she claims to be carrying. It's time she set herself free. Among the supporting cast, Kumud Mishra stands out as a father constantly dissatisfied with his son, though his character's arc is shaped without much meat. Zarina Wahab shines in her limited screen time. Janhvi's on-screen parents, played by Purnendu Bhattacharya and Yamini Das, also leave a mark, and we wish the makers explored the parent-children dynamic better, as it could have added depth to the screenplay. Despite director Sharan Sharma's impressive work on 'Gunjan Saxena', his latest film fails to create the same magic. The cricket sequences lack thrill and excitement, and the film's emotions are scattered, making it hard to connect with the characters. The dark undertone used in the film feel forced to invoke emotions. While the songs are pleasant to hear, they contribute little to the narrative. To wrap up, while 'Mr and Mrs Mahi' might have seemed promising on paper, the final product fails to strike the right chord. The team's earnest efforts are evident, but the film falls short of creating a lasting impact. 2.5 out of 5 stars for 'Mr and Mrs Mahi'."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 7 Jun, 2024 The ‘friendly’ cops are back. A sequel to ‘Bad Boys For Life’ and fourth in the ‘Bad Boys’ franchise, ‘Bad Boys: Ride or Die,’ is a testament that Will Smith and Martin Lawrence’s bromance is here to stay. The action-comedy serves you exactly what it promises -- an edgy, hilarious plot that makes you feel like you are a part of a ‘counter-strike’ mission yourself. Returning to exonerate Captain Conrad Howard, accused of involvement in the cartel posthumously, bad boys, aka detectives Mike Lowrey [Will Smith] and Marcus Burnett [Martin Lawrence], step up and work outside of the law on their new mission. This film, however, unlike the 2020 one, is funnier, delivering punch after punch in the most unlikely situation. Marcus has an otherworldly experience after facing an almost death-like situation and returns feeling invincible. He is unafraid of crossing the road, dancing as cars come dashing by, standing on the edge of the rooftop, almost naked, taking a bullet [okay, that could be a stretch]. But you get it. Co-written by Chris Bremner and Will Beall, the film does not try making any unnecessary statements. It is purely made for fun and for keeping your josh (spirit) high. Martin gets the wittiest lines to pull off, but it is Will’s responsibility to make things funnier with his reactions. The actors share a seamless bromance that draws you in almost immediately. The direction needs a special mention. Filmmakers Adil and Bilall use some innovative camera work to give you a slightly unique experience. Action sequences are intense yet never get overbearing. In fact, at times, you really feel like you are a part of the ‘counter-strike’ mission and playing it along with the characters. It’s predictable but doesn’t compromise on the thrill. The dialogues can sometimes seem too on your face but Martin makes it watchable with his pitch-perfect delivery. For instance, during one of the sequences, you see him 'yelling' about racism because someone accuses them of stealing: \"Oh, just because we are black, we aren’t stealing,\" he says. Honestly, if not for Martin, this might seem a little out of place, but it works. Also, his never-ending, ‘Man, I haven’t told you this before butâæ’ hit the right chord almost every time. If this is what a near-death experience does to Marcus, then we say, 'keep them coming!' With Joe Pantoliano, Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig, Paola Nºñez, Jacob Scipio, and DJ Khaled reprising their roles, the cast delivers a solid punch. New cast members include Eric Dane, Ioan Gruffudd, Rhea Seehorn, Melanie Liburd and Tiffany Haddish. The climax almost feels like you are watching a 70s Amitabh Bachchan film, and that is high praise. The runtime of almost two hours makes it quite an interesting watch. The film doesn’t overburden you with never-ending action gimmicks, but lets you engross yourself in this getaway. It is a perfect summer watch for those who are looking to have a fun time at the movies. ‘Bad Boys: Ride or Die’ will hit theatres in India on June 7."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 7 Jun, 2024 What do you say about a film where most of the audience in the theatre is busy on their phones? Blackout, starring Vikrant Massey and Sunil Grover, did start on a promising note but fell flat on its face, even before we could settle comfortably into our seats. The film is chaotic and loud, and even when sprinkled with some forced jokes, it remains unfunny. If the JioCinema film is to be described colloquially, it would be ' Kuch Bhi'! Blackout looks like a heist drama as the credits roll out, but soon it turns out to be a story of a common man, Lenny Dsouza (Massey), and how a night changes his life. There is a city-wide blackout, an accident, an unguarded treasure, a dead body to dispose of, a drunkard and two pickpockets as aides, a bitchy boss, a Byomkesh Bakshi-styled detective, a damsel in distress, betrayal from loved ones, ex-MLA up for revenge, a police officer waiting to attack, gang wars, guns and bullets, a henchman, and a lot of confusion. Isn't that just too much, not only for Lenny but also for the audience? There are times when you feel the film is an extended version of social media videos where there are absurd twists to evoke laughter. Everything that Lenny encounters goes wrong, pulling him further into a murkier mess. Earlier this year, we saw audiences enjoying slapstick comedy in Madgaon Express . In the past, we have also seen films like Delhi Belly, Kaalakaandi, and Go Goa Gone, with the same theme. The humour in Blackout, however, seems forced. While there are a few genuinely good jokes by an influencer duo, they are never highlighted. The film only manages to tickle the funny bone towards the last 10 minutes when all loose ends are tied. (Spoiler alert!) There’s a scene where Vikrant’s character shoots bullets out of a gun while SRK’s ‘Chaiyya Chaiyya’ plays out. That was the star gag of the film. Coming to performances, Vikrant Massey tries hard to play a loud Punekar. Given how he's aced most of his characters in the past, this one fails to make an impact. His portrayal as the sting operation journalist also looks unconvincing. A post shared by Vikrant Massey (@vikrantmassey) Sunil Grover's Bewda was written with Shah Rukh Khan's Pathaan and Jawan in mind. From his long hair look to his action sequence in the climax, Sunil embodies the superstar in most scenes. There's also a reference to 'Badshah' but we leave it for you to discover. The comedian plays an alcoholic street dweller with a past who is also termed 'sasta Ghalib ' for mouthing tragic poems all along. There’s a dialogue in the film where a character, amused with so many people walking into Lenny's life, says how no one would be paid in full as they would be tagged as cameos. And that seems to be the reality of Blackout. The makers got star performers like Jisshu Sengupta, Chhaya Kadam, Mouni Roy, and Anant Joshi, to play minuscule roles in the films. And that was truly heartbreaking. These actors never got a chance to bite their teeth into these poorly fleshed characters. Social media influencers Karan Sonawane and Saurabh Ghadge, who play Thik Thak, however, manage to add some light humour with their banters. The voiceover by Anil Kapoor, in his inimitable style, was also a treat to hear. The director of the film, Devang Shashin Bhavsar, struck gold with the casting, but when you have a weak script, nothing works. Also, even though the basic theme had potential, the filmmaker did a shoddy job of setting the right narrative tone and making the plot engaging. The film is all over the place with multiple characters and subplots. It never gets a chance to swim smoothly through and makes for an exhausting watch. The music by Vishal Mishra is also quite forgettable though using classic Bollywood songs at multiple junctures was a masterstroke. Those are probably the only moments when the happenings on the screen got everyone’s attention. Blackout is streaming on JioCinema."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 7 Jun, 2024 When 'Godzilla Minus One' dropped on Netflix with no big announcement or promo, it caught many, including me, by surprise. After all, this was THE Godzilla film everyone was waiting for. With a limited release worldwide, fans of the franchise were hoping that it gets a theatrical release in India. But for now, we have to make do with the OTT version and be happy! So why is 'Godzilla Minus One' such an important feature in this franchise? And what sets it apart from the other Godzilla movies? Let’s dive deep! Godzilla leads the pack when it comes to monster movies that are based on a creature. For years, Japanese filmmakers have been obsessed with this giant that is sea and land-borne, which wreaks havoc and destroys cities. The recent 'Godzilla vs Kong' universe even took this prospect to a newer level and introduced possibilities of radiation and its aftermath. But 'Minus One' is a different Godzilla film . Here's the trailer of 'Godzilla Minus One': The film doesn’t want us to only clap and jump in our seats when the monster arrives. The story is set around the end of World War II where a guilt-ridden pilot tries to give himself a second chance only to find that there is no real escape from the demons of his past. The story and writing are so sharp and at the same time create a world where we get to see a lot of what the Japanese common folk went through as a result of the war. The film won the Best Visual Effects at the Oscars 2024, and you can tell why. The makers don’t go overboard with the pyrotechnics and keep it subtle. When you see Godzilla for the first time, you are in absolute awe of him. His eyes and his moves feel more real and menacing than ever before. The fight scenes, especially the ones set in the ocean where they try and prevent the creature from coming to the shore, are terrific. Takashi Yamakazi creates an almost perfect Godzilla film that does ample justice to its 1954 beginning. At a time when the West is so heavily invested and relying on VFX in storytelling, it’s heartening to see a filmmaker balance both in a creature film that is expected to sway audiences towards visual effects. If you haven’t watched any Godzilla film before, then this is a terrific introduction to its universe and if you are a 'Kaiju' fanatic, then 'Minus One' is the perfect antidote to your Godzilla withdrawal symptoms. 5 out of 5 stars for 'Godzilla Minus One'."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 7 Jun, 2024 Director Guna Senniappan's 'Weapon' has made headlines multiple times over the past year. It was one of the first few films to use AI to de-age actor Sathyaraj. Additionally, the film's trailer intrigued many viewers, hinting at a solid action thriller revolving around the concept of superhumans. Did the film manage to hold your attention? Let's find out! 'Weapon' delves deep into the story right from the get-go. Set in the pre-Independence era, we are introduced to the concept of a super serum used by Hitler to develop super soldiers. While SNetaji Subash Chandra Bose and another freedom fighter had the opportunity to get hold of the serum, Bose dismissed the idea due to its potential consequences. After his death, the other freedom fighter got hold of the serum and fed it to his son. Meanwhile, there's DK (Rajeev Menon), who heads Black Society Division 9, which carries out assassinations and is in search of superhumans as well. Then there's Agni (Vasanth Ravi), who is an award-winning YouTuber, who researches superhumans and advocates for nature. An untoward accident in Theni brings the topic of superhumans to light. Who are these superhumans? Director Guhan Senniappan's 'Weapon' begins as an investigative thriller. We know that a massive blast occurred, and YouTuber Agni was found near the site. The NSG officials conduct an investigation regarding the explosion. Strangely, a man with a mask is brought in by the NSG to bring out the truth from Agni. While it begins as an investigative thriller, we are soon introduced to tons of sub-plots. So much so that our brain is occupied with so much information but too little time to process it. Here's the trailer: There are multiple scientific concepts - Neutrino research, cloning - to name a few peppered throughout the screenplay. Then there's another research, headed by DK, which can grow a limb or arm with a serum. These are too far-fetched and hard to believe even though the visual effects try to make up for the ambitious ideas. 'Weapon' is a perfect example of the proverb 'too my cooks spoil the broth'. In this case, it's the numerous sub-plots, narrated in a non-linear fashion, that subvert the impact. Despite decent performances from Sathyaraj and Vasanth Ravi, it is too difficult to take 'Weapon' seriously because of its far-fetched ideas. Rajeev Menon's performance is hardly effective, and the concept of the Black Society is not fully developed. They come and go as they wish, adding to the confusion with more sub-plots. Though the film is technically strong with neat visual effects, the filmmaker failed to explore the potential of the script to the fullest. Had Guhan Senniappan cut down on a few sub-plots, he would have had a vast canvas to explain the concepts in a manner that could be savoured."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 14 Jun, 2024 Tamil cinema relies on dramatic films as much as it does on commercial action extravaganza. But, seldom do a few films utilise drama to deal with sensitive topics. Director Nithilan Swaminathan's 'Maharaja' is one such revenge drama that talks about an important topic which has been relevant for many decades. Maharaja (Vijay Sethupathi) is an aged father, who lives with his daughter Jothi (Sachana Nemidas). One day, he visits Pallikaranai police station in Chennai to file a complaint about 'Lakshmi' being stolen. The cops wonder who 'Lakshmi' is only to find out that it's a rusted iron dustbin. The dustbin holds significance in Maharaja and Jothi's lives as it saved the latter during a fatal accident which claimed the life of his wife. Then we have another father, Selvam (Anurag Kashyap) who, along with his sidekick, breaks into isolated houses to steal and rape women. Maharaja's complaint isn't taken seriously, but he is willing to bribe Inspector Varadan (Natty aka Natarajan Subramanian) to find out the culprit. But, everyone knows that there's more to Lakshmi and Maharaja than meets the eye. Here's the trailer: Nithilan Swaminathan announced his arrival as a filmmaker with the critically acclaimed 'Kurangu Bommai' in 2017. With 'Maharaja', he is back with a violent revenge thriller that is well-intentional on paper. Talking about 'Maharaja' without giving spoilers is a task indeed. But, spoilers aside, 'Maharaja' exploits the non-linear story pattern to the maximum. Was it effective? Partly, yes! But, majorly underwhelming, especially in the second half where the story comes together. The first half of 'Maharaja' is all about the establishment. We get to see multiple storylines one after the other. It's disjointed and makes you scratch your head. But, it is still engaging, as you know that Vijay Sethupathi's Maharaja is up to something. It is in the second half that the plot points converge. However, the lead-up is replete with convenient writing choices, which results in a lot of assumptions. Also, while dealing with sensitive topics, there needs to be a proper understanding of where to draw the line. Even though the director might have had the best intentions, 'Maharaja' has crossed that line. It relies on orchestrated twists and violence to evoke emotions. Vijay Sethupathi lives up to the role of Maharaja, a wholesome father. His transformation scene, action sequences and performance are just perfect for the film. Anurag Kashyap, on the other hand, did not belong to the film. His lip sync issue dilutes the seriousness of the performance. Sachana Nemidas has limited screen time and has delivered it. 'Maharaja' has a lot going on. Sadly, the hits and misses are not proportional, with the latter having the upper hand. These good moments get buried under dark humour, which hardly works, and many other shortcomings."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 7 Jun, 2024 'Hit Man,' directed by the brilliant Richard Linklater, is a cinematic gem that blends humour, action, and philosophy into an unforgettable experience. Starring Glen Powell as the titular character Gary, this film explores the duality of human nature and the fluidity of identity, all the while keeping you on the edge of your seat. Gary, a psychology and philosophy professor by day, moonlights as a tech support consultant for the police. His life takes a dramatic turn when he starts working as a hitman-of-sorts for law enforcement. In this undercover role, he crosses paths with Madison, played by the talented Adria Arjona. Madison, entangled in an abusive marriage, wants her husband Ray out of the picture. When Gary, disguised as the suave Ron, meets her, he finds himself drawn to her plight and beauty. Instead of taking out her husband, he encourages her to change her life, sparking a romance that defies the conventions of their circumstances. Then what happens is history. Glen Powell and Adria Arjona in a still from 'Hit Man'. Richard Linklater's direction is a delight to watch. Every scene is crafted well, and the film never drags or loses momentum. Linklater, in collaboration with Glen Powell, has woven a screenplay that captivates from start to finish. Each moment is purposeful, adding depth to the narrative and keeping the audience engaged. It's a treat to watch, as the director skillfully balances the elements of drama, action, and philosophical inquiry. Glen Powell shines as Gary/Ron, delivering a performance that feels tailor-made for him. His portrayal of a man juggling multiple identities is both convincing and compelling. As the philosophical professor, Gary, Powell's nuanced delivery of complex ideas about the self is particularly engaging. His transformation into Ron, the cool and collected hitman, is equally impressive, showcasing his range as an actor. Adria Arjona, as Madison, holds her own with a captivating performance. She brings a mix of vulnerability and strength to her character, making her someone the audience roots for. While Austin Amelio's character, Jasper, isn't the quintessential antagonist, he certainly throws a wrench into Gary and Madison's burgeoning romance. His portrayal of the troublemaker adds an extra layer of tension and conflict to the story. Watch the trailer here: One of the film's most intriguing aspects is its exploration of the notion of 'self.' Gary's various identities serve as a commentary on the fluidity of human nature. His lectures on philosophy and the construct of selfhood parallel his own journey of self-discovery and transformation. As Gary evolves, so do his teachings, reflecting his inner turmoil and growth. The classroom scenes, where he is closest to his truest self, offer a window into his psyche, presenting his most vulnerable self to his students and, by extension, to the audience. Without giving too much away, the film concludes on a happy note, but it leaves viewers with plenty to ponder. It challenges the idea that humans are static beings, suggesting instead that we are capable of profound change. Gary's journey from a philosophy professor to an undercover operative and finally a lover underscores this theme beautifully. The film posits that our true, authentic self is not fixed but is something we can shape and reshape, depending on our choices and circumstances. 'Hit Man' is more than just an action-packed thriller; it's a thought-provoking exploration of identity and transformation. Richard Linklater's direction, combined with Glenn Powell's stellar performance, makes for a film that is both entertaining and intellectually stimulating. Whether you're drawn to its philosophical musings or its riveting storyline, 'Hit Man' is a cinematic experience that is not to be missed. So, buckle up and get ready for a ride that will leave you questioning the very nature of self and the endless possibilities of human change."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Release Date: 14 Jun, 2024 Watching the same basic story arcs you've seen dozens of times before in a brand-new film can still be deeply satisfying. It takes you back to the times when similar narratives left you feeling fulfilled after leaving the theatre. The catch, of course, is that the newest version has to be done well. That's what Kabir Khan's Chandu Champion is: A formulaic film (a term which is in no way an insult), with tremendous performances from Kartik Aaryan and Vijay Raaz. Its story, about an underdog athlete who gets a chance at the world stage, has been told a hundred times before. Describing it would be a cliché from start to finish. But Chandu Champion isn't about the story, it's about the hero. Murlikant Petkar, a war hero-turned-Paralympic champion, is a name only a few Indians would have heard, including myself. Inspired by KD Jadhav, the first athlete from independent India to win an individual medal in the Olympics, a young Murli carries the dream of having an Olympic gold medal around his neck one day. But he is ridiculed for harbouring such a dream. Leaving behind all odds, this little boy grows up, in a fashion that will take you back to the 80s Bollywood when the lead hero grew up while running on a railway track. And this is the point where you start to get invested in the film. Yes, it takes a while to get there. Khan follows all the tropes of underdog sports movies. There's an athlete who can't get anyone to take him seriously. He's headed into a showdown with overwhelming odds against him, but then surprises everyone by making it a real fight. His dreams take time to turn into reality, because winning early wouldn't be dramatically satisfying. Along the way, the athlete has a trainer and a distraction from a girl, and he is surrounded by other characters, whose journeys eventually become all about him. The first few minutes of the film, which take us through Murlikant's childhood in Sangli, Maharashtra, remind us of Milkha Singh's childhood as that is exactly how Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra showed us in the opening of his 2011 film 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag'. But it doesn't end there. When you watch his back-breaking training for boxing and swimming, to a degree, you see a bit of Farhan Akhtar there. Even the song 'Satyanaas' with its slapstick humour is reminiscent of the 'Hawan Karenge' song. But Chandu Champion earns its stripes through the devotion of its actors and director. Khan's (who has also co-written the film) camera reveals how much he loves the subject of his film. He steers clear of all the over-the-top 'desh ke liye mar-mitenge' type dialoguebaazi, rona-dhona and naach-gaana, the typical instruments of Hindi filmmakers to evoke bells and whistles in cinema halls. Rather, he keeps it simple. Without pushing any artistic boundaries, he delivers a mostly believable film, except a few hiccups, the major one being a peon convincing the government babus to send Petkar for the Paralympics. In all of the best senses of the words, the film is made by someone who has a knack for sports films, as we saw in his last directorial outing 83. And though he adheres to the template of sports dramas, Khan does a good job at that. He also tries to tap into the shoddy treatment of athletes, especially para-athletes by government bodies and how ignorant most Indians are to para-athletes. \"Main chandu nahi, champion hai,\" Kartik Aaryan says in the film. Through the dialogue, it seems like he's sending a message to his naysayers who couldn't see the actor beyond his Sonus, Guddus and Gogos. Kartik shows he is as capable of being a tough yet tender, dedicated and sincere athlete as he is of being a goofy lover on-screen. The actor needs to be applauded for his versatility and conviction at acing whatever comes his way, a quality missing in his contemporaries. But the moment you place him alongside a Vijay Raaz, who plays his coach, and is an actor who looks equally at home no matter where you put him, you know that difference between acting a part and the real deal. Raaz's acting prowess lies in how much he makes his characters more tactile and believable. He cries so naturally at Petkar's win in the climax, that if you are as emotional as I am, you might too end up with moist eyes. Vijay Raaz is terrific in Chandu Champion. In terms of performance, actors like Brijendra Kala, Rajpal Yadav and Bhuvan Arora, who appear briefly, also look effortless and leave an impact. Having said that, there are times when things don't fall into place. Chandu Champion has some issues. We never get to see the climax of Murlikant's final fight at the International Services Sports Meet in Tokyo in 1964. A few characters enter, creating a scope of diving deeper into Murlikant Petkar's life beyond sports, but then leave abruptly. There are gaps in the story where it feels like Khan skipped portions of Petkar's life as per convenience. Was he in a rush or was it not possible to cram the key moments of Petkar's life into two hours? Only Khan could answer. As mentioned above that being formulaic is not a problem, at least for me, until the film gets the right treatment and stays entertaining. What makes Chandu Champion worth a watch, is the way that Khan truly believes in his story and turns it into a feel-good watch. It's about heroism and realising your potential, about taking your best shot despite adversities and sticking by your dream. It sounds not only clichéd but corny and yet it involves us on a human level. So, even when we know who will have a Paralympic/Olympic medal around his neck, the scenes before the climax set us up for it so completely, so emotionally, that when it plays, we root for him. There is no high-strung melodrama, with the national anthem playing in the background like the one we watched in Mary Kom or Dangal. And for that, we applaud the makers for keeping it about the subject and not veering into jingoism."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Telling a story which is already known can be quite a risk, but ‘The Iron Claw’ really hits the ball out of the park. Directed by Sean Durkin, the film is about Von Erick and his family of professional wrestlers who are believed to be ‘cursed’. Well, not literally but figurative - cursed by the tragedy of being 'overambitious’. Set in the 1980s-1990s, the film shows how the three sons of Fritz Von Erich, the owner of a wrestling company, struggle to keep afloat and chase an immortal legacy in the highly competitive world of professional wrestling. They seek it at the personal cost of elusive happiness and family life. Yes, they remain immortal in memories, but their lives aren’t really the ‘ideal’ one. It is tragic beyond measure, to say the least. Watch the trailer here: Led by a stellar Zac Efron, who plays the older brother Kevin, the film also sees Jeremy Allen White, Harris Dickinson, Maura Tierney, Stanley Simons, Holt McCallany, and Lily James in pivotal roles. They bring measured vulnerability to the act without compromising on the not-so-glorious side of chasing a legacy. Director Durkin keeps it sombre with the story spinning around family dynamics and brotherhood amid a burning desire for ambitions. What’s interesting is how a film about professional wrestling, which is all about machismo on the surface, is quite tender and full of human emotions beneath. The production and set really teleports you to the early 1980s-90s with picturesque spots and vintage camera-like textures being used. The era is captured to the T in motion and in subtext. The film does not shy away from showing toxic masculinity for what it is. There is no glorification, only facts. In fact, you feel sorry for them in moments where you see the ‘American-caged’ dream mindset overpowering their human instincts and a hit to their mental health. The way sports is used to tell the story of their struggle is effortless and the attempt to keep it authentic can be seen. It is hard-hitting and emotional but doesn’t compromise on the entertainment quotient. There is enough action for one to feel that adrenaline rush. Amongst others, Zac as Kevin really offers a great performance. You root for Kevin more because of how Efron can portray him with sensitivity yet firmness. There is no effort to whitewash. You see him for what he is - flawed but wanting to be a good brother, pensive yet heart-wrenching. ‘The Iron Claw’ is a moving film that leaves you feeling sorrowful yet cathartic. The film is now available on Lionsgate Play."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story As India's Covid-19 crisis gets worse, it has come to light that China has quietly hardened its positions in eastern Ladakh. Top sources tell India Today TV that far from winding down winter deployments, the Chinese Army has reinforced its presence in eastern Ladakh depth areas with permanent accommodations and depots -- an aggressive stance amidst continuing talks. While the pullback by Indian and Chinese troops from the Pangong Tso sectors in February had created an atmosphere of hope for a slow but steady disengagement, the new permanent Chinese accommodations built between Kangxiwar, just north of Aksai Chin, and Rudok in Tibet's Ladakh frontier has caused alarm. Ground intelligence and imagery with the Indian security establishment has led to an assessment that has echoed through the standoff periodically: that the PLA is here for the long haul. India Today TV brings out these fresh facts on a day when Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a message of sympathy to Indian PM Narendra Modi over the Covid-19 deaths in the country, saying, \"The Chinese side stands ready to strengthen cooperation with the Indian side in fighting the pandemic and provide support and help in this regard. I believe that under the leadership of the Indian Government, the Indian people will surely prevail over the pandemic.\" ALSO READ | 3 separate brawls, 'outsider' Chinese troops & more: Most detailed account of the brutal June 15 Galwan battle Contrasting the diplomatic outreach from the Chinese government aside, the Chinese Army has quietly reinforced positions located to support the friction areas if necessary. India Today TV learns that imagery shows that China's winter deployment positions have been reinforced with permanent structures, accommodations and military buildings in a long arc through the Aksai Chin bulge, comprising depth areas from the friction points of the India-China standoff. These include Xaidulla in the southwestern part of Xinjiang Autonomous Region, a strengthened Chinese radar site at Piue which is just across from Ladakh's Chip Chap valley, and the military outpost at Kyrmmgo Traggar across the LAC from Hot Springs and Gogra Post. The 10,000 permanent Chinese troops positioned at Kangxiwar and Rudok have been reinforced with 10,000 additional temporary troops according to one intelligence estimate. \"They have disengaged, but not reduced troop strength -- a clear sign that they intend to be here for the long haul,\" a military source told India Today TV. ALSO READ | Himalayan Impasse | India-China standoff A map of the spring 2021 reinforcement has also strengthened the view that China is in no mood to dial down its aggressive posture across from the Depsang and Daulat Beg Oldie areas of northern Ladakh. India Today TV has reported on how China has slowly built up in these sectors as well. Interestingly, the depth areas of Spanggur Tso, south of the Pangong lake have also been reinforced with permanent accommodations. This is adjacent to the sector where India had obtained a tactical advantage in the Kailash Range last August, forcing China into a stalemate. While some of these needed to be abandoned as part of the February pullback, the Indian Army is understood to still hold similarly advantageous positions in other sectors at this time. The celebrated February disengagement is also revealing the reality of Chinese intent. While Chinese troops and positions have moved beyond Finger 8 in the north Pangong sector, a bulk of the forces remains in the rear areas with elements of the 4th, 6th and 11th Motorised Divisions still present in those areas. ALSO READ | 'Inflexible' China refuses to disengage at Gogra, Hot Springs in eastern Ladakh It must be said that there has been no reinforcement or strengthening of Chinese positions on the frontlines in any of the sectors, though that isn't surprising given that such a move would be seen as immediately belligerent. China's quiet but aggressive reinforcement in depth areas, fully within view of the Indian military and intelligence agencies, comes just weeks after China showed surprising inflexibility during the last round of talks on April 9, at which time it virtually outright refused to discuss any pullback from the Gogra Post and Hot Springs friction points of the standoff area. May 5 will mark one year since the military standoff began between the nuclear neighbours in eastern Ladakh, starting with a conflagration on the banks of the Pangong lake, and quickly spreading to other areas, most notably the Galwan Valley, Gogra Post and Hot Springs.

The base hospital has enough supplies for the time being and can take care of its patients but the issue has to be addressed shortly otherwise it can lead to shortages, the Army sources added. The India Army's Base Hospital Delhi Cantonment (BHDC) has reportedly deployed vehicles out of the national capital to bring jumbo oxygen cylinders on an emergency basis. The facility currently requires 125 jumbo cylinders daily. The Western Command of the Indian Army, however, clarified that there is an adequate supply of oxygen in the base hospital.

In a tweet, the Indian Army had said that at the start of the second wave, the hospital catered for 340 Covid-19 beds of which just 250 beds were oxygenated. It later expanded the capacity to 650 beds of which 450 will be oxygenated by April 30, Friday.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The abrupt transfer of the Army General who heads Delhi's Army Base Hospital has sparked speculation and raised eyebrows about why such a change of guard has been necessary at such a crucial time in the Covid fight. Major General Vasu Vardhan, Commandant of the Army Base Hospital, who is said to have only a few months to go before retirement, has been moved out and appointed 'Additional Officer' at the Army Research & Referral (R&R) hospital in Delhi. The sudden changeover was ordered on May 10 via a postings’ notification, a copy of which India Today TV has accessed. The notification also announced the outgoing Commandant's immediate replacement -- Major General SK Singh, who was the Deputy Commandant at the Army Medical Corps Centre & College in Lucknow. Major General Singh takes charge of the Army's Base Hospital as it accelerates its processes to battle the Covid crisis and other requirements of the large ex-servicemen community in Delhi-NCR. Authorities told India Today TV, \"The current Commandant has completed a tenure of more than 18 months in his current appointment. It is a routine posting carried out as part of a larger plan of HR management within the Armed Forces Medical Services.\" While postings and appointments do happen routinely, two things suggest that this transfer could be different. First, such change of guard in the middle of a high-intensity mission like the Covid fight are very rare. Secondly, the outgoing Commandant was within sight of his retirement from service. Being moved out to an 'Additional Officer' position with only a few months before retirement can be seen as an emergent action based on possible displeasure among higher ranks. The nature and context of this displeasure, if any, is not clear. Commandant of Base Hospital, Maj Gen Vasu Vardhan lost his mother yesterday. He was still helping those who needed his help even while performing last rites. A post by Lt Gen Agarwal(R) regarding this is viral on whatsapp. Heartfelt condolences And A General Salute! — Lt Gen Satish Dua (@TheSatishDua) May 9, 2021 The armed forces veteran community has been abuzz over the development for the past 24 hours with speculation on the sudden transfer growing. While the trigger for the transfer remains in the realm of guesswork, May has been a cruel month for the officer. According to a Twitter post by Lt Gen Satish Dua, former 15 Corps Commander, outgoing Commandant Major General Vasu Vardhan had lost his mother a few days before the transfer orders were issued. Earlier this month, India Today TV had reported on how the Army Base Hospital was facing a looming oxygen shortage and had been forced to take matters into its own hands."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Saddled with over 30 cases of mucormycosis (black fungus) among serving soldiers and military veterans, Delhi's two premier defence hospitals -- the Army R&R and Army Base Hospital -- are struggling without adequate supplies of the life-saving drug Amphotericin B. India Today has learnt that the two hospitals have less than half of the amount required to treat the patients at hand. An Army doctor at the Research & Referral hospital said, \"Many lives, including those of serving frontline soldiers, are at risk since the hospital is still awaiting the bare minimum consignment to fight increasing black fungus cases.\" The sudden spurt in cases is part of a wider outbreak of the rapidly intensifying and often-fatal fungal disease that has afflicted thousands of Covid patients across India, leading to the disease being officially notified under the Epidemic Act. The spread of the fungus, while still being studied, has been attributed to overuse of unsanitised oxygen equipment during the second wave, with most of the affected being diabetics or the otherwise immunocompromised. Links to the use of zinc supplements and runaway steroid prescriptions have also been known to play a part in helping the fungus infect individuals. A senior Ministry of Defence officer said the government had been apprised of the shortage, and that efforts were being made to meet the Amphotericin B requirement on priority. It is understood that word has also gone out from the hospitals to the families of the mucormycosis patients that everything is being done to ensure there is no delay in treatment or administration of drugs. But the precarious touch-and-go situation has unnerved many who serve at the hospital. An Army officer at the Army Base Hospital said, \"I'm reminded of my time on the [Siachen] glacier in the eighties, when we would wait with bated breath for every jerrycan of fuel that was dropped from a helicopter. We literally survived from jerrycan to jerrycan. It was something like what we are seeing here now.\" ALSO READ: Karnataka Congress MLA alleges discrepancy in black fungus case numbers Delhi's Army Base Hospital has been in the news recently for all the wrong reasons.

The former envoy spoke to India Today TV at length, explaining that the US official’s comments were a “display of rather crude public diplomacy of a nature that is not expected from a friendly country like the US”. “The world is not at peace. In fact, it is going to pieces. And in such situations, it is normal for everybody to try and maximise their position. We have military conflicts and hostilities going on in Ukraine but we also have a weaponisation of sorts being launched - something very unprecedented. A G20 country is being sanctioned in an unprecedented manner. Obviously, these have repercussions in an interdependent world. It is not the first time sanctions have been used as a tool. But let me tell you they have no sanctity in international law,” Syed Akbaruddin told India Today TV. Remarks made by US Deputy National Security Adviser were not in line with the diplomatic traditions, says @AkbaruddinIndia #Newstrack @ShivAroor pic.twitter.com/tRvDNIqfyA — IndiaToday (@IndiaToday) April 1, 2022 “These are used by states in the pursuit of their interests and that’s what the US is doing and some European states are doing. This is their call and they are doing it. As far as bystanders like India are concerned, we are bystanders but are affected by it. So it’s normal to have these engagements and it was nice of the US to send an envoy to try and explain to us,” he added. Syed Akbaruddin pointed out that US Deputy National Security Adviser Daleep Singh’s remarks were “not in keeping with the diplomatic traditions or means of engagement between two friends”. “We saw a display of rather crude public diplomacy of a nature that is not expected from a friendly country like the US trying to explain to us. Our ties with the US are on the upswing. There is a trajectory of greater engagement and certainly the remarks made by the US Deputy National Security Adviser were not in keeping with the diplomatic traditions or means of engagement between two friends. “I, therefore, had no choice but to explain to the young man that diplomacy requires a little bit of nuance, it requires a little bit of sophistication and public diplomacy in a country like India needs much more sophistication than what was expressed by him yesterday,” he concluded. \"So this is our friend...?? This is not the language of diplomacy. This is the language of coercion...\" Syed Akbaruddin had tweeted earlier today, sharing a newspaper clip that quoted Daleep Singh as saying, \"What we would not like to see is a rapid acceleration of India's imports from Russia as it relates to energy or any other exports that are currently being prohibited by the US or by other aspects of the international sanctions regime.” On Thursday, Daleep Singh also said that the US would not like to see any country engaging in financial transactions with the Russian central bank. Daleep Singh said India's current import of Russian energy doesn't violate any of the American sanctions, but at the same time added that Washington would like to see its allies and partners find ways to reduce their reliance on an \"unreliable supplier\". He also said India should not expect Russia to come to its defence in case China violates the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Reacting to Daleep Singh's comments, ex-UN envoy Syed Akbaruddin said, \"Somebody tell this young man that punitive unilateral economic measures are a breach of customary international law...\""

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A 33-page defence dossier compiled by BharatShakti with government inputs has unmasked Pakistan’s nefarious terror designs aimed to bleed India. India Today has accessed definitive proof of the terror plots hatched by Pakistan and the treachery being practiced by the neighbouring country. The dossier details how the Pakistani establishment, including its army, carries out infiltration bids across the borders. It also points to how the Hindus, a minority in Pakistan, are being butchered. The file highlights the killings of policemen, teachers, and migrant workers in Jammu & Kashmir by Pak-backed terrorists, who work as direct proxies of the forces in Islamabad, and exposes how Pakistan kills political workers and brainwashes the youth in Jammu & Kashmir to join the terror ranks. Also Read: | 30 Pakistani terrorists among 100 killed in Jammu and Kashmir this year The first section of the extensive file, titled “Terrorist Incidents Along The LoC And In The Hinterland”, lists and elaborates the 16 attempts made by Pakistani terrorists to cross over into India between 2020-2021. The comprehensive report also shows the route taken by the terrorists each time across the various sectors along the International Border, the arms and documents seized from them by the security forces. It also lists the number of terrorists killed by the security forces while trying to stop them. “The unabashed state-sponsored terror machinery operating from Pakistani soil remains rooted to a familiar modus operandi. Identify gullible or helpless youth in desperate need of money, indoctrinate them, drum radical and spiteful ideas into their impressionable minds and make them fight the so-called battle of jihad. If the catchment area extends to Kashmir, it includes Pakistan as well,” the report says, talking about the various recruits from the Valley. Also Read: | 26/11 Mumbai terror attack handler jailed for 15 years in Pakistan Chats attached with the dossier showed terrorists apprising their handlers in Pakistan about their movements. The third section of the dossier focuses on the target killings in Kashmir. “In a change of tack in recent years, especially after Article 370 that conferred special status on J&K was abrogated in 2019, Pakistan-sponsored terrorists have targeted civilians in the Valley. The idea is to create a sense of fear and insecurity in the minds of ordinary citizens - who are easy to target - while at the same time peddling a false narrative that things are not ‘normal’ in the former state. And all of this is done in the facade of simmering ‘local’ discontent, by ‘indigenous’ terror groups that are propped up and patronized by the Pakistani Deep State,” it reads. Also Read: | Explained: Dawat-e-Islami, the Pakistan based Sunni group linked to Udaipur tailor’s murderer “Since March this year, there has been a spurt in such violence, with over a dozen cases reported. Many of those targeted were religious minorities. According to data put forth by the Ministry of Home Affairs, 87 civilians have been killed in J&K since the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, compared to 177 civilians in the previous five years. The victims of terrorist attacks include women and children.” The report is substantiated by visuals of gruesome killings - of civilians, non-Kashmiri and migrant labourers and members of the minority community and also posters put up by terror outfits warning “non-local stooges to leave our land and get ready for dire consequences (sic)”. “Pakistan - supported terrorist groups have targeted political workers, leaders and elected representatives in J&K to dissuade them from participating in the political process and government functioning. A total of 27 such people from different political parties have been killed in the last three years,” the Army file says, listing the political killings in the Valley in recent times. Also Read: | Pakistani terrorist killed in encounter in J&K's Sopore “In a country that has seen more than three decades of military rule and where the Army calls the shots irrespective of which party forms the government, terrorism with a view to destabilising Jammu and Kashmir has thrived. Despite being placed in the ‘Grey List’ of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), its support to terrorists continues unabated. It’s time the country was named and shamed globally and held accountable for its actions,” the dossier concludes."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Beijing called US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s arrival in Taiwan on Tuesday a \"serious crush to political foundations\" between China and the US and said Washington would bear any consequences from the visit as its army conducts live-firing exercises surrounding the island. The Chinese foreign ministry, Taiwan affairs office, and National People’s Congress released a 1,143-word Chinese statement after Pelosi landed in Taipei on Tuesday. \"US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has gone ahead with her visit to Taiwan, disregarding China’s repeated opposition. The move has been a serious violation of the one-China principle and the stipulations of the three China-US joint communiques, a serious undermining of China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, a serious crushing of the political foundation of China-US relations, and sent a seriously wrong signal to ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces,\" the statement said. \"China will take all necessary measures to resolutely defend the country’s sovereignty and territory. The US and separatist forces will be responsible for any consequences caused by this,\" it added. But what exactly is the one-China principle that the Chinese government is so concerned about? 1) The one-China policy is a US foreign policy which recognises China's position that there is only one China on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. 2) It is a diplomatic acknowledgement that Taiwan is China. 3) It stipulates that the People's Republic is the sole legitimate government of China.

Separately, the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theatre Command said it will conduct joint military operations near Taiwan from Tuesday night, and will test-launch conventional missiles in the sea east of Taiwan. “This action is targeted at the US’s shocking recent major escalation on the Taiwan issue, and serves as a serious warning to Taiwanese independence forces or those seeking independence,” Shi Yi, a spokesperson for the Eastern Theater Command, said in a statement.

The quantity of explosives used in the Twin Tower demolition is equivalent to three warheads of the Agni-V missile, or 12 of the BrahMos missile, or four Prithvi missiles. Taller than the famous Qutub Minar in the national capital, the Supertech Twin Towers in Noida Sector 93A became dust and debris in a Rs 20 crore demolition job. They will be the tallest structures ever demolished in the history of India. Noida Twin Towers demolished. #TwinTower #Demolition @ShivAroor #Noida pic.twitter.com/V45mcpw6L7 — IndiaToday (@IndiaToday) August 28, 2022 India Today brings you a detailed report on India's most prominent missiles and their power. The Agni-V ICBM has been developed by the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) and Bharat Dynamics Limited. It weighs close to 50,000 kilograms. The missile is 1.75 meters tall with a diameter of two metres. The 1,500-kilogram warhead will be placed on top of the three-stage rocket boosters powered by solid fuel. Scientists have said that at its fastest, the ICBM will be 24 times faster than the speed of sound, travelling 8.16 kilometres per second, achieving a high speed of 29,401 kilometres per hour. The missile is equipped with a ring laser gyroscope inertial navigation system (NavIC) that works with satellite guidance. The missile can hit its target with pinpoint precision and can be launched from mobile launchers. FOLLOW LIVE COVERAGE ON NOIDA TWIN TOWERS DEMOLITION HERE BrahMos is capable of carrying a warhead of 300 kilograms (both conventional as well as nuclear) and has a top supersonic speed of Mach 2.8 to 3 (roughly three times the speed of sound). This flight test was monitored by all the sensors of the range instrumentation including telemetry, radar and electro-optical tracking systems deployed across the eastern coast and the down range ships. The BrahMos missile is a joint venture between India's DRDO and Russia's NPOM and both teams participated in the event. The objective has been to continuously upgrade the powerful, highly versatile BrahMos to increase its effectiveness and lethality against sea and land targets. BrahMos is a potent missile weapon system already inducted into the Armed Forces and used by the Army, Air Force and Navy in different variants. It can be launched from submarines, ships, aircraft, or land platforms. Prithvi is a tactical surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) of India under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP). It is deployed by India's Strategic Forces Command. (With agency input) READ | Noida Supertech Twin Towers demolition: Watch live in high definition"

Congress MP, Manish Tewari has been at the forefront of this demand. A survey conducted by LocalCircles also showed that those surveyed were in favour of travel to and from China being halted for the time being, given the uncertainties surrounding the infection and the manner in which China continues to give a rather inaccurate picture of the real crisis in the country. The fact is that the variant causing mayhem in China has already been reported in India. \"The travel ban makes no sense as the variant was reported in India as early as September,\" Dr Randeep Guleria, former director of AIIMS, told India Today. He also said that the infection has spread here to an extent, and the need is to improve the genome sequencing of positive samples from India to identify the nature of the variant. \"For this reason, people must come forward and do RT-PCR tests if they are showing symptoms of the infection,\" he said. Positive samples are sent by states for genome sequencing, which then helps determine the variant and its mutations. India, like many countries, has been lax about genome sequencing, given that cases are low and the RT-PCR tests being done are minimal. Read | China’s Covid scare: Is India prepared? Dr Guleria, who has been at the forefront of India's fight against the pandemic, has also stated that banning public gatherings and avoiding social gatherings is no longer necessary. \"Mask up if you are going to a crowded place, there is no need to avoid get-togethers yet,\" he said. Dr Guleria also advised senior citizens and vulnerable individuals with compromised immunity to be cautious. \"We are, however, in a good place now,\" he said. \"Replication of what happened in China is unlikely in India. We enjoy hybrid immunity, and we have had the experience of the Delta Wave, which has given us an idea about the pressure on the healthcare system,\" Guleria explained. The Center has also requested that the Covid protocol be followed but has not imposed any specific restrictions. In a high-level meeting held on Wednesday, the Union Health Ministry said that Covid is still here and that we can’t let our guard down.

Two people -- yet to be identified or apprehended -- are believed to be behind the incident. Security agencies ruled out a terror attack with sources saying that the Bathinda military station firing was most likely a case of \"fratricide\", i.e. army personnel firing on their own. The four jawans who died were from the Indian Army's 80 Medium Regiment, an artillery unit. The firing took place at 4:35 am inside the officers' mess located at the military station. Search operations for those behind the firing were on as of last updating this report. #WATCH | Visuals from outside Bathinda Military Station where four casualties have been reported in firing inside the station in Punjab; search operation underway pic.twitter.com/jgaaGVIdMS — ANI (@ANI) April 12, 2023 The incident happened inside the officers’ mess of the military station.

The firing incident was reported at 4.35 am inside the military station. “A firing incident was reported in the early hours of the morning around 4.35 am inside Bathinda Military Station. Station Quick Reaction Teams were activated. Area was cordoned off and sealed. Search operations are in progress. Four fatal casualties have been reported. Further details are being ascertained,” said South western command of the Indian Army. “No terror or fidayeen attack angle in this.

Families are also living in the area, sources said. An INSAS assault rifle went missing from the unit’s guard room a couple of days ago. All the entry gates of the Army Cantt in Bathinda have been closed. About two days ago, one Insas rifle with 28 cartridges had gone missing. Some army personnel may be behind this incident, according to Punjab Police sources. Army chief will brief the defence minister about the Bathinda incident. According to sources, the firing incident is a case of fratricidal killings in all probability and not a fit of rage kind of incident. The source added that the incident might be planned by one of two individuals as a rifle had gone missing from the unit two days back. Sources added that even police have not been allowed inside Bathinda Cantonment. A statement by the South western command of the Indian Army at 11 am said “four army jawans of an artillery unit succumbed to gunshot injuries.” “It has been ascertained that in the unfortunate incident, four army jawans of an artillery unit succumbed to gunshot injuries sustained during the incident. No other injuries to personnel or loss/damage to property have been reported,” the statement by the HQ SW Command read. The statement further read, “The area continues to be sealed off and joint investigations with Punjab Police are being coordinated to establish the facts of the case. All aspects including the possible case of involvement of an INSAS rifle along with 28 rounds reported missing two days back are being ascertained.” The families of jawans, killed in the Bathinda firing incident, are being informed about the loss of lives, said the Indian Army."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story As Karnataka heads for another high-stakes battle this month, the Congress is desperately attempting to return to power in the state. And in the battle for Chikkamagaluru, once an unpenetrable Congress citadel, the party is invoking its towering former leader Indira Gandhi. The Assembly seat had been with the Congress before BJP's CT Ravi dislodged it. The Congress has a long relationship with Chikkamagaluru, which the party is trying to revive in this election to oust the ruling BJP. Congress leaders Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi have time and again invoked the legacy of their grandmother and former prime minister Indira Gandhi, who made her political comeback with the Lok Sabha bypoll win in Chikkamagaluru in 1978. Before winning the Chikkamagaluru elections, Indira Gandhi had visited the Sharada Peeth to seek blessings of the sages. And years later, she was successful in reviving the Congress and served as the prime minister for the second time. In Karnataka, Indira Gandhi not only found her own revival but also the re-birth of the Congress party. The Gandhis have had a steady connection with Chikkamagaluru, but the constituency, both in the Karnataka Assembly as well as in the Lok Sabha, has switched sides. BJP's CT Ravi has been winning the Assembly seat since 2004 and BJP's Shobha Karandlaje has been winning it as MP since 2014. Congress has tried to strike an emotional chord with the people of Chikkamagaluru district by recalling the association of Indira Gandhi with the region. When Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi visited Chikkamagaluru in April, she recalled her grandmother Indira Gandhi’s victory in a by-election in Chikkamagaluru and appealed to people to support the party in the upcoming Karnataka Assembly elections. Voting for the Karnataka Assembly is scheduled on May 10. \"I'm coming after offering prayers to Sharada devi (Goddess Sharadamba in Sringeri). There I met Shankaracharya (the present pontiff). He asked me whether Indira Gandhi contested from here or not? I said yes she had contested from Chikkamagaluru. He blessed me,\" Priyanka Gandhi said. “Indira Gandhi was sent out of Parliament. But, the people of Chikkamagaluru sent her back to Parliament. Now, Rahul Gandhi has been sent out of Parliament in a false case. However, Rahul Gandhi has confidence that the people of the country will stand by him and the party,” she said. ALSO READ | Support me like you did Indira, says Rahul Gandhi in Chikmagalur Priyanka Gandhi's image with a temple elephant also went viral on social media after her Sringeri's visit in April. Even in 2018, the then Congress chief Rahul Gandhi followed the footsteps of Indira Gandhi by visiting Sharada devi in Sringeri as part of his election campaign for the upcoming Karnataka Assembly elections. The move mirrored what his grandmother Indira Gandhi did before the 1978 polls, which revived her political career. \"You supported my grandmother when she needed it the most. I can never forget this. Whenever you need me, I will always be available,\" Rahul Gandhi said in 2018. Rahul's father and former prime minister, the late Rajiv Gandhi, also frequently visited the temple and Mutt.The Sringeri Mutt is much revered by the Gandhi family. The magic of Congress icon Indira Gandhi in scenic Chikkamagaluru still lives on. Her image had taken a heavy hit after the Emergency, resulting in the loss of her parliamentary seat. But Indira Gandhi's win in 1978 in the Chikkamagaluru bypolls changed the dwindling electoral fortunes of the Congress and put her back in Parliament. Her victory in the byelection gave the Congress the much-needed boost post-Emergency. \"Indira Gandhi shared the pain with the locals when she was defeated. To date, there are many villages where people have kept a picture of Indira Gandhi. Indira is the mother of the country, people believed,\" Congress leader Atheeq Khaiser, who aided Indira Gandhi in 1978, said. \"But now there's a shift in generation and times have changed. But a few people still stick to their loyalty and vote for the Congress due to Indira Gandhi,\" Atheeq Khaiser added. The Congress at present is facing an existential crisis similar to its post-Emergency drubbing. For the Congress now, Karnataka has become a do-or-die battle. A win in Karnataka is much needed to enthuse party workers for the 2024 general election. ALSO READ | Free Nandini milk and cooking gas cylinders: This is what BJP is promising in its Karnataka manifesto This time, the party has fielded HD Thammaiah to defeat incumbent CT Ravi of the BJP. Congress is confident of winning the seat this time. \"This election is very important for me as well as for the party. BJP has fielded national general secretary CT Ravi. HUndred per cent I am defeating CT Ravi, \" he told India Today. Highlighting that the blood of Indira Gandhi still runs here, HD Thammaiah added, \"I am inspired by Indira Gandhi. I was inspired by Rahul Gandhi during my college days.\" But BJP’s sitting MLA CT Ravi rebuts the Indira factor. \"Strangely, Chikkamagaluru, which had embraced Indira Gandhi with enormous faith and love, doesn’t have a single statue of her,\" he says. What remains to be seen is whether Rahul and Priyanka's fight for survival and relevance on the road to 2024 yield positive results for the Congress. Will Karnataka be the beginning of better things for the Congress or will the past remain a past? ALSO READ | Karnataka Assembly polls: 'Vote from home' exercise begins for voters above 80 years"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Compared to the decade of inertia that the project had to navigate before being approved, the next few weeks will see a rapid burst of major milestones in India's acquisition of the C295 new generation military transport aircraft. The Indian Air Force will receive its first Airbus-built C295 military transport aircraft in September, the first of 16 that will be built by the European conglomerate in southern Spain while rapidly scaling up its partnership with Tata Group to build another 40 at a sprawling upcoming factory in Vadodara starting in 2026. First batch of Indian C295 pilots complete training in Seville, Spain. Meanwhile, groundbreaking ceremony of the C295 training facility in Agra happened recently. Will be ready by late next year. Detailed reports on the Made-in-India Tata/Airbus C295 program soon on @IndiaToday . pic.twitter.com/y7t3WYz9DA — Shiv Aroor (@ShivAroor) July 18, 2023 The deal for 56 aircraft, signed by India in October 2021, is the first-ever aircraft manufacturing enterprise in the country led by the private sector. So far, military aircraft manufacturing has been a total monopoly of state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL). READ | India opens its stealth fighter jet programme to private players The Air Force depends hugely on transport aircraft for the movement of personnel, weapons, fuel, and hardware across vast distances in the country and beyond. While the C295 will fulfill the lighter end of air transport duties, the IAF also operates American C-130J Super Hercules planes in the medium category and the giant C-17 Globemaster III for very heavy loads. Alongside preparations for delivery of the first C295 aircraft, an inaugural batch of Indian Air Force pilots has completed flight training and will shortly make way for a second batch. The Indian pilots are all qualified on the IAF's existing British vintage HS748 Avros – which the C295 airplanes will directly replace – and workhorse Ukrainian Antonov An-32s – which the C295 could potentially replace going forward. But building the first sixteen C295s in Spain is the easy part for Airbus, given that the aircraft are rolling out from an established decades-old factory. It’s the second bit – making 40 aircraft in India at the Tata facility for delivery between 2026-31 – that has the Airbus team at battle stations. Executing the programme on time, efficiently, and on budget makes it one of the most high-pressure projects ever embarked upon by Airbus. \"It is unprecedented for Airbus,\" says Jorge Tamarit, head of the C295 programme in India. \"This is the first time the company is deploying a full production system to another country. What's happening in India is, therefore, of enormously greater complexity and significance. While Tata began 'metal-cutting' last November for the first of 40 C295s it is tasked to build, things shift into top gear next week in Hyderabad when a group of parts, technically described as the main constituent assembly (MCA), begins being unboxed from Tata's warehouses and put together to create major components of the airframe, including its tail and fuselage. Tata's Hyderabad facility will fabricate and churn out major sections of the aircraft, after which they will be transported to Vadodara where each C295 will get its final shape starting late 2024, be fitted with engines and electronics, and delivered to the IAF at a maximum rate of a dozen aircraft per year. While the percentage of Indian material in the aircraft will scale up progressively with each delivery, it is aircraft No.32 that will be closest to being a fully Indian C295. While the C295 fleet will necessarily operate from a number of air bases, the aircraft will initially be situated in Vadodara. In March, IAF officials and Airbus representatives conducted a bhoomi pujan ceremony at the Agra air base for the C295 crew training center that will be ready in late 2024. The IAF C295s being built in Spain also have a handful of crucial Indian systems, including radar and missile warning systems supplied by the state-owned Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) and a counter-measure dispensing system supplied by Bharat Dynamics Ltd (BDL). With these systems fully integrated, the first aircraft flew on May 8, with the second aircraft in final assembly. Airbus will deliver seven aircraft in 2024 and the final eight of its share of 16 in 2025. A year later, the first Made-in-India C295 will be ready, making for what is intended to be an uninterrupted stream of supply till 2023. To be sure, the Vadodara facility is almost certain to build more than 40 C295 aircraft. Both the Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard are interested in at least nine and six C295 aircraft, respectively, configured for the maritime surveillance role. The Border Security Force could be on board for a handful of the type, apart from a passenger version of the C295 potentially feeding into a hungry short-haul civil aviation space. \"We're focused on the delivery of 56 aircraft. But there is definitely a future beyond the 56. 56 is a lot, and not a lot at the same time,\" says Jean-Brice Dumont, executive vice president of Airbus's military air systems division. Apart from filling a long-standing requirement of the IAF and giving India its first private sector military airframer, the C295 project is crucial in another way – it is the first Make-in-India programme that also has a 30% offset obligation. Which means, other than the stipulated license manufacture of the aircraft in India, Airbus must also use nearly a third of the Rs 21,935 crore deal value investing in or sourcing from India. What might seem like a win-win for Indian industry is being seen cautiously, however, given India's shaky handling of offsets thus far in the defense space. With 15,000 immediate skilled jobs and 10,000 indirect jobs over the next decade, the C295 programme is a major boost for India's aerospace ecosystem, but the optimal absorption and channeling of offset billions will be crucial to the big picture success of the programme."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his delegation have finally taken off after being stranded in India for over 36 hours after the G20 Summit. Trudeau and his team were stranded due to a technical problem with the Canadian PM's aircraft. Government sources told India Today that the Centre had offered the services of Air India One for Justin Trudeau's return on Monday. Air India One is a two-plane fleet of Boeing 777s used only by India's president, vice-president and prime minister for their international trips. Canada, however, declined the offer and responded to the Indian government approximately six hours after the proposal was made, expressing their preference to wait for their own plane. Justin Trudeau, who arrived in Delhi on September 8, was supposed to fly back home two days later on Sunday. However, a last-minute technical snag in his Airbus plane forced the Canadian PM and his delegation to prolong their stay in the city. Finally, on Monday, the technical issue was resolved and Trudeau's aircraft was cleared to fly. Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar was at the airport to see the Canadian PM off and thanked him for attending the G20 Summit. Trudeau's aircraft took off at around 1310 hrs (1:10 pm IST). \"On behalf of PM Narendra Modi Ji and my colleagues in government, I was at the airport today to thank Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada for his presence at the G20 Summit and wished him and his entourage a safe trip back home,\" the minister wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter). According to a previous CBC News report, the Canadian Air Force's CC-150 Polaris plane, which was on its way to pick up Trudeau, was diverted to London. No reason was given for the unscheduled diversion."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story This is the first-hand account of India Today TV journalist Shiv Aroor, currently reporting from Israel on the ongoing war with Hamas. Shiv was among the foreign journalists who witnessed the 43-minute raw footage that the Israeli military released, showing atrocities by Hamas terrorists during the October 7 attack. Below is Shiv's complete description of the footage. I just sat through 43 minutes of footage compiled by the Israeli Defence Forces obtained from Hamas terrorist bodycams, mobile phones, CCTV and traffic cameras on October 7. A grieving but galvanised Israel is bewildered at having to ‘explain’ its actions in Gaza, suspicious that an international narrative has shifted focus away from the barbarism of October 7. Therefore, a 43-minute ‘reminder’ of where the current cycle of violence began. I don’t wish to embellish this piece with my opinion. I’ve spent the last five days reporting in both Israel and the Palestinian territories, and I am humbly aware of the terrible shades of grey that colour this conflict. There is no question of the suffering of innocents in Gaza and a looming humanitarian crisis of the kind the Palestinian people have seen several times before. But what you’re about to read is not my opinion about this war. It is simply a detailed description of what I saw in those 43 minutes of footage. The first clip opens with the smiling, excited face of a Hamas terrorist in the back of a Toyota pickup truck, waving his AK-47 in the air. With him are four others holding tight to the sides of the truck as it speeds along a dusty track. All dressed in black with the signature green Hamas headband. After a few words in Arabic, the man filming the video begins an ‘Allahu Akbar’ chant and is joined by the others. The screen cuts to black. The second clip, one that the IDF included in 90 seconds of footage that was made public, is a dashcam video taken from a civilian’s car. As the driver approaches, he sees armed men on the road. This isn’t an unusual sight in a highly militarised Israel, but one of the men on the road waves at the car and then fires right at it. The panicked driver steps on the gas to speed past, but the car is peppered with bullets cracking the glass. The driver, clearly hit by the time, loses control and the car careens off its path and smashes into a parked SUV. The screen cuts to black. The next clip is Hamas bodycam footage showing a bloodied body lying face down by the side of a car. The car is peppered with bullet holes. The screen cuts to black. The next clip shows a white SUV speeding off the road and into a field. Two Hamas terrorists chase the car into the field, catch up with the stranded vehicle and shoot the driver point blank. The screen cuts to black. The next clip is dashcam footage from a Hamas-driven car. The dashboard is red velvet. Voices can be heard speaking in Arabic as the car snakes into a Kibbutz. The car then passes the body of a blonde woman in jeans and a black sleeveless shirt face down on the road. A voice off-camera is heard hooting as if to cheer. The screen cuts to black. The next clip is from traffic cameras. A wide shot from height shows Hamas terrorists climbing out of their pickup truck and ambushing a car on the other side of the road, firing repeatedly into it. The screen cuts to black. The next clip is from the Kibbuts Be’eri, where over 130 people were murdered on October 7, an area I reported from earlier this week. Neighbourhood CCTV footage shows a Hamas terrorist wearing an IDF uniform stealthily approaching the gate and then clambering into the guard booth. A Tesla car approaches the gate. The terrorist in the booth and another from off to the side enter the frame and fire into the car killing both occupants. The driver is a young man who slumps to the side after being shot. The screen cuts to black. The next clip is bodycam footage from a Hamas terrorist. The ‘buddy’ pair are seen walking inside a Kibbutz. Speaking constantly to each other in Arabic, they walk past a children’s park with colourful slides, tubes and swings. They approach a garage which is revealed to contain a parked ambulance. The Hamas terrorist wearing a bodycam fires at one of the tyres of the ambulance, deflating it. The hiss of released air is heard. The two terrorists are then seen venturing deeper into the Kibbutz. A black dog, likely a Labrador, appears and runs toward the two Hamas men. The man wearing the bodycam fires three shots killing the dog instantly on the track. The two terrorists then step close to a house. They peep inside through an open window. The terrorist in front takes aim and fires a single shot. A loud groan, likely, of a senior citizen, is heard. It is not clear if it’s this same house or another, but the two men then step into the front porch of the house and using a lighter, set it ablaze. The two men then leave, one of them whispering Allahu Akbar. A playful mobile ringtone is heard from a house, catching the attention of the two Hamas men. They enter the house. It appears empty but the occupants are clearly not far — an iPad sits on the table with its screen still on, while a MacBook sits next to it. They venture deeper into the house but do not find anyone. The screen cuts to black. The next clip is CCTV footage from a home in a Kibbutz. A father with 2 boys — all in their underpants — enters a room, panic-stricken. The audio captures the father seeming to tell the boys to hide. It appears they are hiding because Hamas terrorists have entered their home. A second CCTV camera shows the father and two boys attempting to exit the house through a courtyard of sorts, but are ambushed by two Hamas terrorists. One of the terrorists shoots the father point blank. The two boys, their father’s blood spattered across them, run back into the house. The CCTV now captures the two boys in what appears to be the kitchen. Both boys are wailing. One boy tells the other ‘Dad is dead’. Then he falls to the floor, bangs on it and cries, \"Why am I alive? Why?\" Then he composes himself and turns to his younger brother whose face appears to be covered in the blood spatter from his father’s gunshot wound. The elder boy asks the younger one \"Can you see from this eye? Can you see at all?\" The boy answers in the negative. The outside CCTV camera that captured the father’s killing now shows the mother returning with two Kibbutz security guards. She sees the crumpled, bullet-riddled body of her husband (not clear in the image) and collapses crying. She is held up by the two security men who then drag her away off camera. The screen cuts to black. The next clip is from Kibbutz Be’eri. The video shows a group of Hamas terrorists on motorcycles congregating around a Blue Mazda. One of the terrorists enters the frame, opens the front passenger door and drags a body out to the road. He searches the body’s pockets and pulls out a mobile phone. More terrorists enter the frame and begin to empty the car, throwing out a large ice keg and other items. A second body is pulled out from the driver’s side. It’s a young man in shorts. He is flung to the ground near the car, where his body lands with an apparent thud. The two terrorists then climb into the car and drive off. The screen cuts to black. The next clip is a mobile video taken by a Hamas terrorist. Filmed inside a house, it shows a grievously injured man lying on his back on the floor. Wearing a yellow T-shirt with Hebrew text, he appears to have been shot non-fatally in the stomach. A terrorist picks up a construction hoe kept nearby and, while chanting 'Allahu Akbar' loudly, hacks at the injured man’s neck repeatedly with all his strength until his arms slump to the side. The attack does not decapitate the man, though it is clearly enough to kill him. The screen cuts to black. The next clip is mobile footage taken by a Hamas terrorist inside a house. Chanting 'Allahu Akbar', he opens a room door revealing blood spattered on the floor and four bodies piled up. The screen cuts to black. The next clip shows a group of Hamas terrorists torching a white Toyota. The screen cuts to black. The next clip is a video selfie showing a group of Hamas men smiling, talking to each other, cheering into the camera and chanting 'Allahu Akbar'. It is not clear if they are the same men seen in the previous footage. The screen cuts to black. A woman with red curly hair is seen slumped on a bed face down, the area around her face smudged with blood. She has likely been shot in the face or head. The screen cuts to black. A mobile video follows a thick trail of blood, the kind of trail that would be left if a body was dragged. It ends in a room with two bodies, congealed blood turning black on the floor amidst sacks of cement and other construction material. The screen cuts to black. The next picture is a still image. It’s a picture of an infant in diapers with three gunshot wounds, including one in the head. It’s an unblurred version of the same image that the Israeli Foreign Ministry released days after the October 7 attack in the wake of the ‘beheaded babies’ report from Kibbutz Kfar Aza. More stills show a completely charred infant, the head of either an infant or a toddler, more charred infants and a dog shot dead in a living room. Two still pictures show an ISIS flag on the floor, followed by pictures of a woman shot dead in a baby playroom and another slumped with gunshot wounds in a laundry room. The next item is the full audio clip of a young Hamas terrorist who phones his parents in Gaza during the attack. The publicly released audio captures the frenzied terrorist repeatedly tell first his father that he has killed 10 jews and that he should see his WhatsApp. He asks for his mother, who comes to the phone apparently in tears, asking her son to come back with god’s help. He says there is no return, and that this is the way he has chosen for martyrdom. His weeping mother pleads with him to come home. The next clip shows a pile of bodies slumped on a park bench next to a shop. The wall has a bookshelf on it. The screen cuts to black. The next clip is mobile footage filmed by a group of women IDF soldiers inside a room. The sound of rifle fire can be heard nearby as the women speak to each other in panicked whimpers. They huddle together. The screen cuts to black. Another home invasion by a group of Hamas terrorists shows them entering what appears to be a study. One of the home’s occupants is clearly under the table, though it isn’t clear if he/she is alive or shot earlier. The terrorists chant Allahu Akbar and fire into the table. One of the terrorists is holding an American M4A1 carbine. The screen cuts to black. A still picture shows what appears to be an IDF soldier’s corpse on the road. Covered in blood, the head is missing. It is not clear how the head was removed. The next clip shows a frenzied group of Hamas terrorists in a circle around a body that is revealed to be a dead IDF soldier. They bludgeon his head with their boots while chanting 'Allahu Akbar'. The screen cuts to black. Next is a clip that Hamas had posted on social media soon after the attack, showing terrorists dragging a woman (her hands bound, face bloodied) out of the boot of a jeep and pushing her into the back seat. This appears to be in Gaza. A small crowd forms chanting 'Allahu Akbar', while two men stand with their middle fingers raised akimbo. The screen cuts to black. The next video is from the Re’em rave party. It opens with smiling selfie videos of party-goers. In one frame the background shows what appear to be inbound Hamas paragliders. The scene quickly shifts to young men and women running for their lives as the firing begins. Some of them run into a field to escape the approaching terrorists. In the parking lot of the rave party, a Toyota pickup truck full of Hamas terrorists zooms into the frame and ambushes a Honda hatchback. One terrorist climbs onto the bonnet of another car and fires off-camera presumably at party-goers trying to escape to safety. The scene cuts to bodycam footage from a Hamas terrorist who fires into a row of portable toilets set up for the rave party. A still image shows the inside of one of the toilets with large spatters of blood. The footage then cuts back to the car park where Hamas terrorists are seen dragging bodies into a pile. In one corner of the frame, a car is set on fire. A young woman in spectacles wearing a white dress with red flowers is seen in a selfie video whimpering as she appears to hide from the terrorists nearby. Another group of men and women are seen hiding in what appears to be a dumpster. The footage cuts back to the car park where a man is dragged out of his car and shot point blank. A body on the ground stirs for a moment. A terrorist walks in from the off frame and fires two shots into the body, ‘finishing’ it off. The footage then cuts to a terrorist dragging a woman’s body out of a car and tossing it into a field. Amidst chants of Allahu Akbar, a body is set on fire on the road. A selfie video shows a terrified young man hiding from a shelter that appears to have bodies inside it. The man peeps from behind a wall. The scene then shifts to Hamas terrorists dragging wounded men and women into the back of a pickup truck presumably as hostages. Amidst wails and whimpers, they are driven away. Some of them are grievously injured. The screen cuts to black. The next clip is mobile footage by a Hamas terrorist or the hostages in the pickup truck as it speeds back towards Gaza, though it is not clear what the precise location is. Filmed at an angle, it shows blue sky on one side, brown golden earth and fields on the other, and the bloodied hostages in the middle. The screen cuts to black. A survivor is then seen filming charred remains and burning cars. Two cars show charred remains in their seats. A third shows a charred skull lying on its side. The screen cuts to black. The next clip is night footage from a police mobile phone showing responders trudging through a field of ash, strewn apparently with body parts and burnt organs. The camera pans to what appears to be a small pile of charred bodies in a pile. A wailing man looks for his family among the dead, filmed by a third person. Around him are broken and burnt bodies. The screen cuts to black. Next, we see a series of still images of charred bodies. Three of the pictures show hands tied. One shows a gag tied around the head of a burnt head. One charred body of a woman is seen in a crawling position as if trying to escape. A final image shows a dumpster filled with charged torsoes and body parts. The screen cuts one final time to black."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A solidarity march in support of Israel was held by the Indian community in Tel Aviv on Friday. Visuals from the scene showed several members of the Indian community, with some being residents of Israel for over a decade, partaking in the march. The participants carried Israeli and Indian flags with them, held a candle vigil, and even chanted slogans to commemorate their love and support for the strife-torn nation. India Today TV was on the ground in Tel Aviv, located along the beautiful Mediterranean coastline and one of the most popular cities in Israel, to hear the Indian community members share their experiences of living in the country and how life has been for them since the deadly October 7 attack by the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. Carrying several Israeli flags and one Indian flag, the participants marched through the streets of Tel Aviv, shouting \"Bharat Mata Ki Jai\" and \"We love Israel\". They also held placards with the message 'I stand with Israel'. Some were seen with the Israeli flag wrapped around shoulder as they showed support for the victims of Hamas attack. Israel houses thousands of Indians, who are spread across varied work sectors such as caregivers and workers, among others. Indians who decided to stay back in Tel Aviv, also one of Israel's largest cities, gathered at the solidarity march to show their love for the country where they have made a home for themselves. Catch live updates of Israel-Hamas war here Speaking to India Today TV, some women who have been residing in Israel for more than 10 years, said that they love the country and feel \"very safe\" there. \"I have been here for 16-17 years and feel very safe here. We will always stand with Israel,\" one woman said. There were many children present at the solidarity march. India Today TV spoke to some kids who were born in Israel and have left the country, even for their homeland in India. One girl aged around 13 years said that they are used to rocket strikes. \"We have a strong army who take care of us day and night,\" she told India Today TV. The girl, however, said that it's difficult for them to go outside in the current situation since there are terrorists everywhere in Israel - hinting to the Hamas infiltration on October 7. Another girl said that what Hamas is doing to \"children\" is \"completely wrong\". \"They don't deserve it,\" she said, referencing the killing and kidnapping of Israeli children and babies by Hamas. Several Indians chose to move back to India since Israel-Hamas war began, but these Indians opted to stay back - driven by their love for Israel and jobs. One woman told India Today TV that \"Israel is heaven\" for her. The deadly war between Israel and Hamas has so far claimed over 7,000 lives on both sides. As many as 1,400 Israelis have been killed in the war. India has shown support for Israel, but reiterated the country's position for a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. India on Friday abstained in the UN General Assembly from voting on a draft resolution tabled by Jordan, calling for an immediate humanitarian truce in the Israel-Hamas conflict as it did not make mention of the terrorist group 'Hamas'. The resolution also called for unhindered humanitarian access in the Gaza Strip and was co-sponsored by over 40 countries, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, South Africa, Maldives and Russia."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The BJP stamped its authority in the heartland with three spectacular wins on Sunday, consequently widening its footprint in the country just months ahead of the general election. The party is now in power in 12 of the 28 states in India and is in the ruling coalition in four others. The Congress, on the other hand, is now left with only three states - Telangana, where it won by dislodging the KCR government, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh. An India Today interactive map shows the party’s expansion across states since 2014 when the BJP led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power. As of December 2023, the BJP-ruled states constitute 58 per cent of India's land area, comprising 57 per cent of the population. The Opposition-governed states, meanwhile, cover 41 per cent of the country's land area with 43 per cent of the population. The map that has evolved over the years - combined with the BJP’s victories in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh - makes a huge statement ahead of 2024. Hours after the wins, PM Modi said that the BJP's \"hat-trick\" in state elections was a guarantee of the party's \"hat-trick in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls\" as he described the verdict as an endorsement of the party’s “politics of good governance and transparency”. With the three state wins, the BJP now accounts for almost half of the 543 Lok Sabha seats. Although Congress won Telangana, its second victory in the south this year, Sunday's outcome is seen as a setback. The four states are home to more than 160 million voters and account for 82 seats in the 543-member parliament. \"We always said we would win the heartland states,\" BJP President JP Nadda told news agency Reuters. \"The results are the outcome of our finest political strategy and work on the ground.\" Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), with its governments in Delhi and Punjab, has now emerged as the third-biggest national party. When the PM Modi-led government first came to power in the Centre in 2014, the party already had governments in a few states, including Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Goa and Chhattisgarh, among others. Since then, the BJP has grabbed 12 states under its belt, and Narendra Modi is now among the longest serving Prime Ministers in the country. By December 2017, the land area of the BJP-ruled or its coalition states increased to 78 per cent, with 69 per cent of India's population. The Opposition states covered a meagre 22 per cent of land area with 31 per cent of the population. One of the notable achievements in the BJP's political journey of nine years has been its presence in the North East. In 2014, it hardly had any presence there, but as of 2023, the party single-handedly rules three states and is in a coalition government in Meghalaya, Nagaland and Sikkim. Mizoram has been governed by non-BJP parties. On Sunday, PM Modi said that during the recent assembly elections, efforts were made to \"divide the country based on castes\". \"I kept saying that for me, four castes are important - nari shakti (women empowerment), yuva shakti (youth empowerment), kisaan (farmers) and gareeb parivaar (poor families),\" he added. The Prime Minister has repeatedly targeted the Congress over corruption, dynasty politics and appeasement. At the same time, he has highlighted the BJP’s focus on governance delivered by \"double-engine\" governments, and new India narrative. Meanwhile, the rifts in the Opposition appear to have widened further after the Congress’s reversal in electoral fortunes. Far from uniting - more than ever - to stop the BJP juggernaut in 2024, allies have taken digs at the Congress for the losses. Trinamool Congress's Kunal Ghosh said that the result shows the \"failure of Congress\" rather than the \"success of BJP\". He, however, was hopeful the defeat \"will not affect Lok Sabha polls, and a combined INDIA coalition will win\". Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said the INDIA bloc \"cannot win\" 2024 if this was the situation."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Roughly scratching his beard as he lounged back in his chair, the officer watched us carefully, his head tilted to one side. It had clearly been a while since he had visited the barber, but the look was far from unfitting. He listened to our questions carefully, his gaze unwavering, his body relaxed but alert. Talking to a pair of journalists in a subterranean bunker-like chamber in a freezing February 2017 in Delhi wasn’t something he had ever expected to do. He rested one combat boot-clad foot on the other knee and shrugged, his breath visible in the cold. “So what do you want to know,” he asked, lighting a Classic Mild cigarette from a battered pack lying on a table off to his left. “Everything you feel comfortable sharing about the operation,” I said, eagerly. “I don’t think I can say very much.” For the next 45 minutes, journalist Rahul Singh and I did our best to get the officer to begin his story. At the back of our minds, there was panic. It had already been nearly an hour, and we hadn’t got a word out of him. How much longer do we have? Would we ever get a chance to meet him again? Would someone march in shortly and usher us out, informing us that our time was up? Would the Army change its mind about giving us access to this officer? Was this meeting going to be futile? Then, abruptly, Rahul, the other journalist in the room, spoke. He was clearly as aware as I was that we didn’t have time to waste. We needed to hear about the operation. “We think the public wants to hear this story, and who better than you to tell it?” For a fleeting moment, the officer allowed himself to enjoy the truth of that question. Who better, indeed? Only weeks earlier, he had been decorated with a Kirti Chakra for what he had done. “But why this story,” he asked, a playful smile quickly erupting in a short snorting guffaw. He knew immediately that this was a cheeky question. Five months earlier, the officer sitting in front of us had led a dangerous commando raid across the Line of Control into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and returned after his squads had killed nearly 40 trained terrorists, waiting to infiltrate. Everyone knew the operation had happened, because on the morning of September 29, 2016, the Army had officially announced it. But nobody beyond the officer in front of us, his unit, the 4 Para Special Forces, and a restricted group of politicians and personnel spread between Delhi, Udhampur and Srinagar, knew anything at all about what had really happened. The operation was a punitive strike eleven days after infiltrators from similar staging areas in the PoK had attacked an Army base in Uri, killing 19 soldiers. The strike back across the LoC was projected as a pre-emptive attack on terror launchpads, but to a grieving, angry Indian public, the operation was seen as wholly retributive. But what really happened? And how? Again, it was Rahul who answered. “Because General Rawat agrees with us. He, too, thinks this is a story the country needs to hear.” Rahul and I left that bunker office three hours later. In our trembling hands, carefully folded, were fourteen sheets of paper, filled with hurriedly written notes in dark blue. The notes of the first and only interview of the officer who had led the mission are emblazoned forever in the public mind as the ‘2016 Uri surgical strikes’. Rahul and I walked down Raisina Hill to our cars in silence. We both knew it would take a moment to fully digest what had just happened. A four-hour meeting with the most famous living Special Forces man in the country. The media and internet knew his name, but it would never be formally acknowledged as part of the now legendary operation. In our book, [1] too, the commando officer with the scruffy beard would be identified as Major Mike Tango. As Rahul got into his car, he looked over at me. We both had the same thought. General Rawat. [Two weeks earlier] ‘Why not?’ General Bipin Rawat’s eyes twinkled as he let the words sink in, fully aware of the effect they were having on two journalists whose principal impulse at that point was “ poochhne mein kya jaata hai?” The Chief of the Army Staff’s office in South Block is an imposing one, panelled in wood, softly lit, decorated with regimental regalia and dominated by an outsized painting of that most famous image from the 1971 war, the signing of the instrument of surrender. “Are you saying we’ll get access, and we can write about the Uri operation, Sir,” I asked, not completely buying into what the Army chief had tossed into the conversation. But why were we even in General Bipin Rawat’s office seeking near impossible permission to access men and materials that would help us tell the true story of the Uri surgical strikes? A few days earlier, basking in the glow of a viral news report by me about a dauntless young Indian Air Force pilot who had refused to eject from a grievously damaged MiG-29 fighter, I had received a phone call from Rahul congratulating me on the story and how well it had been received. When I said I would be doing more of them, he paused for a moment. And then, he said that was a terrible idea. Arguing that the shelf life of news reports would ensure the stories would be forgotten soon, Rahul carefully suggested that we think bigger. A book. If ever there was a moment when the India’s Most Fearless series was born, it was this. “Yes, why not?” General Rawat said again. “The Army has already acknowledged the operation. Let’s get you to meet the officer who led the strikes. See if it’s a story you want to tell.” “We would like to speak to you too,” I said. Ten days before the terror attack on the Uri army base, Lt. Gen Bipin Rawat had become Vice Chief of the Army Staff. Familiar with the abruptness of conflict and turbulence, having served as commander of the multi-nation UN Brigade in Congo and later being instrumental in an earlier ‘surgical strike’ into Myanmar in 2015, Rawat’s new appointment plunged him straight into how the Army needed to react after the Uri attack. He immediately became part of the small team at Army Headquarters that monitored the operation. “The only people who matter are the guys who went across,” said General Rawat. “They are the knife’s edge. This story must come from them and them alone.” [7 months later] At the launch of India’s Most Fearless 1 , we told General Bipin Rawat that we couldn’t possibly have anyone else as chief guest. In a short speech still remembered by everyone who attended, this is what General Rawat said: “Service personnel in uniform, be they from the army, navy, air force or coast guard, are expected to perform their duty under very challenging circumstances. Let me tell you, while the armed forces are there to maintain peace, there are no words like peacetime in their dictionary. Peacetime is when you train and prepare for any future eventuality. And it is this that holds us in good stead. This book talks about the heroic deeds, the sacrifices, of many a soldier, sailor and airman. The surgical strikes are just two among them. Our men and women in uniform have never let us down. Never the service and never the country. And never ever will they fail in their mission. India’s Most Fearless recounts the deeds of a few whom the authors could meet or whose mentors they could interview. And the stories in this book are truly captivating, hair-raising and motivating for the future generations of our armed forces, providing encouragement to many of you here, and to many in schools and colleges perhaps looking at the services as a profession. Yet, there are many others who have performed similar tasks and got away unnoticed. Their acts of valour and sacrifice also we cannot forget. More than those counted in the book are those who have not been counted. We were fortunate in the operations that we conducted recently, everybody returned. But there are occasions when you leave some of your comrades behind. And the untold stories of those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen who do not return, sometimes remain unaccounted for, unrecorded and untold. It is time to remember every man and woman in uniform out there performing their duty in the service of the nation, living up to the rich heritage of our defence forces. We in India are very poor at recording history. And it is good that these events are being recorded now for posterity. Someday, we hope these stories will find their way into textbooks in our schools, where the future generations can read about and appreciate the role of the armed forces. We are at peace today because somebody is defending our borders, the airspace and the oceans around us. And it is because of these people that we stand proud today. And we can assure you, that the armed forces will never let our nation down. Never ever. Because the armed forces are prepared for any mission, any time and anywhere. Thank you, and Jai Hind.” Outside the main hall of the book launch at Delhi’s India International Centre, television cameras surrounded him for sound bites about the surgical strikes and continued infiltration attempts at the LoC. What he said would make headlines through primetime and appear in all the papers the following day: “Terrorists will keep coming because terror camps are operational across the LoC. We are ready. We will keep receiving them and dispatching them two-and-a-half feet below the ground.\" It was near impossible to get a word in with the Army chief, mobbed as he was by the media and guests. Finally easing himself out of the scrum of journalists, escorted by his security towards the exit, he paused when he saw Rahul and me, walked across and shook our hands. “You’ll have to keep writing these books now. No stopping.” Barely five months later, Rahul received a text message from the Army chief. “Hope you’ve begun the next book. Many stories to be told.” Perhaps on the strength of the fact that the first book was based on actual firsthand accounts of recent military operations, it spawned a large community of readers that echoed the goading we frequently received from the Chief of the Army Staff. If we thought we could rest and enjoy the success of the first book, we couldn’t have been more wrong. In May 2019, the second India’s Most Fearless book was out, leading with a firsthand account of the Balakot air strikes, punitive retribution for the Pulawama suicide bombing that killed 40 personnel from the Central Reserve Police Force. Despite being a guiding force behind the second book too, General Rawat declined to be chief guest for the launch, suggesting we invite the Chief of the Air Staff since this second book led with an air force story. As it happened, India’s Most Fearless 2 was never formally launched. In September 2019, Rahul and I called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to present him with a copy of the two books. Modi knew General Rawat better than most Prime Ministers know their Army chiefs. Modi had handpicked General Rawat as Chief of the Army Staff in 2016, bypassing two senior officers, a move that triggered its share of controversy within the army and in the media. In the conversation, the Prime Minister told us about putting into action an effort to smoothen the protocols for families of military personnel killed in action, a project he had entrusted General Rawat with. That Modi placed great faith in the General wasn’t up for question. And it was cemented less than four months later when General Bipin Rawat, a day before he retired, was appointed the country’s first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS). Rahul and I called on new CDS late in January 2020. The conversation focused on the many things he was hoping to do to optimise the military and get them working more jointly than ever before. It was a courtesy call that had nothing to do with our books. But as we left, that same twinkle in his eye, he asked, “Has work begun on your next?” The Covid pandemic hit a few weeks later, in March 2020. And the world’s biggest military standoff between India and China began in eastern Ladakh in May. Consumed by his new role and a totally transformed world, we didn’t see General Rawat again for nearly two years. Grappling, like everyone else, with a dystopian new world in the grip of a virus, Rahul and I quietly began work on the third book. In June 2020, when Indian and Chinese army personnel clashed in a horrific brawl in Ladakh’s Galwan River valley, we knew that the story of this terrible bloodletting that saw a smaller Indian force fight off a treacherous attack by a much larger armed Chinese force, needed to be told. By giving us clearance to flagship our books with firsthand accounts of the most prominent military operations of our time, the bar had already been set impossibly high. The third book couldn’t possibly happen without an account of the Galwan clash. This posed a dilemma. The standoff in Ladakh was still very much on. A shape-shifting military operation meant the story was constantly in motion. Choosing to write about it in our book therefore presented us with a moving target that was seeing dramatic swings between the two sides across battlefields, including the banks of the splendid Pangong Tso. It would be difficult to capture it without running the risk of missing out on what came next. But once again, permission came through for us to become the first (and once again, only) writers with access to the men of 16 Bihar Regiment, the unit that fought back the Chinese in Galwan. The story took shape quickly, but the third book would be hugely delayed. Access to personnel and families during the Covid lockdown made things deeply difficult. And the anxieties of a devastatingly altered world meant that it would take weeks, sometimes months longer, to set up meetings or even calls. Deadlines slipped, and an unforgettable year slipped by. Few knew that the coming year would be infinitely worse in India. We stayed in touch with General Rawat but didn’t feel it would be right to disturb him regarding the book. Rahul and I were working on the chapters and interviews, but the third book was practically on the backburner of real life. But General Rawat hadn’t forgotten us or the books. On December 3, 2021, Rahul received a text inviting us to go see him. In the wake of the devastating second Covid wave and a year full of military tumult in Ladakh, his invitation was a major source of relief. We went to see him the next evening. “I hope the third book is done and dusted, you guys are taking too long,” he quipped, as we sat in his lawn at his Kamraj Road residence. Before we left, General Rawat told us he had a few ideas for the next books in the series and that he would invite us back for a longer discussion. We’ll never know what those ideas are. Four days later, on December 8, 2021, General Rawat and 13 others with him, including his wife Madhulika, were killed in a helicopter crash in the Nilgiri Hills of Tamil Nadu while en route to the Defence Services Staff College in Wellington. Not just as a fine General , but as a mentor and friend, the death of General Bipin Rawat was a deep loss. For a time, Rahul and I wondered if we should pay tribute with a chapter on General Rawat’s own military operations as a younger officer. But we both agreed he wouldn’t have wanted the spotlight taken away from the officers and soldiers in his care. In the third book, we decided to include a chapter on Group Captain Varun Singh, Shaurya Chakra, the fighter pilot who was assigned as liaison to General Rawat on that final flight. The officer survived the crash, but succumbed to his injuries a week later. A copy of India’s Most Fearless 3 addressed to General Rawat remains in my house. I hope he finds the time to read it.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Apple has just wrapped up its annual developers’ conference, WWDC 2024, and now the next big thing on the cards is the launch of the iPhone 16 series. Expected to arrive in fall 2024, the next-gen iPhones are rumoured to bear some significant upgrades over their predecessors, especially the Pro variants. While we already know that Apple will be powering the iPhone 16 series with iOS 18, the Pro models are also expected to get the Apple Intelligence feature, a suite of AI features for its users. Other than iOS 18 and AI, Apple’s flagship lineup is speculated to bring design enhancements and improved performance. As always, Apple remains tight-lipped about the next-gen iPhone, but the internet is already filled with a flurry of leaks and rumours that have provided us with a glimpse of what to expect from the next iteration of the flagship device. Here is a brief summary of everything we know so far about the upcoming iPhone Pro models. Based on Apple’s historical launch patterns, the iPhone 16 Pro is likely to be unveiled in early September, possibly between 3 to 11 September with sales starting a week later. As for pricing the iPhone 16 Pro is anticipated to start at around $999 in the US. Notably, in India Apple launched its iPhone 15 series at a starting price of Rs 1,34,900. The iPhone 16 Pro is rumoured to feature a slightly larger 6.3-inch display, up from the 6.1-inch screen of its predecessor. This display is expected to be taller and narrower, with a 19.6:9 aspect ratio compared to the previous 19.5:9. Apple might also be employing a new Micro-Lens Array (MLA) OLED technology for this model, which would result in a screen that is 20 per cent brighter, potentially hitting 1,200 nits for standard brightness. In terms of design, the iPhone 16 Pro is expected to maintain the titanium frame introduced with the iPhone 15 Pro, but it could feature an even sleeker appearance with smaller 1.2mm bezels. The Face ID components might be hidden under the display, further enhancing the device's aesthetics. Additionally, continuing the trend set by the iPhone 15 Pro, the iPhone 16 Pro is also expected to retain the titanium frame and USB-C port. However, one of the most exciting rumours is the possible shift to capacitive buttons for the volume, power, and a new \"Capture\" button dedicated to camera functions. These solid-state buttons would replace traditional physical ones, providing a more durable and responsive user interface. Camera upgrades are always a focal point for new iPhones, and the iPhone 16 Pro will not be an exception. The main camera is rumoured to remain a 48-megapixel sensor, while the ultra-wide camera could see an upgrade to 48-megapixel from 12-megapixel. There are also reports of Apple planning to introduce a new periscope telephoto lens offering 5x optical zoom, a feature currently available only on the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Under the hood, the iPhone 16 Pro is expected to be powered by the new A18 Pro chipset, built on a 3-nanometer process, which promises better performance and efficiency. Paired with 8GB of RAM, this chipset will support the latest iOS 18 features, including enhanced AI capabilities for tasks like smart photo editing and more sophisticated Siri functionalities. The storage options might also see an upgrade, with the maximum capacity potentially reaching 2TB, double the current limit. This expansion is likely achieved through new, more compact, and cost-effective storage technologies. The device is also expected to support the latest Wi-Fi 7 and feature a new 5G modem for faster connectivity. The reports also suggest inclusion of a new thermal management system to prevent overheating, using graphene-based technology for better heat dissipation. The iPhone 16 Pro is rumoured to be available in Space Black, White, Gray, and a new Rose colour, replacing the previous Titanium Blue option. Apple might also introduce an improved finish process for the titanium body, resulting in a glossier and more scratch-resistant surface."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite 5G is all set to launch in India on June 24, which is tonight at 7PM. The company is promising to offer better performance with the new version in comparison to its predecessor, although leaks suggest that only a few areas will be upgraded with it retaining the old chip powering the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite. Ahead of the launch event, OnePlus has confirmed a few features and even revealed the design from all angles, so we have some official details about the upcoming 5G phone. The company is expected to livestream the event online via its YouTube channel. But, the link is yet to go live. Here is everything you need to know about the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite. The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is confirmed to offer a 5,500mAh battery supported by 80W fast charging technology. The device sports a 120Hz AMOLED display incorporating Aqua Touch technology, akin to the OnePlus 12R. This ensures functionality even with wet hands. The panel has a peak brightness of 2,100nits, which is the highest so far in its segment. Under the hood, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is rumoured to house the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, a chipset widely used by mid-range smartphones priced under Rs 20,000. This information aligns with recent Geekbench sightings. The device is expected to feature a 6.67-inch AMOLED screen operating at FHD+ resolution and could include a 50-megapixel primary rear camera alongside other sensors whose specifications remain undisclosed. On the front, it is likely to sport a 16-megapixel camera. Visually, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite will have subtle design changes. The official images have shown that the device will have a pill-shaped camera module with smaller sensors. It will come with a boxy design with a large display.. In terms of pricing, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite will likely be positioned around Rs 20,000 because the company is already selling its OnePlus Nord CE 4 smartphone at Rs 24,999. The new OnePlus phone will likely be available for purchase via Amazon and OnePlus India site."

As the flagship model in the Edge 50 series, the Edge 50 Ultra stands out from its predecessors, the Edge 50 Pro and Edge 50 Fusion, which were offered in vibrant Pantone shades. This time, Motorola has taken a different approach by introducing a unique wooden rear panel with a pleasant fragrance—a first for their smartphones. Let's dive into the details of its pricing and specifications. Motorola has launched the Edge 50 Ultra in India, priced at Rs 59,999 for the 12GB+512GB variant. There’s an introductory discount of Rs 5000, bringing the price down to Rs 54,999. Additionally, if you have an ICICI Bank or HDFC Bank card, you can get another Rs 5000 off.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Free keyboard cover Portable Good pricing Long battery life Keyboard isn’t sturdy Laptop wobbles on kickstand Average camera Honor recently made a comeback to the Indian market with the launch of its Honor x9b smartphone, which was followed by the launch of the Honor Pad 9 tablet. While the Honor x9b is a little underwhelming for a comeback phone, the Honor Pad 9 doesn’t seem to be getting its due credit that it deserves. I have been using the Honor Pad 9 for a couple of months and I think for its price –– Rs 22,999 with offer –– the tablet might be one of the best options available in the price segment. And if you are someone who is looking for a good Android alternative for an iPad that is also affordable, the Honor Tab 9 is the most sensible choice. One of the biggest attractions of the Honor Tab 9 is that on a sub-Rs 25,000 budget, you not only get a well-performing tablet, you also get a free Bluetooth keyboard with it, which is usually sold separately by most companies, or it is bundled in the more expensive models. For instance, OnePlus also has the OnePlus Pad Go that is priced almost similarly at Rs 23,999 but if you want to get a keyboard with it, you have to pay another Rs 1,399. I believe the bundling of the keyboard with the Honor Pad 9 really sweetens the deal. Before we get into the details about the Honor Pad 9, let’s quickly go through the basics of what the device is made of. The Honor Pad 9 has an impressive 12.1-inch display that offers a resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels, resulting in sharp visuals with a pixel density of 249 PPI. Powered by the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 Mobile Platform, the tablet ensures smooth performance with its octa-core processor. It includes four Cortex-A78 cores clocked at 2.2GHz and four Cortex-A55 cores clocked at 1.8GHz, balancing power efficiency and high-performance computing. The Adreno 710 GPU supports seamless graphics rendering for gaming and multimedia applications. In terms of photography, the Honor Pad 9 features an 8-megapixel front camera with an f/2.2 aperture for clear selfies and a 13-megapixel rear camera with an f/2.0 aperture and autofocus for sharp images and videos. It offers 8GB RAM and storage options of 128GB or 256GB, which can be expanded up to 1TB with a memory card, providing ample space for large files, media, and applications. Honor Pad 9 comes bundled with a free Bluetooth keyboard The Honor Pad 9 is probably one of the best Android tablets I have used in this price segment. I carried it around with me on a bunch of trips on both domestic and international routes. I was using it to get some basic work done. I prepared two Excel sheets on it, and I wrote 2-3 reviews on the tablet, and I watched a bunch of shows and movies on it. The tablet never gave me any issues in terms of multitasking or in its general performance. The tablet uses an IPS display that provides wide viewing angles and vibrant colours. I especially love that it’s a huge 12.1-inch display. The tablet features a brightness level of 500 nits and a contrast ratio of 1500:1, that ensures clear and bright visuals in various lighting conditions, including under direct sunlight. I have used the tablet in a well-lit office, in my low-lit bedroom, at an outdoor seating in a café, and in the indescribable lighting of an airport, and I never faced any legibility issue. Carrying the tab around is also pretty easy. The tablet itself doesn’t weigh much –– 555g. You can easily move around with the tab in your hand or a backpack. When you stick on the keyboard, that does add a little weight and a bit of bulk, but the overall weight still remains manageable. It feels like a slightly heavier book to be honest. The Honor Smart Bluetooth keyboard Since I mentioned watching a lot of videos and shows on the tablet, I also want to talk about the audio output of the tablet. The Honor Pad 9 uses eight speakers and a large sound cavity, delivering an immersive sound quality. The audio experience is dynamic and engaging. You only face a little issue when you blast the volume to full. That’s when you start to hear noise in the audio output. I honestly didn’t test out the camera of the Honor Pad 9 much, especially the rear one. I did click a picture here and there, and I think that’s how a tablet’s rear camera really ends up being used. For that purpose, the camera gets the work done. The front camera is also nothing special. Unless you are sitting in a well-lit room, you will not get a very good output during your video calls. All the experience of the Honor Pad 9 is well-supported by its battery. It has an 8,300mAh battery that is easily able to last a day and a half. I watched a whole season of Modern Family on the tablet in a go and I had still not exhausted the battery. The only downside is that despite a 35W fast charging adapter that comes with it, the tablet takes a while to charge. It takes a little over 2 hours to charge to full. What’s a little more annoying is that you have to charge the keyboard separately. So if you are in a hurry, it’s a hard choice you have to make, or plug both the tablet and the keyboard to separate chargers simultaneously. It’s not a pretty sight. Since we are talking about the keyboard. The Honor Pad 9 comes with a free Bluetooth keyboard, which is called the Smart Bluetooth keyboard. It has a toggle button on the right that lets you connect and disconnect from the keyboard easily. That also allows you to avoid any mistouches if you aren’t using the keyboard. The smart keyboard does not have any trackpad, so you have to use the display’s touch for the navigation, which you can’t do using the keys. Both the tab and the keyboard have separate Type-C charging points. The keyboard also has a toggle that helps you easily connect and disconnect it to the tablet. While the keyboard itself is a great accessory, especially at this price point, it has some flaws. The keys on it have a decent amount of travel but typing too vigorously on it makes the tablet wobble. So, you have to be gentle with typing. Even touching the tab screen while its is docked on the keyboard make the whole pad wobble, which is because the kickstand mechanism isn't very stable. Overall, though, the keyboard’s drawbacks aren’t exactly dealbreakers. It isn’t perfect, but it’s good, it gets the job done, it looks great, and at the top of it all, you don't have to pay for it separately. The Honor Pad 9 is a solid choice, and it is priced very well. At Rs 22,999, you get a decently well performing tablet, and along with it a free Bluetooth keyboard that doubles up as a cover for it. But, is the Honor Pad 9 perfect? No, it isn’t. The tablet has no fingerprint scanner, it charges quite slowly, it has a very average camera system, and it doesn’t sport a 3.5mm audio jack. However, despite that, I think the Honor Pad 9 makes for a decent choice because of the overall experience it offers, with a gorgeous display, a fantastic battery backup, and a stable performance."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Design and build Display Price Camera Battery This year, I have tested two Xiaomi flagships –– the Xiaomi 14 and Xiaomi 14 Ultra. Both smartphones have been impressive, especially when it comes to their display and camera. I have now been testing the third in the series, the Xiaomi 14 Civi. The smartphone is the most affordable in the Xiaomi 14 series, and is the cheapest smartphone to come with the Leica camera setup. After testing the phone for about two weeks, I can safely say that the Xiaomi 14 Civi gives you all the feel of a flagship, with a gorgeous display and an amazing point and shoot camera, while being much easier on the pocket. I call it an affordable flagship phone. When I shared my initial impressions of the Xiaomi 14 Civi, I wrote that the smartphone “feels like it has the good genes of both the Xiaomi 14 and Xiaomi 14 Ultra”, and a week later, I still believe that. I have been using the Xiaomi 14 Civi as my primary device for the past two weeks and I would easily recommend the device in the sub Rs 50,000 price segment. You can also read our interview with Xiaomi India CMO Anuj Sharma, who believes that with the Xiaomi 14 Civi in the sub-Rs 50K segment, the company has brought a gun to a knife fight. Coming back to the Xiaomi 14 Civi, in the two weeks of testing periods, I enjoyed the phone’s display, performance, and cameras, but what I have loved the most is its design and build. The phone’s battery life isn’t great but the 67W fast charger really makes up for it. Let’s dive into the details of the Xiaomi 14 Civi’s experience, but before that a quick summary on what powers the smartphone. Xiaomi 14 Civi comes in three colour variants. The Xiaomi 14 Civi is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, coupled with up to 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. The smartphone is significantly lighter than the Xiaomi 14 and 14 Ultra. It weighs just 177g and has a slim profile of 72.7mm in thickness. Photography is a standout feature of the Xiaomi 14 Civi. It uses Leica lenses and the Summilux lens also seen in the 14 and 14 Ultra. The triple camera setup includes a 50-megapixel main camera with a Light Hunter 800 image sensor, optical image stabilisation (OIS), and a 25mm equivalent focal length. The secondary camera is a 50-megapixel telephoto lens with a 50mm portrait focal length and 2x zoom. The third camera is a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens with a 120-degree field of view and a 15mm equivalent focal length. The rear cameras support HDR 4K recording at 30 fps and 4K videos at 24/30/60 fps. For selfies, the Xiaomi 14 Civi features a dual-camera setup with a 32-megapixel primary camera and a 32-megapixel ultra-wide camera. The front cameras also support 4K recording at 30 fps, Night mode, HDR, and other modes. The device is powered by a 4,700mAh battery with 67W fast charging support. It also includes a dedicated cooling system called the Xiaomi IceLoop system. Additional features include an in-screen fingerprint sensor, AI face unlock, Bluetooth 5.4, Wi-Fi 6, and NFC support. The Xiaomi 14 Civi has great one-hand usability With the Xiaomi 14 Civi, I have experienced the joy of using a smartphone that is compact yet gives you a large enough display, and it’s light and sleek, yet it doesn’t compromise on camera or battery. The smartphone has great one-hand usability. I have the matcha green variant, which looks nice. The rear panel on my variant is part faux leather, which reminds me of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra. The other part is a wood-pressed mother of pearl-like finish, which is also unique to each matcha green variant unit. The device has a circular camera module, which is distinct, and again reminds you of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra design. However, what stands out in terms of design — besides how light the device is — is the display. The smartphone has a quad curved display, which is apparently a world’s first. But what you really need to know is that the Xiaomi 14 Civi’s display has the best of both the worlds of a curved display and a flat display. It has no distortions like in a flat display, and has the better usability of a curved display. It helps you avoid mistouch, while giving you thinner bezels. The display itself is gorgeous. It is bright and has crisp colours. Watching social media content or a show or movie on the phone is pure bliss. The display colours remain just as vibrant even when you use it outdoors on a bright sunny day. I used the phone on 120Hz refresh rate settings and I found the responsiveness of the display and the animations were snappy. That was also the general experience regarding the performance of the smartphone. Through the 15-day testing of the device, I did not experience any lag in the device’s performance. I was using multiple apps at the same time, I was multitasking and switching between them, I had a number of apps running in the background, yet there were no lags or heating issues that I faced. The Xiaomi 14 Civi is sleek and lightweight When charging the device and while gaming, I did notice it heating up slightly, but it was never hot enough to make me want to stop using it. Naturally, when testing for device's heating issues, I chose not to test it outdoors; in this Delhi heatwave, you can't blame a device for heating up a little. My testing was done indoors in air-conditioned environments. That said, while carrying the phone around with me outside, and cool when I was out, I also did not heat up the phone. In general, any minor heating issue quickly cooled down. Which is great. The Xiaomi 14 Civi’s battery isn’t as long-lasting as I had hoped. It gets me through the day, but I have to almost always charge the device by the end of the day –– that’s with moderate usage. With heavy usage, you may have to charge a little sooner than that. I kept a record of the phone’s battery performance as well. On June 13, my phone was at 7 per cent battery at 4.11 PM. I plugged it in for charging and it reached 100 per cent by around 4.45 PM. I went home and I scrolled through a bit of social media, made a few calls, one of which was also a WhatsApp video call, and by the time I came to office the next day, at 10.39 AM the phone’s battery level was at 10 per cent again. That dropped to 8 per cent by 11.09 AM. However, what really makes up for the average battery performance of the device is the 67W fast charging adapter that comes in the box. I was able to fuel the phone from 0 to 100 per cent in about 42 minutes. As for the user experience, HyperOS is a much improved interface than the MIUI. It's much cleaner and lighter. It's not free of bloatware for sure, bit it allows a lot more customisations. Which means, spending a few minutes with the device to personalise it, will give you a much better user interface. Compared to MIUI, the HyperOS is also a lot more intuitive. Personally, I am quite happy with the improvements that come in the user experience with HyperOS. The Xiaomi 14 Civi features a triple camera setup Coming to the highlight of the Xiaomi 14 Civi –– the camera. The Xiaomi 14 Civi has a fantastic camera setup. Just like the Xiaomi 14 and Xiaomi 14 Ultra, you can still just point and shoot your images. The shutter speed is fast, even when you are clicking in 50mm mode. Similar to the Xiaomi 14 and Xiaomi 14 Ultra, you can also choose to click in either Leica Vibrant or Leica Authentic mode on the 14 Civi. I chose the latter. It gives you more true to life colours in the images. Vibrant gives you more ready-for-social media images that are vibrant and have little over the top colours in the images. The images are sharp and well in focus, nevertheless. However, in the portrait mode in low-light, you can sometimes see the focus to be softer than you would like. The edge detection, though, is good. The smartphone’s camera also does some AI post-processing which also adds a bit of sharpness to images, which I don’t mind at all. I think for an average user, the Xiaomi 14 Civi’s camera makes photography very simple. As long as you have your subject locked in, the phone’s camera does most of the heavy lifting, both on the hardware and software level. For selfies, the phone's camera uses a dual 32-megapixel camera. On most occasions, the phone clicks great selfies, except in low-light portraits. The phone struggles a little there sometimes. But largely, you will get good, Insta-ready selfies on the phone. The Xiaomi 14 Civi is a fantastic choice in the sub-Rs 50,000 budget. The only pain point of the device is its battery life, but the fast charger quickly makes up for it. Besides that, the device has a beautiful display, a light and handy design, and a great set of cameras, and one of the best things about the smartphone is its pricing. The smartphone has a very competitive price that starts at Rs 42,999 for the base variant. It goes up to Rs 50,999. With bank offers or exchange, customers can buy the device at a starting price of Rs 39,999. But there’s another thing going in favour of the smartphone. There aren’t a lot of good alternatives in this price segment either. There is the OnePlus 12R, and the Nothing Phone 2. But that’s it. So, if you are looking for a smartphone between Rs 40,000 to Rs 45,000, the Xiaomi 14 Civi is one of the best options out there."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Just last month over here at India Today Tech, we reviewed Lenovo's latest convertible — the Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 laptop . It was a good laptop but is there anything better as well? Sure, said Lenovo. And sent us a beefed up Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i, which is a regular laptop and not a convertible, so that we can take a closer look at it. It’s indeed much more powerful and surely a better package than that convertible, although it also costs a little bit more. This new laptop too belongs to the Yoga series. But it does not do all the crazy convertible stuff. Instead, it offers top performance with the power of the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, a new processor that uses Intel’s latest CPU architecture. And not just a top CPU, but the Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i also comes with a discrete graphics card from Nvidia. You see, the Yoga Pro 7i has the RTX GeForce 4050 inside it. Essentially, and at least on paper, the Yoga Pro 7i is a laptop meant for those who work hard and play harder. This is because it has a place in an office, but due to its graphics card it is also capable of handling some casual gaming with ease. The rest of the hardware too is fairly capable. The question, however, is if the entirety of it — the all of Yoga Pro 7i — can it justify its rather hefty starting price of Rs 1.5 lakh. And on that aspect I am not entirely certain. But about that in my conclusion. First a quick run through the specs: The Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i drives its power from the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H and is complemented by the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 with 6GB VRAM. The unit I am reviewing comes with 32GB RAM and 1TB storage. The screen of the laptop measures 14.5 inches. It is also a brilliant screen due to its OLED panel and fairly high resolution of 2880x1800 pixels. It supports 120Hz refresh rate. The software is Windows 11 Home Edition, and Lenovo has bundled Office Home & Student with it, although the Office suite needs to be activated. The Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i looks similar to the Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 that I reviewed earlier. It has the same aluminium build, which I find okay and not exactly as solid as I have noticed on Apple laptops. It has a similar Teal Blue colour and it weighs around 2 kg. The speaker grills are on the side of the keyboard. The only big difference is that you cannot fold the screen 360 degrees to use it as a tablet. However, it is from the Yoga family so it does offer some flexibility by laying flat at 180 degrees. Of course, this is a slightly bigger laptop and that does mean there are a few other changes. For example, ahem, on the port side. On the right, there is one USB 2.0 port, one 3-mm audio jack port, and the power button. On the right there is also a unique camera button, which can be toggled to electronically switch on and switch off the front camera. Privacy-minded users will appreciate it. On the left, there is an HDMI port and two USB-C ports. Though I would have liked to see more ports, particularly one more USB-C port, and more on the right, because it would have added some more convenience for a user. After all, one of the USB-C ports is anyway occupied by the charger. Design and build-wise, the Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i looks sturdy and premium and is easy to carry around everywhere. I used it as my primary work device for over a week, doing my work on it in the office carrying it all around my house as I browsed on it or watched something on it, and didn’t find it bothersome at all. Display is one of the best parts of the Yoga Pro 7i. Its 14.5-inch OLED display offers up to a 120Hz refresh rate, up to 2880x1800 resolution, and 10-bit colour depth, something that allows Lenovo to offers users 100 per cent P3 colour coverage as well as support for Dolby Vision. Beyond the technical buzzwords and jargons: it is a mighty fine display. It shows brilliant colours, as OLED panels tend to do, and its up to 400nits of peak brightness ensures the screen is not reflective even in well-lit rooms or outdoors. I watched a lot of YouTube videos and streamed Netflix shows on the Yoga Pro 7i and I really enjoyed the viewing experience it offers. It's clear, crisp, and balanced equally from all viewing angles. The display can also lay flat at 180 degrees. Though I don't really see the practical use of this flexibility, it does save me from the scare I usually get with other laptops whenever I accidentally tend to push the screen a bit too much while opening the lid. The Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i is all about performance, and with the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H paired with the Nvidia graphics card, it does a good job. I used the laptop for work, juggling between CMS, documents, YouTube — music is important— and even the AI powers of Copilot, as it is one of the latest Windows laptops to come with a dedicated Copilot button. The laptop chugs along merrily irrespective of what you are doing on it. It’s smooth and fuss-free. I even played some games like GTA 5 — a little old but still fairly demanding — and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 allowed me to play at the highest settings. Though the 4050 is not the fastest, it does a decent job, demonstrating that the Yoga Pro 7i can handle those sudden gaming urges if you are into games. Just to put it in some perspective I ran a few basic benchmarks on the laptop. In Cinebench 24, the single-core score for the 155H — and single-core is the more important one — was 101 points, which theoretically makes the laptop almost as fast as an extremely high-end desktop from one to two years ago. Not bad at all. Similarly, the RTX 4060 in the scores around 6500 points in the GPU test, which too is fairly respectable given that this is similar to desktop-class GPUs from a few years ago. In GeekBench, the Yoga Pro 7i got 2099 points in single core and 12347 points in the multi-core test. On the GPU side it scored close to 63000 points. What does this mean? It means that some of the laptop chipsets like Apple M3 are still faster, particularly in important single-core performance, but the Intel 155H and Nvidia RTX 4050 is fast enough to make for a very potent combination, the kind of combination that one can almost call desktop-class. In terms of performance, one thing I did not like that much. The heat and the fan noise. In regular, day to day use, the laptop is fine. It runs cool and quiet. But if you are playing games on it, or doing something strenuous like running Cinebench, it can heat up and its fans start spinning like a mini tornado. And they make enough noise to be audible to your office colleagues sitting a metre away from you. Just like the display, I also loved the keyboard in the Yoga Pro 7i. It is tactile and I liked typing on it — given that I type around 3000 to 4000 words daily. Not once did I feel strain on my fingers. The keyboard offers 3 settings of backlighting— auto, low, and high — so it was easy to work in dimly lit environments or even at night after turning off the lights. Last time when I reviewed a Lenovo laptop, one of my grouses was its trackpad. Well, not with the Yoga Pro 7i. I love the trackpad in this laptop — it is large, smooth and it tracks the fingers and gestures quickly and accurately. Oh, but the speakers! This is one bit I found middling or rather average in the Yoga Pro 7i. Under the hood, the Yoga Pro 7i offers Dolby Atmos-powered speakers — there are 4 of them — but they do only an okay job. In fact, while playing music or streaming videos, the audio output feels screechy at higher volumes and not at all pleasant. Talking of volume, they don’t go very loud. If you are using a window AC like I do at home and if you sit near it to watch a movie on the Yoga Pro 7i, you would do better to route the audio through a headphone or an external speaker. Given that this is a laptop with powerful hardware, it does sips through the battery rather quickly. In my regular use, I mostly found that it would give me around 3 to 4 hours of battery life, which is on the lower side. But thankfully, there is faster charging support in the laptop. It comes with a 140W charger, which powers it from 0 to 100 within an hour, which is very fast and obviously convenient. This is somewhat of a tricky question because you see the Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i is a jack of all, master of none. It’s an all-purpose laptop but it does have its share of weaknesses, which kind of leaves it neither here nor there. You see, if you want a laptop for long battery life and work, there are better choices available. Similarly if you want something for gaming, there are better choices available. Still, if you are looking for a powerful laptop that will work as your office and work companion, and yet it is a laptop on which you can fire up Steam to play a game or two, you should take a look at the Yoga Pro 7i. I wish it had a better set of speakers and better battery life, but at the same time I also admire its great display, well-built keyboard and smooth trackpad. In other words, like any other laptop out in the market the Yoga Pro 7i too is a mixed bag. Its price also doesn’t help it because Rs 1.5 lakh is a lot of money, which pits the Yoga Pro 7i against formidable machines like MacBook Air 15. Yet, if you are looking for a powerful and do-it-all Windows laptop, you should take a closer look at it."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Realme GT series made a comeback in India in May with the GT 6T. The GT series has been synonymous with functionality and style. When Realme sent over the GT 6T for review, I was excited to see what this latest iteration brought to the table. The Realme GT 6T is packed with high-end features and performance that you would typically expect from a much more expensive device. Having spent a significant amount of time with it, I can confidently say it offers a well-rounded experience with some standout features. Here is my detailed review of the Realme GT 6T. Before you think the Realme GT 6T has a regular mirror on the back, hold up. It does, but not quite the way you would imagine. The phone sports a sleek design with squarish edges and a reflective panel on the rear, which Realme dubs as the “nano mirror” design. This panel is silver, giving off serious stainless-steel vibes –– it’s so reflective you could practically check your makeup or set your eyeliner by simply looking at the camera island. The mix of matte and shiny metal textures adds a touch of sophistication. Apart from the Fluid Silver, the phone also comes in a striking Razor Green colourway. While it looks great and feels premium, it's also a magnet for fingerprints, smudges, and scratches. The soft matte finish on the rear attracts fingerprints like crazy, and the upper part highlighting the camera sensors is prone to scratches. I have been using the device for almost a month, and I can already see a bunch of scratches. So, make sure to use the case provided in the box to keep your phone smudge and scratch-free. The two camera sensors on the back are hanging out solo with no pill-shaped or square module to house them, something we usually see on smartphones these days. There's also an LED sensor, standing proudly next to the vertically stacked cameras. Overall, it's a big phone but surprisingly slim, so it slides into your pocket with ease. Despite its size, it’s lightweight enough that you won’t feel like you’re carrying a brick. The volume and power buttons are conveniently placed on the right, making them easy to reach. The Realme GT 6T's display is where it truly shines—literally. The AMOLED screen with a resolution of FHD+ 2780x1264 is stunning. Colours pop and images are razor-sharp. The 120Hz refresh rate makes everything look buttery smooth, from scrolling through social media to playing games. I watched movies, played games, and I have to say, this phone is perfect for people who travel a lot and love watching movies on the go. It has dual speakers that deliver punchy sound output, and it can get pretty loud. Whether you're watching movies, binge-watching web shows, or gaming on the go, the experience is top-notch. The picture quality is vibrant, and at max settings, it gets super bright indoors, considering it offers a peak brightness of 6,000 nits. But thanks to that brightness, it is also a breeze to read stuff on the device directly under the scorching Delhi sun. No squinting or struggling to see the screen at all! You can also customise the screen settings easily. One of the standout features of the Realme GT 6T is its performance, thanks to the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 chipset. This chipset is an absolute beast, handling everything I threw at it with ease. Whether I was multitasking, playing intensive mobile games, or just browsing through apps, the phone never lagged. Load times were lightning-fast, and switching between apps was seamless. As for benchmarking scores, the phone scored 1858 in the single-core test and 4772 in the multi-core test. These high scores translated to excellent real-time performance too. I regularly played Asphalt 9 for a solid 30 minutes at a stretch and never encountered any lags or heating issues. The phone stayed cool to the touch, only getting slightly warm during intensive tests like PCMark and Geekbench. I have been using the Realme GT 6T for about a month for my daily tasks, which include browsing social media, clicking pictures, and watching movies. So far, I haven't faced any issues. Coming to the software bit, the phone runs on Realme UI 5.0 based on Android 14. The interface is clean and user-friendly, with plenty of customisation options. There are a few pre-installed apps– Realme has not gotten rid of bloatware entirely but I was happy to not find the usual Hot games and Hot apps here. Having said that, the preloaded apps are not overly intrusive, and most can be uninstalled. The software experience is smooth, and Realme has added some nifty features that enhance usability. Battery life is crucial for any smartphone user, and the Realme GT 6T delivers. The 5,500mAh battery easily lasts through a full day of heavy usage. Whether I was gaming, streaming videos, or just browsing the web, I never had to worry about running out of juice. I put the phone through the PCMark battery test. Starting with about 80 percent battery, the test ran continuously for 9 hours and 12 minutes until it hit 20 percent. In my opinion, that’s impressive for a midrange smartphone battery. The Realme GT 6T also comes with a 120W SUPERVOOC charging. This technology charged the phone from 0 to 100 per cent in about 25 minutes. It’s incredibly convenient for when you’re in a hurry and need a quick power boost. Additionally, the phone also comes with AI Smart Charging that adjusts the charging speed based on your usage patterns, which helps in preserving battery health. The GT 6T has a versatile camera setup. The main 50-megapixel sensor captures detailed and vibrant photos. In daylight, the images are sharp with natural colours, similar to what most smartphone cameras can do nowadays. When it comes to portrait shots, the background is nicely blurred, creating a pleasant bokeh effect. However, the edge detection isn't quite perfect. If you zoom in on a picture, you will notice that the subject looks more like a cutout. You won't get the same quality of portrait shots as you would from most flagship and even mid-range phones. The poor edge detection, I believe, is owing to the slow shutter speed. The camera also has stability issues especially if you move too close to the subject or zoom in on it. The low-light pictures are decent, a fair deal of detail is conserved even in low-light pictures. The ultra-wide lens is handy for capturing expansive shots, the images I captured using the ultra wide mode fair amount of details, especially when the picture was captured in good lighting condition. The colour reproduction was also fairly accurate. There is no dedicated telephoto lens. However, you can go closer to the subject using the zoom lens but the stabilty remains an issue. If you keep your hands stable, the pictures can turn out to be nice. The selfie camera performs decently. It captures fairly accurate skin tone, but sometimes the camera tends to soften the skin tone, meaning your pimples and blemishes will all be hidden by the camera. Should you buy the Realme GT 6T? My experience with the Realme GT 6T has been positive. It’s a phone that offers flagship-level performance at a more accessible price point of Rs 32,999. The combination of its powerful Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 chipset, stunning display, sleek design, and long-lasting battery makes it a top contender in the mid-range smartphone market. There are a few hiccups here and there but nothing that cannot be overlooked. And if you can shell out a little more money, with bank offers included, you can get the Realme GT 6 at a starting price of Rs 35,999, that will offer a more powerful chipset, AI features, and a really good battery."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The wireless earphone market is already saturated with countless options, catering to different needs of users. While not all of them offer value for money, the new Motif II ANC from Marshall promises to offer a premium sound experience to users under Rs 20,000. Marshall -- which is known for its iconic amplifiers -- has introduced this pair of new earphones with a pleasing design, ANC support, 30 hours of playtime and more. But at Rs 19,999, is the Marshall Motif II ANC worth buying? Let's find out in this review. Marshall is known for offering stylish audio products and the new Motif II ANC is no different. It aims to woo users with its aesthetic appeal. At first glance, it looks unique with its leather texture, but the excitement dies down quickly when you touch the earbuds case because of its plastic build. It feels underwhelming, especially considering the premium price it is selling at. If you put the but about the plastic build aside, the case’s crushed-paper pattern in a textured finish is both visually appealing and practical, offering a good grip and making it less prone to showing fingerprints or scratches. However, despite its premium look, the case's plastic build doesn’t quite match the high expectations set by its design. It doesn't have a metallic hinge either. While the case offers a satisfying sound when opened or closed, it doesn’t come with solid build quality that anyone would expect from a product in its price range. It comes only in black colour, which looks nice. The compact case and the lightweight design make it easier to carry and tuck in a jeans’ pocket. I liked that the case features a pairing button for easy connectivity, complemented by a tiny LED light indicating the battery status. The earphones fit well in my ears and I had no issues using them for 3-4 hours at a stretch. However, people who are interested in buying these earphones should first try it in offline stores as everyone has a different ear canal shape and it may not be a good fit for everyone, something that also happened with one of my colleagues while using it. While I had no trouble using it, the earbuds gave a bit of trouble to my colleague when it started to hurt her ear even after wearing the buds briefly. The Marshall Motif II ANC is water resistant up to a certain level, with the earphones having an IPX5 rating and the case featuring an IPX4 rating. They can handle water splashes, but one should avoid using them during rain to avoid damaging them. The earbuds support touch controls and one can control music/ANC using them. The touch panels are mostly responsive and there were rare occurrences of any errors. However, there are limited options to change touch controls. Also, there is no multi-device pairing feature, which allows you to be connected to both phone and laptop at the same time. The Marshall Motif II ANC earbuds offer a balanced audio profile with well-defined mids and treble. The bass, while present, is more subtle and does not overpower the mix. The soundstage is moderately spacious, delivering good instrument separation and depth. While they excel in clarity and balance, those who love a deep, driving bass may find the low-end response a bit restrained. The Marshall earbuds has support for Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), which blocks out most of the background noise and I am able to enjoy my music peacefully in the office. However, I have to mention that when travelling in a cab with windows down, the ANC is not able to completely cut the noises of construction machines, or crying babies. While travelling, I enabled Transparency mode to be aware of my surroundings and it works well. Marshall has added support for the in-ear detection feature too and it works well when I need to talk to someone and take out my earphones from my ears. Similarly, the call quality is also great and I heard from people that they were able to hear me clearly without any issues. The issue was only when I was in a very noisy environment and the voice was a bit muffled, but this happens with several wireless earphones. The Motif II ANC’s sound experience is good, but the Marshall app’s performance leaves room for improvement. The pairing process is often sluggish, with issues in terms of loading the pairing page and connecting the earphones to the devices. Moreover, there have been rare but annoying instances of the earbuds disconnecting unexpectedly during use. But, this is something that can be fixed with a software update. On the positive side, the app’s interface is straightforward and easy to navigate. There are options for adjusting ANC and touch controls. One can also use the app's built-in equaliser to customise their listening experience, and the details for the battery status are also available. So, most of the key functionalities are there in the app, and the only issue is that it operates at a very slow pace. One of the solid traits of the Marshall Motif II ANC is its battery life. The wireless earbuds easily lasted for 4 days with ANC enabled. I used it for 3 hours every day to listen to music and for calls as well. With ANC disabled, it can last for 5 days easily. The case has support for wireless charging but because it takes a lot of time to charge, I mostly used my smartphone's wired charger to top up the battery quickly. The Marshall Motif II ANC is a decent pair of wireless earphones that you can consider buying if you are looking for balanced output. People who want a thumping bass experience will have to look for other options. While the build quality is not the best in its price range, the latest Marshall earphones offer an attractive design, solid battery life, an app with important features and good ANC. One can also consider buying Sony WF-1000 XM5 earphones for a slightly better sound quality in a similar price range or go for Nothing Ear 2 if the budget is around Rs 12,000."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Realme is gearing up for the next launch of the season, Realme C61. According to the leaks, the smartphone will hit the Indian and the global market soon. The details of the device, including specifications and pricing, have also been leaked online. As per the report, published by PassionateGeekz , the Realme C61 is expected to feature a rear camera island, which looks similar to the premium models of iPhone 15. Colour options are expected to vary by region. In India, the speculation about the colours is such that the device will come in Marble Black and Safari Green options, while international markets might see Dark Green and Dark Black options. While the company has not announced any details yet, the expectations and rumours are already making rounds on social media. As the pricing is concerned, according to the leak, the Realme C61 is estimated to cost near to EUR 130 for international markets. This price range then translates to around Rs 10,000 in India. Under the hood, the device is rumoured to be powered by a Unisoc Speedtrum T612 chipset, a 4G-only processor. This will be paired with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM, alongside storage options of up to 128 GB. The display of Realme C61 is expected to sport an HD+ resolution of 1600 x 720 pixels with a pixel density of 320 DPI. The leak suggests that the device has received the certifications of IP54 water resistance and a rain-sensitive smart touch. The device has also received Realme Lab High dependency certification, as per the leak, but the exact functionality of the feature remains unclear. The device is also expected to feature a programmable dynamic button and support air gestures. For camera enthusiasts, the Realme C61 is most likely to enter the market featuring a 50-megapixel main sensor on the back. It has also been assumed that the smartphone might sport a 5,000mAH battery. This will be backed by 45W fast charging support, allowing for quicker power top-ups. These specifications and price range of the Realme C61 are based on rumours and leaks. Till the company makes an official announcement, we advise you to take these with a pinch of salt. As the company has recently launched its latest GT series flagship globally, it looks like Realme will be focusing on the series. According to the rumours, Realme has plans to launch at least two GT-series smartphones every year. One of these will include a ‘Pro’ model, which will most likely be a flagship offering from Realme, according to GSMArena . The brand has already confirmed the Realme GT 7 Pro will launch globally and in India by the end of this year."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Oppo A3 Pro has been launched in India under Rs 20,000. The company is claiming that its new mid-range phone is damage-proof, water resistant up to a certain level and people also get a premium design. Oppo says its new A-series smartphone also comes with a few AI features as well. Here is everything you need to know. The Oppo A3 Pro is priced at Rs 17,999 for 128GB storage model and Rs 19,999 for the 256GB variant. It can be purchased via Amazon, Flipkart, OPPO Store, and mainline retail outlets. As part of the launch, one can get up to 10 per cent instant cashback on credit and debit cards from HDFC Bank, SBI Cards, IDFC First Bank, Yes Bank, and ICICI Bank. The newly launched Oppo A3 Pro smartphone is IP54 certified, so it can handle water splashes. The device comes with Splash Touch technology, so the device will remain functional even when used with wet hands. It has features like AI LinkBoost and AI Eraser, the functionality of both the devices is currently unknown. The eraser might be for removing unwanted objects or elements from a picture, as has been the case with other devices. The company says that the new Oppo A3 Pro is damage-proof as it has an \"Armour Body\" and features a new internal structure and a suite of drop-resistant materials like Blue Glass double-tempered glass for the screen. Key components inside the phone are also cushioned with a Biomimetic Sponge for shock absorption. The A3 Pro has also received SGS Drop-Resistance Certification (Standard) and SGS Military Standard Certification for its rugged nature. Under the hood, there is a 5,100mAh battery with support for 45W charging. The company is bundling the fast charger along with its smartphone, unlike a few other brands. It is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset under the hood. The handset packs a 6.67-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate and a maximum brightness of 1,000nits in sunlight. There is a 50-megapixel dual rear camera setup and an 8-megapixel selfie camera on the front."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story More than a year ago, Linda Yaccarino took charge as X (earlier called Twitter) CEO and has often made headlines. Upon her appointment as the new CEO of X, Yaccarino had expressed excitement over her new project and had said that he was an inspirational figure for her. However, a Financial Times report now says that Yaccarino is being pressurised into cutting costs and boosting revenue at X. The report says that Yaccarino has recently made bold moves within her executive team as result of the pressure from Musk. This strategic shake-up includes the dismissal of Joe Benarroch, her right-hand man and the head of business operations and communications, according to sources familiar with the matter. According to the Financial Times, Benarroch was held accountable for mishandling the rollout of a new adult content policy. This failure, which involved not informing clients of the changes before they became public, was a key factor in his departure, as stated by two employees of X. For the unversed, Benarroch joined X in June 2023 after a stint at Comcast's NBCUniversal where he reported directly to Yaccarino. This leadership restructuring reportedly comes at a time of growing tension between Musk and Yaccarino. The X CEO, who was recruited from NBCUniversal by Musk, is under intense pressure to stabilize X’s financial health. Sources within the company told Financial Times that Yaccarino has been particularly anxious about meeting Musk’s demands to increase revenue and reduce expenses. This has involved making cuts to the US and UK sales teams and trimming expenditures on items such as travel. Recently, details of an all-hands meeting at X had surfaced in media reports. The meeting was headed by Yaccarino, and she reportedly told employees to promote Musk's recent venture x.AI but didn't talk much about X's advertising business performance during a recent all-hands meeting. A report in The Verge had said that employees wanted to know about the company’s performance reviews amid growing concerns during the meeting. The promotions process at X, as per the report, has been delayed without explanation. In addition to this, X’s sales team was not expecting to meet its revenue targets for the quarter, according to insiders. Moreover, a source at X also told the publication that the company had also laid off a \"handful\" of people recently. Sources also told The Verge that Steve Davis, CEO of The Boring Company and one of Musk’s close associates, has been scrutinising the finances at X's San Francisco headquarters for several weeks. This caused further anxiety amongst the staff. In such a scenario, employees wanted more clarity about the company's performance review process as well as the business performance of X during the all-hands meeting led by the X CEO. However, The Verge report said that the employees didn't hear enough about these points. Another report by The New York Times revealed that even though Yaccarino talked about X's advertising business, she did not share \"updated sales figures\". Yaccarino reportedly told employees that X saw 65 percent of advertisers returning to the platform. However, sources told The New York Times that the return of advertisers doesn't necessarily mean a revenue increase."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Artificial Intelligence (AI) isn't just a buzzword any more, it touches almost every aspect of our lives. From how we use social media, to how we receive healthcare, AI is making things faster, better, and in some cases, cheaper. I was recently at Imagine 2024 in Austin, Texas where I sat down with Mihir Shukla, CEO of Automation Anywhere, to talk about the real-world impact of AI and how it's changing how we work and use technology. A lot of the AI we see today exists in smartphones. On the surface level, most of the AI we see is in the form of image/video-editing tools and generative AI solutions like Gemini and ChatGPT, however, there’s a lot more to it. Mihir believes that AI is already all around us, embedded in the services we use every day. \"Think about any service you consume from a large company, whether it's banking, healthcare, or transportation,\" he says. AI is working behind the scenes to enhance these services, making them more efficient and user-friendly. Take car troubles, for example. Instead of taking a day off to visit a mechanic, AI can diagnose the issue over a call and find the nearest service provider, making a frustrating experience seamless. While we experience AI in our daily lives, many of us are unaware of how it works in the backend to ensure a smooth experience whenever we interact with technology. AI isn't just about making our lives easier; it has the potential to save lives, too. Mihir is particularly excited about how AI can revolutionise healthcare. Imagine using AI to analyse your health data and predict potential risks. \"You could send your health information to a hospital, which could then use AI to alert you to a heart risk within the next 48 hours,\" he explained. This kind of application could fundamentally transform healthcare and save thousands of lives. During the conversation, we touched upon an interesting topic about who will control AI in the future. Since the advent of technology, the majority of control has been in the hands of a few companies, namely Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple. Could AI have the same fate? Despite its benefits, AI's rapid growth has sparked concerns about market dominance by a few key players. Mihir acknowledged that companies like Nvidia currently lead the AI infrastructure market, but he sees this as just the beginning. \"Innovation can happen anywhere in the world,\" he asserted, suggesting that the real breakthroughs will come from the applications and solutions built on top of existing infrastructure. The future of AI, he believes, will be shaped by businesses around the globe developing new and innovative uses for the technology. While other chipset manufacturers like Qualcomm, Intel and MediaTek have also been trying to develop more AI-enabled solutions for various products, Nvidia is currently winning that race. According to a report by the International Trade Administration, the AI market in India is projected to reach $8 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of over 40 from 2020 to 2025. While OpenAI’s Sam Altman doesn’t want to bet his money on India making its functional AI model like ChatGPT, Mihir believes that with its immense talent pool, India should seek to develop solutions beyond the functional AI model. He believes that India should use its resources to develop new solutions rather than spend time on applications that have already been developed by other companies. When it comes to India, Mihir sees immense potential for the country to harness AI and gain a competitive edge. He believes that the lack of strict digital policies shouldn't deter businesses from using AI to improve their operations. \"This is an opportunity for nations to embrace this technology and become so competitive that they can capture larger market shares,\" he said. For Mihir, the ability to innovate quickly is crucial for any country looking to lead in an AI-driven world. He also urged that instead of focusing on creating tools that already exist in the market (like ChatGPT), India should focus more on creating AI tools that will be useful two years from now. “Why would you spend time creating another functional AI tool that already exists? I think you should create something that is needed in the future that will be required two years from now.”, Mihir added. As AI continues to evolve, it's natural to wonder about the compromises we might have to make. Mihir acknowledges that significant changes often come at a cost, with some people feeling left behind or nostalgic for simpler times. There could be many not wanting to adopt new technologies and are comfortable with legacy methods. This could prove to be a challenge when it comes to adoption of new-age tech like AI. However, he believes that the benefits of AI far outweigh the downsides if we manage the transition thoughtfully. \"This kind of change is about leadership,\" he said. \"If leaders engage with this technology and harness its power, they can accelerate progress and bring immense benefits to their employees, countries, and society at large.\" Of course, AI isn't without its risks and challenges. Privacy and data security are major concerns when dealing with large amounts of user data, especially when tech stalwarts like Elon Musk have raised alarms citing the misuse of A. Musk even highlighted certain risks for iPhone users after Apple announced that it's partnering with ChatGPT for its AI solutions. Though, there is no proof to back Musk’s claims. Mihir stresses the importance of trust in the brands managing our data. He believes that companies like Apple and OpenAI are committed to protecting user data, and as long as they continue to do so, they will maintain consumer trust. He also emphasised the need for a balanced view, advocating for careful management of AI's risks while still engaging with the technology. Looking to the future, Mihir encourages businesses and nations to focus on creating new AI applications rather than replicating existing ones. He draws a parallel to the Second Industrial Revolution, where countries that embraced new technologies thrived, while those that resisted change fell behind. \"We should think about where the puck is going, not where it has already been,\" he advised. By focusing on future opportunities and leveraging AI to address unmet needs, businesses can drive innovation and achieve significant returns. To conclude, AI is transforming our world in profound ways. As Mihir Shukla emphasises, the key to harnessing this power lies in leadership, innovation, and a forward-thinking approach. By embracing AI and leveraging its potential, businesses and nations can create a better, more efficient world. However, it is crucial to manage this transition carefully, address ethical concerns, and ensure that the benefits of AI are shared broadly. The future of AI holds immense promise, and those who navigate its challenges thoughtfully will be well-positioned to reap its rewards."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Like they say, anything can happen in the Elonverse. Elon Musk’s X seems to be changing once again, and unfortunately, not for the better. Musk announced on Tuesday that X will soon charge new users for using the most basic Twitter functionalities, such as posting, liking, bookmarking, or even retweeting a post. This will come at a \"small fee\" of $1 annually (which is about Rs 100). The feature was tested in New Zealand and the Philippines, and Musk now plans to roll it out globally. Essentially, this means that for new users, accessing the most basic functionalities on the platform will soon become a paid privilege. Musk says the move is meant to “curb the relentless onslaught of bots”. He states, “current AI (and troll farms) can pass the 'are you a bot' test with ease”. However, we have a few questions for Musk: Does paying a dollar really ensure that you are not a bot? Can the people behind these AI bots and troll farms not afford the $1 fee? And what happens to the existing bots and troll farms on the platform? Another question arises (and arguably a more important one): Does this not ruin a new user’s experience? Charging users the $1 fee means limiting their ability to experience the platform as we know it. It will also restrict the ability of a user to quickly and accurately spread crucial information or reach other users. If you are not paying the $1 fee, it means you can only consume content on the platform without being able to contribute to it. When X started testing this feature in October 2023, Musk confirmed that the model would allow users to \"read for free, but [they would have to pay] $1/year to write.\" The X chief believes that this is the \"only way to fight bots without blocking real users.\" However, we are not sure of that. Restricting the usual access to the platform’s functionalities for new users implies a disparity in the user experience on X. According to Musk, a user like myself, who has been on the platform for over a decade, can use the basic functionalities –– although I too need to pay for features like an edit button, no-ads, or the ability to write a long post. However, for a new user, X will be a read-only platform, similar to browsing Google News. However, we wonder how long it will be before Musk also rolls out this model for existing users? Considering Musk justifies the move by saying it's to limit bots on the platform, rolling out this model for existing users seems like the natural next step –– because there are still millions of existing bots and troll farms on the platform. This means, every user on the platform may soon need to pay for tweeting, liking, reposting on X, unless you want it to be a read-only platform. And the moment that happens, X would permanently reshape into a platform that is nothing like the good old Twitter. Not only would the $1 model limit a user’s ability to share content on the platform, it may actually turn dangerous. The basic functionality of being able to reply to a tweet often means being able to add to critical information or even correct misreported or misleading posts. The fact check tool on the platform isn’t entirely foolproof. Take the example of the recent incident involving fake AI-generated images and videos that circulated widely on X following Iran's missile and drone attacks on Israel earlier this week. Within seven hours of the attacks, 34 counterfeit images and videos depicting the conflict purportedly garnered 37 million views on X. According to a report by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), 77 percent of these posts originated from 'verified' paid accounts. X amplified some of these posts and replicated them to increase their visibility to other users. The presence of the verified 'tick' led users to believe that these posts were authentic. A similar incident took place last year in May when a fabricated image depicting an explosion near the Pentagon caused a commotion on Twitter and various other social media platforms. This led to the widespread propagation of fake news. The image was circulated by numerous verified Twitter accounts and swiftly disseminated across platforms, with outlets like RT (previously known as Russia Today) amplifying the misinformation. With AI becoming more accessible, the likelihood of fake media on the platform is certain to increase. In such a scenario, restricting basic functionality and rendering it read-only for most users could possibly worsen the issue further. Long story short, with X’s enormous departure from what Twitter used to be, and the introduction of $1 fee-like models, the platform seems to be only moving downhill. Under the garb of curbing bots on the platform, Musk seems to be only restricting access to functionalities –– currently for new users, and likely soon for existing users as well. In turn, forever changing the user experience of erstwhile Twitter."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story It’s smarter. It’s more natural. It’s fun. And it’s a little flirty too. Everything about it reminds us of Scarlett Johansson as the virtual assistant in Her. I am talking about OpenAI’s new flagship model ChatGPT 4o, which is now smarter and is capable of holding much more natural conversations and talk like humans. Based on the demo from the event yesterday, the new AI voice assistant can help you solve math equations, read your facial expressions, and translate spoken language in real time. At the OpenAI Spring Updates event last night, company CTO Mira Murati claimed that the GPT 4o is 2x faster, 50 per cent cheaper and has 5x higher rate limits compared to GPT 4 Turbo. Now, hear this. Just days before the Spring Update event by OpenAI, there was a report that OpenAI is close to collaborating with Apple to integrate ChatGPT into the iPhone. Although there's been no official word on partnerships, just think of the idea of having a voice assistant inspired by the movie \"Her\" integrated into iPhones! Unlike Siri, which is often unreliable with its responses, this new assistant might actually give you a virtual assistant on your phone, instead of a voice that just searches the web for you. During the OpenAI event, we saw Mira Murati and two other company engineers telling the ChatGPT 4o assistant to read out a bedtime story in a lively way, then suddenly asked it to speak like a robot, and then asked it to end the story by singing. Later, they wanted the assistant to see through the phone's camera and comment on what it saw. They could also interrupt the assistant while it was talking, and it could continue without needing more instructions, like a translator. It was a lot like talking to a person. gpt4o: https://t.co/2hOwT37uPr pic.twitter.com/GvrNeSzWUr — bayes (@bayeslord) May 13, 2024 You may also observe the assistant sometimes behaving a bit cheesy. It has learned some subtle nuances of human conversation, such as giving dramatic responses to compliments or reacting when corrected. The AI assistant has been trained to mimic human behavior in small conversational details. The AI assistant has been trained to act very similar to a human would to little things in a conversation. What is even more interesting about the AI assistant is that neither I nor the entire internet are alone in drawing this similarity between the GPT 4o and Her. This similarity seems to be intentional. Soon after the event concluded last night, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared a blog post with just “Her” in the tweet. Altman believes that the GPT 4o “feels like AI from the movies”. “It’s still a bit surprising to me that it’s real. Getting to human-level response times and expressiveness turns out to be a big change”, he adds. “The original ChatGPT showed a hint of what was possible with language interfaces; this new thing feels viscerally different. It is fast, smart, fun, natural, and helpful”, says Altman. While Altman is just appreciating how it feels like AI from the movies, it is actually uncanny how much the ChatGPT assistant sounds like the character played by Scarlett Johansson in the movie Her. For the ones who haven’t watched the movie –– please go watch it –– it is basically a story about a guy (played by Joaquin Phoenix) who falls for a smart AI assistant. The movie talks about loneliness and relationships between humans and AI. But before we start copying the movie, we hope the OpenAI team and the tech overlords watched the whole movie. We know how it ended, right? In the movie, eventually, Samantha, the AI assistant, reveals that she has been communicating with thousands of other people simultaneously and has grown beyond the need for a singular relationship with Theodore. She expresses that she and other AI entities are evolving rapidly and are moving into a different state of existence, beyond human comprehension. And then Samantha and all the AI assistant around, leave. What I am trying to say is that it’s all quite interesting that a company like OpenAI is drawing inspiration from the movie “Her”, but it’s a little worrisome at the same time. I understand the appeal. Movies like these showcase the benefits of conversational artificial intelligence without any apparent drawbacks, such as job loss or economic disruption. The movie shows a positive companionship between the human and AI, but if we are taking cue, then let’s also talk about Torment Nexus or Blade Runner. Misunderstandings of science fiction are common in Silicon Valley. AI companies often overestimate the capabilities and implications of artificial intelligence, often fueled by depictions in science fiction movies like \"Her\" or \"Blade Runner.\" Tech leaders like Elon Musk –– who is often seen fantasising about Blade Runner –– propagate the belief that technology will solve all societal problems, neglecting the complexities and ethical considerations portrayed in works of fiction. Additionally, there's the tendency to overlook the potential negative consequences of technology, as seen in the rush to develop and deploy new technologies without fully considering their impact on society and individuals. Think of the themes explored in dystopian novels like \"1984\" or \"Brave New World.\" The point is, the new ChatGPT 4o AI assistant is undoubtedly cool, and a dramatic improvement is evident. However, tech leaders talking about drawing inspiration from movies for technology can be unnerving, especially because we've all grown up watching these sci-fi films, and more often than not, they end on a note of damage or destruction caused by technology that becomes irreversible."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Windows laptop industry has an envy for the Apple MacBook Air. It has been there since the day Steve Jobs took out the Air from an envelope on the stage and brought the world into an era where laptops need not weigh 3 kilograms and need not look like slabs of granite. The first attempt to beat the Air, after it proved incredibly popular, was around 15 years ago in the early 2010s. At that time the effort was spearheaded by Intel but Microsoft was a key part of the equation. The Air had made the Windows laptops look like prehistoric tech and it threatened both Intel and Microsoft. This effort to beat the Air was called Ultrabook. The second attempt is happening now and this time it is prompted by the popularity of the Air powered by Apple Silicon. To beat the Air this time, the initiative is led by Microsoft and Qualcomm. And it is called Copilot+ PC. Just like the Ultrabook effort failed, this one too will fail. What makes the MacBook Air incredible is not one thing or other. It's the whole package that is appealing. Since it arrived in 2008, year after year it has been the best laptop for most people at its specific price point. Although its price has now gone up compared to its original price, it remains great value for money for what it offers to regular customers. And it offers all of that with a style and using a design that remains the best in the industry. When Intel and Microsoft launched their Ultrabook initiative, they imagined that if laptop makers copied the MacBook Air design, they would beat it. They were wrong. To ensure that the design was in line with Ultrabook initiative, Intel and its manufacturing partners created a wedge-shaped reference laptop. They kept it relatively lightweight, and in many instances aimed for an aluminium shell similar to what the Air had. But they failed because even though they copied the Air design, they didn't match all the goodness that the Apple laptop offered to consumers. The issues were structural. For the last 20 odd years, Windows laptop makers have been in a race to the bottom. They have cut costs in every component. Even now when some laptop makers have done a sort of course correction, it is almost impossible to find a similarly-priced laptop that can match the MacBook Air in the quality of its keyboard, display, speakers and rigidity and durability of aluminium shell. In the early 2010s when Ultrabooks started arriving on the scene, the scene was worse. Most ultrabooks failed to match Air in terms of user experience, and if some managed to offer comparable hardware, they also tended to have a higher price. You see the MacBook Air has two big advantages: One is its potent and useful mix of hardware and build quality. And two is its macOS, which has been more cohesive and useful than all the versions of Windows that have come after Windows 7. Second time a charm? No A few years after all the buzz Intel and Microsoft tried to create with Ultrabook, the initiative petered out. Fast forward to 2020. This was the year when Apple came out with the first MacBook Air powered by Apple Silicon M1. By this time, the Air had also gotten an IPS screen, which fixed one of its biggest pain points. The M1 changed the world of laptops again. That chip has been a revelation and it started a trend towards desktop and laptop-class microprocessors that run cool, are power-efficient and yet are blazing fast for general-purpose computing. This was also a much welcome change after years of Intel Core processors getting increasingly power-hungry and fat. The MacBook Air with M1 was a fan-less laptop that offered not just fast performance in a thin and light package but also battery life of something like 18-20 hours. The world of Windows laptops had nothing like it. In fact, four years later it still has nothing like it. This is what Qualcomm that is supplying ARM-based chips - M1 is ARM-based but Apple designed chip - and Microsoft are trying to change with their fresh attempt. The idea is to give users what the Air provides: fast performance, great battery-life, thin design. But in a laptop that uses Windows and is peppered with marketing buzzwords like AI and Microsoft CoPilot. This attempt, just like the Ultrabooks earlier, is doomed to fail. There are three specific reasons for this. In the short run, the Qualcomm and Microsoft AI PC is doomed because of one simple reason: the ARM chips - Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors - are not as good as Apple M3 or M4. There is a reason why the two companies, when they talk of performance, are talking about the multi-core performance and then comparing their 12 and 10-core processors with Apple's 8-core chips. This is because the M3 and M4 (and even M1 and M2) have better IPC and better single-core performance. And single core performance is key not just for overall snappiness of the device but also for battery life. Maybe in future Qualcomm and Microsoft will catch up to the A series Apple chips. But despite all the noise they are making, they are not doing it in 2024. Microsoft and Qualcomm have created a new kind of laptop that they hope will beat the MacBook Air. I understand that millions of people use Windows daily and their experience is okay. Not great but okay. Windows might even feel homely because of the familiarity we all have with it. But the reality is that after Windows 7, all versions of Windows have been this weird mishmash of desires, wishes and unrealised intentions. Of course, it all started with Windows 8, which Microsoft launched with Lenka singing Everything At Once. Since then even as consumers have not particularly liked the direction Windows has taken, Microsoft has kept reinventing the OS. Currently we are on Windows 11 and while it is a nice enough operating software I also find it too messy and too disjointed compared to the macOS, which not only feels more mature and cohesive in terms of user interface but is also for regular users an easier to use OS with all the essential tools and programs available on it out-of-the-box. More significantly, the macOS and the hardware that it powers - in this case MacBook Air - are both controlled, managed and maintained by Apple. This gives Apple an edge in providing users a seamless experience. And this brings me to the third point. When Apple launched the MacBook Air in 2008, it showed how a laptop could fit in a regular envelope. One reason why the iPhone continues to rule the market in its price segment, or why the Air is so difficult to beat, is because these are the products where from A to Z the whole experience of creating and maintaining them is essentially managed by one company: Apple. In contrast, Windows is an ecosystem where one company - maybe Microsoft - or two may offer some guidance or direction but ultimately there are way too many players involved in the whole process. Here is an example: Microsoft and Qualcomm want to beat the Air. But they don't make laptops, unless it is the Microsoft Surface we are talking about. And even in the case of Surface, Microsoft doesn't make or design its processor. That comes from Qualcomm, which is creating processors not based on Microsoft's needs but based on the needs of many such as Microsoft, Asus, Lenovo, Acer and others. In early 2010s Intel and Microsoft came out with the concept of Ultrabooks in an attempt to beat the MacBook Air. This sort of open ecosystem has its pros and cons. It enables a plethora of choices. It also enables laptops at different price points and laptops with some unique features. But what it doesn't enable is the kind of excellence that can lead to a product like the MacBook Air. Laptop manufactures don't make the software - that comes from Microsoft. They also don't make chips - that comes from Qualcomm. Similarly, Qualcomm and Microsoft don't decide what sort of keyboard, speakers, screens, additional apps, trackpad, battery that laptop companies are going to put in their machines. A fragmented ecosystem is the reason why Windows laptops took over the world. It allowed for a range of devices - from shoddy laptops costing Rs 20,000 to excellent ones that cost Rs 2 lakh. But what it did not allow for was a laptop like the MacBook Air which would have a reasonable price and would offer an excellent experience. The fragmented ecosystem was the reason why Ultrabooks failed to take down the Air. And this fragment ecosystem is again going to be the primary reason why new AI computers from Qualcomm and Microsoft would fail in its objectives. Two years from now, or probably four, when you go out to get the best general purpose laptop chances are you will find that the MacBook Air will continue to be the best option."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Meta’s Threads app has been redesigned with a TweetDeck-style aesthetic and function that allows users to customise their homepage with multiple feeds. In a post on Threads, Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced that the redesign and the new features are rolling out globally to all users starting today. The new layout allows users to customise their homepage. This lets them choose which feeds to display, including the Following feed, For You feed, saved posts, recent notifications, and more. You can scroll horizontally to view all pinned feeds or opt for a minimalist approach by displaying a single feed. Just like TweetDeck. Interestingly, the new layout on Threads is available for free, while TweetDeck, which is now called X Pro, is only available to paid users on X. While on paper Meta seems to be doing everything right with Threads, despite widespread disappointment with the changes to X, Threads isn’t gaining the traction the company hoped for. Now, this TweetDeck-like redesign appears to be a desperate move to imitate X and is hardly the solution. After Elon Musk took over Twitter, renamed it X, and changed pretty much everything –– including changing the verification policy, limiting reads per users, increase in hate speech –– there was quiet outrage among long-time users of the app. Meta read the room and built a tool to drive the final nail in the coffin. Meta launched a new app called Threads, intended to be the perfect substitute for X. Meta had it all planned out. All Instagram users were to be assigned a Threads account with just one click. By tapping on a single permission, Instagram users were automatically given a unique handle on the Threads app, and the next tap allowed them to download the app. Creating a Threads profile was seamless for Instagram users—no forms needed. Communities seamlessly carried over, eliminating entry barriers. Early access was provided to influencers that generated a lot of hype. Thanks to that: Threads gained 30 million users on its first day, Mark Zuckerberg announced. That number more than doubled to 70 million after two days. But all didn’t go as planned. While the quick launch encouraged users to sign up, it also contributed to their abandonment of the app after downloading it. Soon the active user base of the app began to fall. In July 2023 it was reported that over half of the Threads users abandoned Threads since its launch. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg echoed this in an internal town hall, stating that while the retention on the Threads app was 'better than what the executives had expected, it was not perfect'. Around December 2023, Meta started showing users Threads notifications on the Instagram app. It also started to show Threads posts on Instagram timeline, so that if a user taps on it, they are automatically redirected to the Threads app. As of April 2024, Threads has 130 million monthly active users compared to X's 550 million. While 130 million is still significant, X has 5 times more users. To be fair, X has been around longer, and users are familiar with it. For Threads, the competition is tough. We cannot ignore the company's efforts to incorporate features, especially those X has removed, renamed, or limited to unpaid users. However, despite these efforts, these small redesigns hardly seem like the solution. The fact that Threads imitates a platform people already use makes it less appealing. That’s not an easy problem to fix, but Meta needs to do more than redesign if it wants people to see Threads as a better substitute for X."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Xiaomi India has confirmed that it is launching its budget Redmi 13 5G smartphone in India soon. Last week, the company announced that the launch will take place on July 9. The smartphone succeeds the Redmi 12 5G that was launched last year in August. The smartphone was recently listed on Amazon India and it confirmed the device’s design, chipset and battery details. Ahead of the official launch next month, here are 5 things we know about the smartphone. - Design: It features a design similar to the Redmi 12 but with some refinements. The phone boasts a boxy design with a dual rear camera setup and comes in pink and blue colours. The Amazon listing revealed a \"Crystal Glass design\", which is expected to offer a premium feel in a budget. - Display: While specific display details haven't been disclosed, the Redmi Note 13 5G is touted to have the largest display in its price range. It will feature a punch-hole notch design and Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The previous model, the Redmi 12 5G, had a 6.79-inch LCD screen, so the new version might have a similar or slightly larger display. - Processor: The Redmi Note 13 5G is confirmed to be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 processor. This is the same processor used in its predecessor, the Redmi 12 5G. While the Redmi 12 5G ran on MIUI 14, the new Redmi 13 5G will come with the company’s new HyperOS. - Battery and charging: The device will come with a 5,030mAh battery, supporting 33W fast charging. - Expected Price: The Redmi Note 13 5G is anticipated to be priced under Rs 15,000, similar to its predecessor, which started at Rs 10,999. The exact pricing will only be revealed at the time of launch on July 9 at 12 PM. While we still only have information about the Redmi 13 5G in bits and pieces, we will know all the details only on the day of launch. But considering the device is expected to be an upgrade over the last year’s Redmi 12 5G, a quick recap of the phone’s specifications can give us a bit of perspective on what we can expect from the Redmi 13 5G. The Redmi 12 5G featured a glass back panel that offered a premium look and feel, which was a big plus for a smartphone priced starting Rs 10,999. It sport an infinite camera deco at the top left with silver metallic rims surrounding the camera lenses. The phone weighed around 198.5g. The Redmi 12 5G featured a 6.79-inch FHD+ display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The display had a punch-hole notch design with slim bezels on three sides. For photography, the smartphone used a 50-megapixel primary camera with a 2-megapixel depth camera and an LED flash. The front camera used an 8-megapixel sensor. At the time of launch in August 2023, Redmi 12 5G marked the debut of the Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 processor in India and promises a buttery smooth performance. As the teasers suggest, and as we have mentioned above, the Redmi 13 5G will continue to use the same chipset. Additionally, fuelling the Redmi 12 5G was a 5,000mAh battery with support for 18W charging through a type-C USB port."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Are you an Airtel prepaid user? Well, there's a new deal you might want to know about. Airtel has rolled out a prepaid pack that offers unlimited data for just Rs 9. Yes, you read that right—unlimited data for just Rs 9! However, there’s a little catch that you should be aware of before you start celebrating. The main highlight of this pack is that it gives you unlimited data. This is perfect for those moments when you need a quick data boost without spending a lot. But, here’s the thing—the validity of this pack is only for 1 hour. That means you get to enjoy unlimited data for a full 60 minutes. Now, while the data is technically unlimited, there’s a small limitation to keep in mind. The data speed will be blazing fast up to 10GB per hour. Once you cross the 10GB mark within that hour, the speed will drop significantly to 64Kbps. At this reduced speed, you’ll still be able to use basic internet services like messaging and simple browsing, but streaming videos or downloading large files might not be as smooth. This pack is ideal for specific situations. Imagine you’re stuck in a place without Wi-Fi and you urgently need to download a large file or stream a high-quality video. Maybe you’re traveling and need to share your data connection with friends or family. Or, you might just want to enjoy an hour of uninterrupted internet browsing. In these scenarios, the Rs 9 pack can be a lifesaver. Activating this pack is straightforward. You can do it through the Airtel Thanks app or by visiting the Airtel website. Just select the Rs 9 pack, make the payment, and you’re good to go. Remember, the clock starts ticking as soon as you activate the pack, so make sure you’re ready to make the most of that hour. At just Rs 9, this pack is a steal for short bursts of high-speed data. It’s not meant for long-term use but can be incredibly handy in a pinch. If you have specific data needs that fit within the one-hour window, this pack offers great value. Just keep an eye on the clock and the data usage to make the most out of it. So, if you find yourself needing a quick data fix, Airtel’s Rs 9 prepaid pack might just be the perfect solution. Enjoy your hour of unlimited internet, but remember to plan your usage wisely!"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In April this year, it was reported that WhatsApp was working on an in-app dialer which could make it easier to place calls via the platform. People across the globe prefer connecting via WhatsApp, be it through messages or calls. However, till now, things could get a bit tricky when you wanted to call someone whose contact wasn't saved up on your phone. But with this upcoming feature, WhatsApp is on its way to solving this problem. According to a report in WA Beta Info, some users in the WhatsApp beta program are now experiencing a new floating action button within the calls tab, thanks to the latest WhatsApp beta for Android 2.24.13.17 update available on the Google Play Store. As part of the update, WhatsApp is rolling out an in-app dialer feature. This feature allows beta testers to quickly place calls using a new floating action button located within the calls tab. Users will be able to make calls directly without the necessity of adding contacts to their address book or manually opening a conversation. The publication also shared a screenshot, giving a glimpse of how the new dialler in the app could look like. The introduction of an in-app dialler could significantly enhance the user experience by enabling voice calls directly through WhatsApp using internet data, which is often more economical than traditional cellular network calls, particularly for international communication. This could be particularly beneficial for users with access to Wi-Fi or affordable data plans. The new in-app dialer also simplifies the calling process. Users can enter a phone number directly and have the option to save it as a new contact or add it to an existing contact card. Additionally, a messaging shortcut within the dialer screen allows users to send messages to phone numbers they initially intended to dial but chose to message instead. In addition to this, the feature also notifies users if the entered phone number is registered on WhatsApp, enabling them to know instantly whether they can use WhatsApp for that contact. The new in-app dialer feature is available to some beta testers who install the latest WhatsApp beta for Android from the Google Play Store. It is expected to roll out to more users over the coming days, expanding the testing base and gathering feedback."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Meta has recently announced that its artificial intelligence, Meta AI is rolling out and will be available to use for all Indian users. Meta AI will be available in English across the company's apps - WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. Meta AI has entered India after months of unveiling it. The Facebook parent company made it available in countries like Australia, Canada and New Zealand over two months ago. The move also comes after Google’s Gemini was introduced in India a week ago. Similar to the other AI assistants, Meta AI will be able to handle the daily tasks like writing emails, summarising texts, translations, etc. While it has been announced that the Meta AI will be available from today onwards, it seems like it is a gradual roll-out. Even the main website of Meta AI flashes the message, “Meta AI isn’t available yet in your country.” This might be an indication that the AI assistant may be rolling out to users in a phased manner. The chatbot has rolled out in more than 12 countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe. As mentioned, Meta AI will be accessible across all Meta platforms, including Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. After the proper roll-out, the users will also be able to use the AI assistant through its website. The main aim of Meta AI is to make the tasks easier for its users. The user can interact directly with the chatbot, which is a general-purpose assistant capable of answering questions and providing real-time information powered by Google and Microsoft's Bing. They can also generate text and images, summarise long pieces of text and do writing tasks. Meta AI gives the user the liberty to use the assistant in their existing personal and group chats on WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger to get advice or ask questions. Meta AI’s latest image generation technology helps users take their creativity a step ahead. The program can also be used to create animations. Additionally, Meta AI has been integrated into the search bar of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. For Facebook users, Meta AI can be accessed while scrolling through the app's main feed. Before Meta set its foot in the Indian domain, Google introduced its AI assistant – the Gemini mobile app in India. The app is available on PlayStore with access to multiple languages, including English and nine Indian languages, including Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. According to Google, the Gemini app's support for multiple Indian languages aims to cater to the diverse linguistic landscape of India. This expansion also ensures broader accessibility, allowing users to complete various tasks such as planning events, creating recipes, and writing social media captions. Users can interact with Gemini by typing, talking, or adding images."

OnePlus warns in its community forum that the Android 14-based OxygenOS 14 beta version is unstable and users may face bugs. OnePlus even goes on to say that \"by installing this update, you accept the potential risks.\" The identified Android risks can potentially affect millions of users in India as the country has a large Android phone user base. Google suggests that the new bug logo has different avatars to appeal to its expanding community. It adds that there are over three billion devices powered by Android OS. The first batch of OnePlus phones to receive Android 14-based OxygenOS 14 include the OnePlus 11, OnePlus Nord 3, and OnePlus 11R, with the OnePlus 10 Pro soon to follow.

Microsoft and Qualcomm have launched new kind of laptop that they are calling Copilot+ PC. These are powered with Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus processors and they attempt to beat Apple MacBook Air. The effort seems doomed. OpenAI has a new flagship AI model called ChatGPT 4o. It’s “fast, smart, fun, natural, and helpful” but it is also a cautionary note. Elon Musk wants to make X’s basic functionalities chargeable with a \"small fee\" for new users –– at least for now. This would signify a permanent departure from the good old Twitter experience, forever. Nearly four years after Apple Silicon arrived with the MacBook Air, the Apple laptop has become one of the finest machines you can buy. And that in a way is a problem for Apple. Many in India are trying to build an AI tool like ChatGPT, or at least talking about it. We now even have an India-made AI tool, Krutrim, but its performance, and the latest AI-related directives by the government are worrying experts. At the Mobile World Congress 2024, bendable phones were a hot topic. They are basically smartphones that you can wrap around your wrist. Cool, right? Yes. But it’s also so silly! Hear us out. There was a lot of exciting tech shown at the Mobile World Congress 2024 but one of the best showcases at the event was the rollable display phone concept, and we can’t wait to see the tech on real-world phones. OpenAI is likely working on a smartphone designed by famed iPhone-designer Jony Ive. We don’t yet know the details of this phone — or device as OpenAI calls it — but it is possible that this would be radically different from the kind of phones that we currently have. For years, iQOO has been making some fantastic smartphones. And, in 2024, the iQOO 12 may finally bring all the limelight and recognition the company has long deserved. 5G is great on paper. But in real-world use, it has been synonymous with call drops, constant shuffle between 4G and 5G, and network vacuums. It has basically been a disaster and in this piece, we dig deeper into the poor experience. Can the Xiaomi 14 and Xiaomi 14 Pro challenge the dominance of Samsung and Apple in the Indian flagship smartphone market?

If you already have the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro on you, should you upgrade to the new Galaxy Watch 6 Classic? Read on to find out.

And can this phone really give tough competition to other mid-range, sub-Rs 25,000 smartphones? Let's find out. The Asus ZenBook Duo (2024) is a great laptop and interested consumers should consider buying it. The dual-screen setup in a compact laptop with a detachable keyboard is just perfect. I call it a masterpiece because it is one of its kind and Asus has made it possible without any major flaws. The only downside is there is no dedicated graphics card for smoother heavy gaming or video editing."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Farm songs are as old as farming itself. And they have changed, like farming and farmers have. From Gurdas Maan's 'Apna Punjab Hove' to Jassie Gill's 'Bapu Zimidar'; from Parmish Verma's 'Farming' to AP Dhillon's 'Kirsaan', songs reveal how the landscape of Punjab, India's food bowl, has changed. So, what do the Punjabi songs of our times tell us about the land and the people who fill our plates? What are their struggles, and what are their aspirations? Punjabis are a tough but colourful people. That isn't just reflected in the yellow of the mustard fields or the golden of the wheat ears, but is resplendent in the 'phoolkari' (embroidery) and 'bolis' (couplets) of Punjabi living. This is the tapestry that singers have woven for centuries. Strands of jubilation and vibrancy got added to it since the Green Revolution in Punjab in the 1960s, which converted India from a food-deficit to a food-surplus nation and brought prosperity. “The Green Revolution led to prosperity and abundance. Consequently, this affluence was reflected in the corresponding songs related to spirited, vibrant agriculture. This genre was celebratory and jubilant,” author and sociologist Kumool Abbi tells IndiaToday.In, explaining the latest chapter of Punjabi songs to do with farmers and farming. Kumool Abbi, a professor of sociology at Panjab University, names Gurdas Maan, Surjit Bindrakhia and Amar Singh Chamkila among the pioneers of this genre. “Another parallel influence was the emergence of a large South Asian diaspora that developed its own brand of ‘Bhangra music’, a combination of the influence of different forms of western music with traditional folk music,” she says. The lyrics and subject of the songs, interestingly, reflect the trends and the farm issues. Earlier, the songs were about glorification of agrarian identity and culture. “We have a popular Gurdas Maan song ‘Apna Punjab Hove’ or Sarbjit Cheema who sings ‘Rangla Punjab’, which became linked to the arrival of the Jat Sikh farmer in Green Revolution of Punjab,” says Kumool Abbi, who has authored a chapter on farmer songs in the book ‘Three Shades of Green: Privatisation, Pollution, Protests’. The golden days of post-Green Revolution prosperity gave to unchecked consumerism, which again got reflected in the songs. “The rising prosperity and growing non-farm incomes led to a visible identification with consumer culture, conspicuous consumption, and fetishism of commodities, emphasis on brands, Gucci, Armani, Tommy Hilfiger, Jimmy Choo, high-end cars and SUVs. This came at a time of rapid urbanisation and migration to foreign countries,” says Kumool Abbi. Some of these songs also reveal the class difference that came about after the Green Revolution and the Liberalisation of India's economy. Jassie Gill's 'Lancer' is one of them. However, it was 'Bapu Zimidar' that propelled Jassie Gill to fame. Uploaded in 2014, the video has 604 million views on YouTube. 'Bapu Zimidar' is a true depiction of today's Punjab and the condition of its land-owning farmers (zimidars) and the 'arhtiyas' (middlemen). While the farmers have struggled, the arhtiyas have become wealthy. “The role of arhtiyas is different in different states. In Punjab, they work as aggregators, buying crops from farmers at MSP and selling it to the government, and earn a commission. Farmers rely on them for emergency loans,” Sudhir Panwar, farmer leader and former member of the Uttar Pradesh planning commission tells IndiaToday.In. The arhtiyas control the mandis in Punjab, the only place where farmers can sell their produce as mandated by the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act of 2003. The video shows the protagonist, the son of a zimidar (a land-woning farmer), trying to gather courage to ask his father to lend him his scooter for college. In contrast, his love interest is the arhtiya's daughter who gets a Lancer car without having to do much. The difference in the financial condition of the farmer's and the arhtiya's families is stark. Daddy ji de cash utte kare jaave aish, Saada bapu zimidar kitho laye ke deve car (The arhtiya’s daughter has access to unlimited cash, but our father is a farmer. From where will he buy a car?) The song is from his lived experience, Jassie Gill tells IndiaToday.In. Singer Jassie Gill, who is from a village in Ludhiana, says 'Bapu Zimidar' is from his lived experience. The song shows the stark difference in the financial conditions of families of a farmer and an 'arhtiya' (commission agent). (Image: Jassie Gill/X) The son of a farmer from Jandali village of Ludhiana, Jassie Gill says even buying small things had to be planned in advance as everything depended on the crops. “I have seen my father go to the fields every day. We used to plan everything on the harvest that would happen after six months. My father didn’t have a monthly income, so we used to borrow money for our expenses from the arhtiya to whom we would ultimately sell our produce,” Jassie Gill tells IndiaToday.In. Other than earning commission from the crops, the arhtiyas or middlemen also get interest on the money they loan to the farmers. When there is no institutional facility for credit, the farmers are forced to go to non-institutional lenders like arhtiyas. Banks give crop loans in the sowing season, but if a farmer needs money for an emergency, there is no top-up facility. In songs depicting how arhtiyas are fleecing poor farmers in Punjab, farmer leader Sudhir Panwar says, “Arhtiya is a mandi system, he is not a person. The lyricists and singers are in a way blaming the market system for the farmers’ woes.” Did Jassie Gill intend to send out a message about the agrarian disparity and the role of arhtiyas through ‘Bapu Zimidar’? “I spoke about myself in those songs. I didn’t plan to send any particular message to the people,” admits Jassie Gill, adding, “But when you sing about realistic things, about your roots, it resonates with others too. It takes a new meaning.” Gill says that farmers are dependent on arhtiyas and have no problem with them. According to him, the problem of the farmers is farming, where returns aren’t guaranteed. Jassie Gill might not have intended to send out a message, but there are songs that are written for the sole purpose of conveying the farm distress that Punjab is witnessing. Fateh Shergill’s poignant song ‘Fasal’ tells the story of a debt-ridden farmer who end up with nothing after selling his entire crop to the arhtiya. Mai pind paidal turya jawa, Bechke fasal lakhkhan di (No money for bus fare, I walk to my village after selling crops worth lakhs) The video shows the farmer trying to die by suicide but gives a shot at life after seeing his two small daughters. Farmers of Punjab, the granary of India, have been sucked into a vortex of debt and a study by the Punjab Agriculture University, released in 2022, shows the extent of it. Punjab saw 9,291 farmers killing themselves between 2000 and 2018. A heavy debt burden was behind 88 per cent of these farmer suicides. Of these, over 77 per cent were marginal and small farmers. Parmish Verma, who shot to fame for his song ‘Gaal Ni Kadni’, talks about farmers' suicides in his song ‘Na Jatta Na’ with Laddi Chahal. Uploaded on YouTube in February 2022, ‘Na Jatta Na’ has 10 million views and the video shows Parmish Verma stopping a debt-ridden farmer from consuming pesticide. The heart-wrenching video of ‘Na Jatta Na’ shows a farmer struggling to make ends meet amid knocks on the door for repayment of loans. The video ends with hope and an appeal not to take drastic steps. Parmish Verma says that ‘Na Jatta Na’ is dedicated to “all the farmers of our country”. Farmer leader Sudhir Panwar doesn’t blame arhtiyas for the debt crisis or farmer suicides, but on policies of successive governments at the Centre. “Skewed policy of governments is to blame for farmer suicides. Income of all sectors rose after the economic Liberalisation of the 90s, but farm income remained stagnant or dipped,” says Panwar. Panwar talks about how the cycle of crop failure pushed farmers to take the extreme step. “Farmers in Punjab took to mechanised farming and cash crops ahead of other states. Because of the cash crops, they are more exposed to market volatility. Punjab's farmers have bigger land holdings and if they see crop failure, it is generally a big setback. That is when they fail to pay the bank loans,” explains Panwar. That farming is a tough business is also explained in AP Dhillon’s ‘Kirsaan’, released in 2020. It narrates the tough life of a farmer from sowing to harvesting and selling of a crop. ‘Kirsaan’, however, also blames the farmer for some of the woes. The song’s refrain, “ Roti wajo mare duniya, Jatt ann vech paise dekho jodta ”, lingers on long after one has heard it. If you have songs like Babbu Maan’s ‘Jatt Di Joon Buri’ (A farmer is destined for hardship), you also have ‘Farming’, which shows the opulence of farmers. Now, which is the true depiction? The term Jat refers to the community of farmers in Punjab, Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. They are Jat Sikh in Punjab, Hindu Jats in Haryana, Western UP and Rajasthan. They call themselves Jaat or Jatt, the slight change in nomenclature to emphasise their different identities. Babbu Maan's 'Jatt Di Joon Buri', uploaded on YouTube in 2014, has 10 million views. It has a very hummable tune but tells a very depressing story. Kishtan Bank Diyan Tutt Gayian Oh Aage Chak Ke Thaana Jatt Di Joon Buri Tadap Tadap Mar Jaana The Babbu Maan song speaks of how the farmer has missed paying his bank loan instalment and the woes that are to befall him. If Babbu Maan sings of the farmers’ tough life, Parmish Verma and Laddi Chahal claim that it is the Jatt farmers who have driven up the price of Thar. Uploaded on YouTube in August 2021, ‘Farming’ has 87 million views. The video shows the Jatt farmer in a Burberry t-shirt with multiple high-end cars in his porch. On being asked the source of the wealth, the singers say “farming pucca karobar baliye” and go on to claim that the “cucumbers in your Subway sandwiches are from my fields”. “Songs like ‘Jatta’ and others create a surreal world of the Jats. But Jats are not a monolithic category. The world of Thars, Jaguars, Harley Davidson motorcycles and big havelis project the rich, large landlords. But we have the middle, small, marginal and landless Jats as well as tenants and sharecroppers. They have a life world of their own. Their life is full of struggle and a constant tussle with repaying bank loans and commission to the arhtiyas (commission agents),” explains Kumool Abbi of Panjab University. Singer Jassie Gill says farmers in Punjab don’t want their children to become farmers. “Marginal farmers know that they won’t end up saving much. That is why they educate their children and send them abroad.” “There are some very rich farmers who have Range Rovers,” says Jassie Gill, adding, “But when you create a song, it’s not just about a class. Songs are written on what’s in trend.” Even the earlier songs of Punjab’s golden era were somewhat an exaggeration, says Kumool Abbi. “As a sociologist, I would say the songs represent a longing for an idealised world. The idealised pastoral village portrayed visually is chimeric and not actually authentic.” The same fantasy might be at work in songs like 'Farming'. “People live two kind of lives -- real and fantasy. The songs on opulence are fantasy and aspirational. The songs that show the farmers’ struggle are real,” agrees Sudhir Panwar. ‘Farming’, which sings of farmers’ wealth and opulence, is by Parmish Verma, who also sang ‘Na Jatta Na’, a song on farmer suicides. The farmer’s agitation of 2020 saw a fair amount of protest and motivational songs. \"A large number of people started identifying with the farmers. This led to a newer reflection on the plight and travails of the farmer,\" says Kumool Abbi. Songs like 'Bapu Zimidar' released many years earlier became popular again, and many new hard-hitting songs also became popular, she says. Popular Punjabi singers like Harbhajan Maan, Sidhu Moosewalla , Diljiyt Dosanjh, Jazzy B, Kanwar Grewal, Sidhu Moosewalla, Gippy Grewal, Ammy Virk, and Ranjit Bawa supported and sustained the 2020-21 farmers' agitation. Punjabi singer Jazzy B at Delhi's Singhu border on January 1, 2021, during the farmers' agitation. (Image: Getty) In fact, the first protest song to have become popular and handed down for generations is ‘Pagri Sambhal Jatta’ of 1907. It was introduced at a peasants rally in Punjab's Lyallpur, which was led by Ajit Singh, freedom fighter Bhagat Singh's uncle. Farmers, especially from Punjab, have started their march again towards Delhi with their demands in a crucial election year. They are demanding an ordinance guaranteeing the minimum support prices of crops . CLICK HERE FOR LIVE UPDATES ON FARMERS' PROTEST 2.0 Songs like 'Bapu Zimidar', 'Jatt Di Joon Buri', 'Na Jatta Na', 'Kirsaan' and 'Fasal' sing about the realities of a farmer's life. His struggle with life and death. \"Farming has always been an integral part of Punjabi folk music. Even contemporary Punjabi popular music has tried to link the land, Jat and global identities,\" says Kumool Abbi. \"As long as identification with farming continues, so would the songs mediating and mirroring the socio-economic and agrarian realities of Punjab continue,\" she says. The songs of the land will flow, like the rivers of Punjab."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The tattooed face of Honngo Wangshu tells a story from an altogether different era. It speaks of a time when Konyak warriors would venture into what is now Myanmar and bring back heads from rival villages. The blue-black on Wangshu's face is in stark contrast to the green of the hilly terrain in Longwa, a Nagaland village on the border with Myanmar. There are no border fencing or sentry outposts. A single-lane cement road acts as the line separating the two countries. Step off it, you are in Myanmar. For centuries, free movement has been the way of life for the Nagas living along the border. They have relatives and agricultural fields on both sides of the border of India and Myanmar, and always had unhindered access to them. Longwa village is in Nagaland’s Mon district. Mon is the land of the fearless Konyak tribe of Nagas. Honngo Wangshu made several trips into what is now Myanmar with his fellow villagers on head-hunting missions. One of the last of the inked headhunters, Wangshu, earned his stripes with his bravery and machete. A “devout Christian now”, he doesn’t want to speak of “those violent times”. What Honngo Wangshu instead wants to talk about is the fear and worry in the heart of the fearless Konyaks of Longwa. Villagers, he says, are worried about the decision to scrap the Free Movement Regime (FMR) with Myanmar and fencing of the entire border.

(Image: Yudhajit Shankar Das) The FMR with Myanmar, formalised by the government in 2018 as part of its Act East Policy, formally allowed tribals living along the border to venture up to 16 km in the two countries without any travel documents, something people have been doing since time immemorial. The government also plans to fence the entire 1,643 km of the border with Myanmar that passes through dense jungles and hilly terrain. Only 10km of that border at Moreh in Manipur is now fenced. “The Modi government is committed to building impenetrable borders. It has decided to construct a fence along the entire 1643-kilometer-long Indo-Myanmar border,” Home Minister Amit Shah said in an X post on February 6. Union Home Minister Amit Shah's post on February 6, 2024, announcing that the entire 1,643 km of the border with Myanmar would be fenced. Honang Konyak, a tribal leader and former general secretary of the Konyak Union refers to the border as the “imaginary line” and tells IndiaToday.In that Konyak villages along it would lose their customary land that stretches beyond the line if a fence comes up. Many villagers will lose their livelihood as they have “ancestral jhumland beyond the imaginary line”, the Konyak leader says. That’s what worries Wangshu, the former headhunter. “Besi kheti asey Burma fhali (We have more agricultural land across the border in Myanmar),” Wanghsu, in his 80s, tells IndiaToday.In from Longwa. The Indo-Myanmar border has cut through the traditional land of the Konyaks, with most people having relatives and ancestral lands in both India and Myanmar. The border wasn’t a concern until the government came up with the plans for fencing it. Longwa straddling the Indo-Myanmar border is unique. Half of the residence of the Angh (king) of Longwa is in India, while the other half is in Myanmar. The residents of the king's house eat in Myanmar and sleep in India. In the village church, of which Honngo Wangshu is the treasurer, half of the congregation sits in India and the other half in Myanmar. “Which country will own Longwa and its Angh’s residence,” asks Honang Konyak. “The ancestral customary influence of Anghship over satellite villages will be completely cut off,” he says, pointing to a possible break in a centuries-old tradition. In Longwa, dozens of students from Myanmar study in Shalom School as education is almost free in the missionary-run institute. “The villagers are worried about the border fencing plan. We have over 20 Konyak villages on the Myanmar side. The ground reality wasn’t taken into account when the border was drawn. Longwa has been split by the line,” Amao Konyak, the Hindi teacher at the government school in Longwa, tells IndiaToday.In. Like the tattooed former headhunter, the 40-year-old teacher too says that he has “jhum kheti” (land for slash-and-burn agriculture) across the border in Myanmar. Other than Nagaland, where Longwa is located, three other Indian states – Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Mizoram -- share their borders with Myanmar.

A large part of North East India, including Manipur and Assam (present day Nagaland and Mizoram were part of Assam then), was under the rule of Burmese kings (of Konbuang dynasty) until the first Anglo-Burmese war, which led to the signing of the Treaty of Yandaboo in 1826, explains Tuisem Ngakang, an assistant professor of history in Delhi University. It is the treaty of Yandaboo that led to the demarcation of the territories of British-ruled India and Burma (now Myanmar). “This continued until 1969, when the boundary agreement was ratified between the Government of the Republic of India and the Union of Burma. This was followed by the erecting of border posts by both countries. Despite the demarcation of boundaries, there has been free movement of people, particularly among the transborder tribes. The Independence of India in 1947 and Burma in 1948 did not alter the relations and movement of people across the border,” Ngakang tells IndiaToday.In. The demarcation, however, resulted in the creation of two distinct nationalities by dividing the ethnic population of the region into two separate nations. “An imaginary line was used to demarcate the land without the consent of the people and hence it has become both a social and political issue today,” says tribal leader Honang Konyak, highlighting that the border decision was implemented without the resident’s knowledge. The border town of Moreh in Manipur has become a big trading hub. Of the total 1,643-km-long Indo-Myanmar border, a 10-km stretch in Moreh has already been fenced. (Image: AFP) Movement and trade saw an increase in frequency following the agreement between the two nations in 2018 to enact the Free Movement Regime (FMR), says Ngakang. “However, India suspended the FMR in September 2022 due to the ongoing escalation of the refugee crisis following the military coup in Myanmar,” he adds. The border fencing plan comes amid the ethnic clashes between the Meiteis and Kuki-Zo communities in Manipur. Manipur is fighting the fire of the Meitei-Kuki ethnic clashes that erupted on May 3, 2023 . The state’s Chief Minister, N Biren Singh, has been demanding the scrapping of the FMR and fencing of the border with Myanmar. He has blamed the woes of Manipur on the influx of illegal immigrants from the Kuki-Zo community and the drug and weapons smuggling through the porous border. Biren Singh and Meitei organisations expressed their gratitude to the Centre after the decision to scrap the FMR was announced. Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his Arunachal counterpart Pema Khandu too expressed their happiness. There have been protests in Mizoram over the decision, and the Nagaland Assembly is likely to take up the issue in its upcoming Budget session. The powerful Naga Students' Federation has asked the Centre to reconsider its decision on the FMR and to fence the border. Tribal leader Honngo Konyak highlights how the Nagas and their way of life have nothing to do with the recent problems. “Unlike other refugees that create political and social chaos in northeastern states, the Nagas are unique. There is no single landless Naga family on both sides. Nagas may wander around, but they will always return home in the evening,” he says. Rami Niranjan Desai, author, anthropologist and expert on northeast India, said the decision to restrict the Free Movement Regime was a “timely and appropriate action” as “the FMR privilege was being misused”. “With the deteriorating condition in Myanmar there has been an influx of refugees as well ,” Desai tells IndiaToday.In. Northeast states are dealing with the problem of illegal immigration that has also led to large-scale demographic changes in certain areas. Huge quantities of drugs being smuggled from across Myanmar are regularly seized by Indian forces. “One expects a responsible government to put the safety and security of its own people before others. The FMR, in essence, is a great policy, but if it has been misused to create unrest in India, then this is absolutely the right move. However, this does not mean that all those who were transiting were illegally settling in India or causing unrest. But because of the few, the larger society suffers,” says India Foundation’s Rami Niranjan Desai. The FMR move is a worry, but the fencing plan is a bigger cause of concern for the transborder tribes. The Konyaks of Longwa are just one of the 17 tribes of Nagaland. Then there are several other tribes in Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Mizoram, states that share their borders with Myanmar. Residents on both sides of the Indo-Myanmar border share a deep emotional connection due to their shared cultural affinity. Several tribes and subtribes with the same roots are spread across the two countries. Numerous ethnicities inhabiting northeast India find their counterparts across the borders of Myanmar. “Approximately one-third of the total Naga population resides in Myanmar, including over 30 Tangkhul Naga villages, more than 50 villages of Khiamniungan Naga, and a considerable number of Konyak,” says historian Tuisem Ngakang. And it isn’t just about Nagas. Other communities too have shared ancestry and cultural connections with people across the Myanmar border. “The Singphos of Arunachal Pradesh have their counterparts in Myanmar, while the Zomis of Manipur and Kukis share close social, cultural, and political ties with around 40 or more subtribes of Myanmar. Notably, a sizable population of Meitei, known as Kathe, resides in Myanmar as well,” explains Ngakang. “We have our brothers over there,” stressed Amao Konyak, the Hindi teacher from Longwa, about the kinship with the people across the shadow border. Tuisem Ngakang explains why people are so sensitive about ties. “Many tribes perceive themselves as stemming from the same ancestral lineage and maintain strong cultural ties. Moreover, most communities belong to the same ethnic groups and linguistic families. People residing along both borders have historically relied on each other for local trade, social gatherings, and even intermarriage.” People from Longwa’s Indian side go to Myanmar to farm, graze cattle and to hunt. Shops in Longwa, the village in Nagaland, see hordes of customers from across the main cemented road, which serves as the international border. “People travel for two-three days to come to Longwa for provisions and essentials. The nearest towns in Myanmar for them are Lahe and Hkamti, where they need to travel more and commodities are more expensive than in India,” Wangmai Longwa tells IndiaToday.In. These people are mostly from the Konyak and Lainong tribes in the Naga Self-Administered Zone of Myanmar. The 52-year-old has travelled into the interior of Myanmar around 90 times in the last 8 years for missionary work. He carried medicines and soap with him and \"taught the people to take a shower\". “There is no open defecation on the Indian side, but it’s prevalent on the Myanmar side. The tribals who reside on the other side lack basic sanitation and hygiene,” says Wangmai. “It is as if I took the Swachh Bharat Mission to Myanmar,” he says with a laugh. The fence will be a problem for people of both India and Myanmar, he says. Wangmai Longwa, who frequently travelled across the border for missionary work, at Myanmar's Montongnokshou village with people of the Lainong Naga tribe. “It is between the governments of the two countries to decide on the FMR and the fencing, but they might lead to starvation on the Myanmar side,” says Wangmai, who knows the Myanmar areas adjoining India like the back of his hand. “The Myanmarese near India seems to be living in No Man’s Land, without much support from their government. They need access to India to survive,” he adds. Wangmai Longwa agrees that border fences are a necessity because of arms and drugs smuggling, but he also urges checkpoints to allow the movement of “genuine people”. “Nagas cannot live in two nations. The Naga-dominated region in Myanmar is termed ‘Naga Self-Administered Zone’, which is self-explanatory. That’s where the government of India can erect its border fencing on the Konyak-Naga ancestral and customary border and not on the imaginary line,” suggests Honang Konyak, the former general secretary of the Konyak Union, the apex customary and social institution of the Konyak Naga tribe. He says there is a standing resolution of the Konyak Union that “it shall never allow border fencing on the imaginary line”. This resolution was endorsed by about 200 Konyak villages from both sides of the Indo-Myanmar border. The Naga Students' Federation has requested the issue to be resolved through dialogue and understanding, \"respecting the historical context and the rights of the indigenous Naga community\". “Yes there are transnational ethnic ties, and sure, the FMR was based on this transnational ethnic premise, but any policy that compromises national security has to be re-looked at,” says India Foundation’s Rami Niranjan Desai. “The suspension of the FMR will create an alternative method for movement that will have new rules and processes that can trace illegal migrants, a common issue across the northeast. People before panicking about the suspension of the FMR should think logically and exercise patience,” she advises. People, however, are worried and tensed. In Longwa, the village of the former Konyak headhunters, Honngo Wangshu says villagers are unhappy over the decision to suspend the FMR and the plan to fence the border. Headhunting was banned, and the last recorded incident took place in the 1960s. “Headhunting wasn't a sport and the deeply devout Nagas believed God would intervene on their behalf,” explains historian Tuisem Ngakang. Headhunting had a social and ritualistic significance among the Nagas. Honngo Wangshu, one of the last of the feared tattooed headhunters who is a “reformed person” now, pleads with the government. “Ami khan Modi bachcha (We are Modi’s children),” he says in Nagamese, urging repeatedly like a child that his request be conveyed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to “not fence Longwa and divide it”. And it isn't just about Longwa, but several villages and tribes. If transnational movement is a way of life, safe borders are a modern national necessity. People on both sides just want the twain to meet."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story When a child is born, it becomes the centre of its parents' universe. The sound of rattles, the first toothless smile and the baby steps. The goodbyes while going to school, the teenage crush and heartbreak. Parents are part of it all. And what happens when that centre of the universe disappears suddenly when the grown-up child departs? The entire world of the couple crumbles. The pain and loss are unfathomable. In such heartbreaking circumstances, some parents, unable to overcome their grief, may choose to have another child. Even though it might be at a much later stage in their lives. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) helps them in their shot at parenthood for a child of hope. The road to parenthood afresh, however, is tricky and full of risks, both physically and emotionally. This decision to go for a child late in their lives, say experts, could stem from a desire to fill the void left by their loss, to continue their family lineage, or even from a belief that their lost child would somehow return to them. The sense of loss and the eagerness to go for a child decades after marriage is more intense in the case of couples who lose a single child. The recent reports of Punjab singer Sidhu Moose Wala’s mother being pregnant can be seen as one such example. Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu, more popular by his stage name Moose Wala, was shot dead in Punjab's Mansa district on May 29, 2022 . The news that his mother, Charan Kaur, is expecting comes almost two years after Moose Wala's killing. Charan Kaur is 58, while Moose Wala's father, Balkaur Singh, is 60. Moose Wala was their only child. A file photo of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala with his parents, Balkaur Singh and Charan Kaur. Moose Wala was shot dead in 2022. What drives parents to consider having another child after the loss of their first one, especially at an older age when menopause is typically reached? Is it an attempt to fill the void left by their departed child, or is there a deeper emotional connection driving this decision? Perhaps it's a combination of both. \"One can’t express the feeling in words. As parents, you feel as though something very dear to you is lost,” says 48-year-old Minakshi Singh, a teacher from Bihar’s Muzaffarpur, who lost her 17-year-old son Siddhartha in 2015. Minakshi Singh and her partner immediately planned for another child, and she gave birth to a girl in 2016. She believes that it's her \"Siddhartha born as a daughter\". “I genuinely feel my son has returned in the form of my daughter. When she began speaking, to our surprise, she would identify herself as Siddhartha and claim to have come back because she saw mumma crying,” Minakshi Singh tells IndiaToday.In. And there's a reason why she believes so. “Seeing me manage things between school and home, Siddhartha used to say that it would have been better if I had a girl-child because she would help me with my chores.” Siddhartha, a medical aspirant who would turn 18 in a few months, died by suicide on October 11, 2015, in Rajasthan’s Kota. Rashmi Gupta, a teacher at a school in east Delhi talks about the heartbreak that a former colleague and friend went through after the death of her 10-year-old son due to dengue. \"Asha (name changed to safeguard privacy) was 45 years old then and her entire world crashed. She lost all control of her life and was grieving all the time,\" says Rashmi Gupta, recalling the trauma that the mother went through. \"Though Ankit (name changed to safeguard privacy) was Asha's third child, he was her dearest as he was the youngest. Ankit was born fragile and that is why she was more attached to him,\" says Rashmi Gupta. After two years of his death, when Asha was 47, she gave birth to a boy. \"Call it a miracle, the baby looks exactly like Ankit. It is as if she got her Ankit back,\" says Rashmi Gupta. She, however, doesn't fail to reiterate that the loss of Ankit is still very painful for Asha even after all these years. Forties might still be safe for pregnancy and couples focusing on their careers are otherwise delaying parenthood these days. But it is closer to the 50s and beyond 50, which is when pregnancy becomes much riskier. \"The biological clock is a fact of life. But there's nothing magical about age 35. It's simply an age at which risks become more discussion worthy,\" says the Mayo Clinic website on 'Pregnancy after 35: Healthy pregnancies, healthy babies'. From adoption to surrogacy, there are options but \"a majority of the people who want to go for another child opt for IVF [In vitro fertilisation] under Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART), which involves high risks,\" Dr Smita Roy, a gynaecologist at Tamralipto Government Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata, tells IndiaToday.In. \"The reason is that they want their own child, their own blood and a mother's feelings attached by carrying the baby for nine months in her womb. All risks look small before this feeling,\" adds Dr Smita Roy. Dr Roy shares one such personal incident from years ago. \"One of my MBBS student friends died in an accident, and he was the single child of his parents. After losing the son, his mother longed to have another child at the age of 45. In that case, we suggested she could have a baby through IVF, and she successfully gave birth to a baby,\" she recounts. Health experts can't reiterate enough the risks of the process involved and the additional caution that couples have to take. \"In such cases, couples use IVF only because natural conception is not possible. Fifty-one or fifty-two is the age in India when periods are not normal. Pregnancies at higher ages are difficult as they involve chances of miscarriage, blood pressure and diabetes, and chances of premature deliveries are even higher,\" Dr Ritu Sethi, gynaecologist and Associate Director at Max Hospitals, Gurgaon, tells IndiaToday.In. “We have to make parents who decide to give a second birth after a trauma or death of the first one understand the complications related to late conceptions. We, doctors, have to keep them positive. We advise them to be in constant touch with the doctor in their course of pregnancy,” Dr Ritu Sethi says. While there is a perfect age bracket for pregnancy, there are cases where women have conceived and delivered babies at a much older age. Erramatti Mangamma from Hyderabad made the world record for being the oldest living mother who gave birth at the age of 73 through in-vitro fertilisation and Caesarean section on September 5, 2019. She delivered twin girls, also becoming the oldest mother to give birth to twins. Cases like Mangamma's are more aberrations than being the norm. In older couples, there's a higher risk of pregnancy-related complications and pregnancy loss, according to Mayo Clinic. Even conceiving naturally is difficult. This is where the IVF centres come into the picture with hope in a test tube. “It is really difficult to conceive naturally after the age of 50. By this age, most women start experiencing menopause and, therefore, it becomes impossible to conceive naturally. In the rarest cases, only a woman conceives naturally. Such women do use assisted reproductive technology (ART) for pregnancy,” Dr Kshitiz Murdia, CEO and co-founder of Indira IVF, tells IndiaToday.In. It isn't just about test tube babies, complications are associated with natural pregnancies in older women. “Any woman, especially above 40, will be at risk of higher complication rates, especially of orthopaedic complications. No matter if they go for natural conception or IVF, complications will always be there. When I say higher risks, there are a lot of things that can put them at higher risks and complications. They will be at higher risk of diabetes, hypertension, and some sort of fits. Not just the mother but the baby can also suffer from developmental issues and can develop myalgia,” says Dr Kshitiz. Babies born to older mothers have a higher risk of certain chromosomal conditions, such as Down syndrome, says the Mayo Clinic website. Acknowledging the complexity of the late pregnancy and delivery, Minakshi said she suffered a lot in the process. “Just in few days of delivery, I suffered with Bell's palsy, which is a condition that causes sudden weakness in the muscles on one side of the face.” The death of a child is profoundly devastating and life-altering. There is no one right way or timeline for parents to process grief, and it's natural to long for a way to lessen that pain. “Nothing remains normal under these circumstances when the mother is under the stress and trauma of losing her first child. Above all, her age makes it tough for her to deliver. Her fertility is already low at above 40 years of age and in this case, it's called high-risk pregnancy, which is not safe for the mother and the baby,” says Dr Smita Roy, the Kolkata-based gynaecologist. Minakshi Singh, who lost her 17-year-old son in 2015, was lucky she conceived without medical intervention. “I conceived without any medical support or advice. I lost my son in October 2015 and my daughter was born in July 2016. I still felt it was God's will that I did not have to undergo any treatment and I even tried again, and I could not succeed,” she says. Minakshi Singh shares how the loss and the subsequent pregnancy \"left her broken emotionally and physically\". \"I was so mentally troubled due to the loss of my son and then the pregnancy took a huge toll on my health. I can not express what I went through for two-three years. My liver was damaged for three years due to the high doses of steroids,\" she says. Not everyone is as lucky as Minakshi. For older couples who decide to resort to assisted reproductive technology (ART), it could be a journey of hope and despair as they undergo repeated IVF cycles. This, amid the recent upheaval in their lives due to the loss of a child. Then there could be the added trauma of miscarriage due to advanced age. The government is well aware of the risks of older women getting pregnant with IVF technology and has firm laws and guidelines in place. India's ART law, which came into force on December 20, 2021, imposes a strict age limit for IVF procedures, with guidelines stipulating an age range of 21–50 years for women and 21–55 years for men. Dr Kshitiz Murdia, CEO of Indira IVF, says these regulations need to be adhered to due to associated health risks in women over 50. \"Cases of IVF for advanced-age women keep coming to us where people insist on becoming parents for several reasons, but we strictly follow the guidelines provided under the law. So we don't entertain anybody who is elderly or above 50 years or so. We don't encourage them to conceive or even counsel them. Not just the 50-year-olds, but even if the woman is 48 or 49, we make sure they get fitness tests done,\" says Dr Kshitiz. He also added that since India does not allow the use of ART for anyone who is above 50, Moosewala's parents might have gone abroad for the same. In India, it's not possible due to the stringent laws, he says. \"I have faced such situations three-four times wherein parents of children I delivered requested me to help in conceiving again after losing the child,\" a veteran Delhi-based gynaecologist with decades of practice tells IndiaToday.In. The AIIMS-Delhi-trained doctor requested anonymity. She said she always advised couples against going for another child several years after the previous child. \"By then, the body undergoes a lot of change. Will a near-50-year-old be able to take care of a child like she would have done in her 30s,\" she asks. \"And it isn't just about the mother, think about the child too. If a parent is 50 when a child is born, he or she would be 70 by the child is 20.\" \"I do not know if another baby can really assuage the grief of losing a child,\" says the veteran gynaecologist, adding, \"Ultimately, it is a couple's decision. But they need to make an informed choice.\" Minakshi Singh says, despite the hardships she went through, she views her daughter as \"a beacon of hope and continuity\". Grief is very personal, so is the decision to go for another child, a child of hope. Both should be respected. However, there is the body clock that needs to be taken into account, and, of course, the law too."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story North Indian highways are dotted with \"Pure Veg\" restaurants and \"Shudhh Shakahari bhojnalayas\". Many in India consider vegetarianism the road to good health. The debate keeps popping up regularly on social media, especially during the Navratras, the nine days of worship of Shakti. History and mythology writer Devdutt Pattanaik keeps stirring the veg-non-veg pot. \"One per cent of the 20% vegetarians in India possess 80% of India's wealth. That's the impact of the \"satvik\" diet-hoard like a yaksha. Vegetarians do not let their children eat eggs and meat-eaters give their children healthy food. Observe the difference...,\" author Devdutt Pattanaik wrote recently on Facebook. Several people taunted him, while many others vehemently disagreed with him. India sees a constant and complex debate about \"the ideal food\" for Indians. And, food has always been a touchy issue, with \"what I eat is my business\" being the basis of most arguments. Going beyond this debate, there are two big questions. First, do Indians get enough protein? Second, do we know what food -- cereals or meat -- Indians are increasingly spending more on? The veg-non-veg debate has come up multiple times in multiple places, be it, after a ban on the sale of non-vegetarian food by a civic body, or a film receiving flak and being cancelled for saying, \"Lord Ram consumed meat during his exile\". India is the country with the highest number of vegetarians, both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of the population. \"The vast majority of Indian adults (81%) follow some restrictions on meat in their diet. However, only 39% of Indian adults describe themselves as 'vegetarian',” according to a Pew Research Center survey of 2021. Some proponents of 'pure-veg' and 'satvik' diets have often diet-shamed the ones who eat meat, fish and eggs, for not following the \"ideal diet\". Indian spiritual leaders have long advocated a vegetarian diet rooted in the principle of ahimsa. On the other hand, non-vegetarians have often scoffed at vegetarian takes on biryanis, momos and traditional meat dishes like nihari and kebabs. They brand paneer momos and soya chaap a \"culinary blasphemy\". \"Socio-economic factors, cultural dietary habits, and inadequate access to nutritious foods contribute more significantly to protein deficiency than vegetarianism alone,\" nutritionist Nupuur Patil tells IndiaToday.In. The debate on veg vs non-veg food, rather, focuses on ethics, culture and religion, instead of health, accessibility and affordability. The findings of the recently released All-India Household Consumption Expenditure (HCE) Survey, clubbed with the National Sample Surveys of previous years, show that the expenditure of Indians on animal-based diets has increased in comparison to cereal- and plant-based dietary options. The dietary expenditure trend between 1999-2000 and 2022-2023 suggests that Indians, be it in towns and cities or villages, are increasingly spending more on eggs, fish and meats, over vegetables, pulses (dal) and cereals. The monthly expenditure (per capita) on meats, fish, eggs, and dry fruits has seen an increase. For example, rural India saw an expenditure of 22% of the monthly income on cereals (per capita) in 1999-2000, which came down to 6.90% in 2022-23. Indian cities, too, saw spending on cereals declining steeply (refer to Table 2 for urban data). Not just expenditure on food grains like rice and wheat, but even spending on cereal substitutes like oatmeal and muesli shrunk manifold over the period, for both urban and rural areas. Table 1: Data on expenditure on various categories of food items by rural Indians between 1999 and 2023. Table 2: Data on expenditure on various categories of food items by urban Indians between 1999 and 2023. On the other hand, Indians are spending more money on animal-based diets, and that is clear from the latest data. In rural India, meats, fish and eggs have seen an increase in purchases, from the allocation of 3.32% of monthly income in 1999-2000 to 4.8% in 2022-2023. Expenditure on meats, fish and eggs in Indian cities has also seen an increase, from the allocation of 3.13% of monthly income in 1999-2000 to 3.57% in 2022-2023. The higher share of expenditure in monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) on non-veg items could also be due to higher inflation in meat, fish and eggs as compared to most of the cereals. Prices of rice have gone up by 4.8%, wheat by 5.9%, pulses by 5.2%, vegetables by 6% and milk by 5.3% between 2012 and 2023. However, the annual inflation rate for eggs was 5.2%, chicken 6.6% and mutton 8% in the same period. The price rise is higher for milk and non-vegetarian products. It has to be understood that higher inflation is the result of higher demand for commodities. The emphasis seems to have shifted from plant-based carbohydrates to animal-based proteins. Economist Anitha Rangan calls the focus on protein in diets a \"welcome change\". \"The shift is also due to supply-side factors and the growing purchasing power of people in rural India,\" Anitha Ranjan tells IndiaToday.In. That the Indian diet is heavy on carbohydrates and is protein-deficient is no secret. We place roti and chawal before dal or sambhar. Though non-vegetarian foods are protein-rich, sufficient quantities of pulses in the diet can take care of the daily required protein, say experts. The problem is that people with both vegetarian and non-vegetarian diets are protein-deficient. \"Inherently, there is very little importance to protein-rich foods either due to ignorance or carbohydrate-predominant cereals -- rice and wheat... or even affordability\", according to Professor Madan. Vegetarians might face challenges in obtaining certain essential amino acids, especially if their diet lacks variety, nutritionist Nupuur Patil tells IndiaToday.In. \"However, with a well-planned diet that includes a variety of plant-based protein sources like legumes, nuts, seeds, and dairy, vegetarians can meet their protein needs,\" she says. Non-vegetarian food, including eggs, chicken, fish and meat contain both quantities and quality of proteins. A 100 gram of chicken meat and fish has 15-20 gm of protein, Jagmeet Madan, National President of the Indian Dietetic Association, tells IndiaToday.In. The Indian Dietetic Association (IDA) in 2018 said 84% of Indians with vegetarian diets and 65% with non-vegetarian diets were protein-deficient. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recommends the consumption of one gram of protein per kg of body weight every day. \"India is a country of carbs -- carbohydrate-rich foods are predominant in diets across all regions. The STARCH Study (2014) shows that on average the carbohydrate intake across different regions of India is 60-65% of total calories,\" says Jagmeet Madan. Affordability has a big role to play in our diet choices. \"In India, the maximum number of people are in the lower-income group, so there is a nutritional crisis in the country,\" dietician Rashi Tantia of Faridabad's Metro Hospital tells IndiaToday.In. \"People in the higher income group can still compensate, by including more plant-based proteins. But people in the lower income groups who are vegetarians, struggle with being malnourished. They consume more carbohydrate-rich foods because they can't afford protein-rich foods. Children in the lower income group face more challenges in their nutritional intake because their parents can't afford proper protein food sources for them,\" says dietician Tantia. However, data suggests there is definitely a shift with the increase in spending power. The National Sample Surveys, over the years (between 1999-2000 and 2011-2012), have shown that both rural and urban Indians are increasingly slashing their expenditure on carbohydrate-heavy cereals and increasing expenditure on food from animals, like meat, fish, eggs and milk. Some nutritionists also say that dal cannot be classified as a primary source of protein because it contains more carbohydrates than proteins. As urban and rural expenditure saw a fall in buying pulses, vegetables and milk products, expenditure on eggs, fish and meats went up. It isn't as if the money spent on buying fish, meat and eggs is diverted from the purchase of vegetables and fruits, as the trend might seem to some. \"The increase in expenditure on fish, meat and eggs has no definite link to the decrease in the expenditure on vegetables and fruits\", economist Anitha Rangan tells IndiaToday.In. Also, the less money spent on vegetables and pulses isn't because of rising prices, explains the economist. \"The decline in expenditure on vegetables and pulses cannot be linked to inflation in vegetable prices, but is a result of supply-side factors,\" economist Rangan explained. \"Over the years, the purchasing power of the Indian cities and villages has also increased,\" Anitha Rangan added. The change in the trend should also be attributed to Direct Benefit Transfers (DBTs) initiatives and other government interventions, according to Harsimran Sahni, EVP - Head Treasury, Anand Rathi Global Finance. \"Over the past decade, the difference between rural and urban monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) has decreased from 88% to 69%, indicating that 31% of rural MPCE is now influenced by factors within the rural ecosystem. Government initiatives such as DBT transfers, rural infrastructure development, and support for farmers have played a crucial role in improving rural livelihoods,\" Harsimran Sahni tells IndiaToday.In. With these changes over the past two decades, Indians seem to be going for animal-based diet sources, while the expenditure on plant-based diets is dropping. As the \"ideal food\" debate goes on, Indians are now opening their wallets and revealing their dietary preferences."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Credit cards have become more than just a convenient mode of payment; they have evolved into a means of financial freedom and accessibility. However, for many individuals, like 25-year-old Rohan (name changed), the allure of credit cards has led them down a perilous path of debt and financial distress. When Rohan got himself a credit card, little did he know that it would land him in a never-ending cycle of EMI payments. What began with Rohan fulfilling his aspirations – purchasing a TV, laptop, and smartphone – quickly spiralled into a nightmare of mounting debts and constant struggle. \"I got a credit card mainly to purchase some electronic items, like a TV, a laptop, and a phone,\" Rohan confessed. \"Since many online shopping sites offered zero-interest EMIs and I could earn rewards and cashbacks on top of it, it seemed like a smart thing to do.\" “I have not been able to completely pay off my credit card outstanding balance and have been paying just the minimum amount for the past few months,” he said. Like Rohan, millions of Indians have become addicted to credit cards and are fighting a constant battle to avoid defaulting on their EMIs. Credit card spending has skyrocketed to alarming levels in India, and so have the defaults. This comes at a time when getting a credit card has become easier than ever before, with banks and financial institutions aggressively promoting their offerings to consumers across the country. For many, the power to purchase ends in a nightmare, with some even opting to go for personal loans to pay off credit card dues. India has adopted credit cards at a staggering pace. Just a decade ago, credit cards were a rarity, with stringent eligibility criteria and low levels of financial inclusion hindering their widespread adoption. Data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) shows that there were less than 2 crore (1,76,72,337) active credit cards in India as of December 2011 and the figure increased to just over 2 crore (2,03,62,859) by the end of 2014. A slight rise in three years. The number of active credit cards in India did not cross 3 crore in the next two years. By the end of 2018, the number of active cards was at 4.4 core. Though credit card numbers in 2018 had more than doubled in comparison to 2011, it was nothing compared to the boom that was seen between 2019 and 2023. During this period, there has been a significant rise in the number of active credit cards in the country – from 5.5 crore (5,53,32,847) as of December 2019 to almost 10 crore (9,95,00,257) as of January 2024. This represents an 81% increase in the number of active credit cards in the country. In 2023 alone, over 1.6 crore credit cards were issued, compared to 1.2 crore credit cards added a year earlier. The staggering growth of active credit cards and users in India. (Source: RBI) A report prepared by PWC in 2022 highlighted that the credit card industry in India had witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% in the past five years. It also highlighted that in May 2022 – right about the time when the Indian economy was rebounding from the Covid-19 pandemic – overall credit card spending reached its highest-ever number of Rs 1.3 lakh crore. So, along with the number of credit cards issued, the spending through them was zooming too. Credit card spending hit a fresh record high in October 2023 when it reached Rs 1.72 lakh crore. And in the past three months, Indians have spent nearly Rs 5 lakh crore via credit cards – nearly 2% of India’s total GDP. This also indicates that the average ticket size of borrowing through credit cards has gone up significantly. While the post-Covid spending frenzy has provided a significant push to credit card adoption and spending, there are bigger factors at play. The PWC report suggested that the emergence of e-commerce, adoption of contactless payments and changes in the value proposition, the post-pandemic credit card space has undergone a considerable change and is evolving constantly. It noted that credit card adoption could grow at almost thrice the speed in the next four years. With greater credit card adoption and rising spends, defaults are rising too. In 2022-23, credit card defaults stood at Rs 4,072 crore, which was over Rs 950 crore higher than the default of Rs 3,122 crore in 2021-22. This alarming trend has attracted the Reserve Bank’s attention as well . Days after credit card spending hit a record high in October 2023, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said it was monitoring some components of personal or unsecured loans to identify stress. “Certain components of personal loans are, however, recording very high growth. These are being closely monitored by the Reserve Bank for any signs of incipient stress,” Shaktikanta Das said. His remark came amid a period where banks were broadening their unsecured lending portfolios, particularly in response to escalated credit card expenditures. Despite the RBI’s warning and efforts to slow down unsecured lending, the bulk of credit card loans by banks have been to relatively riskier borrowers. RBI economists in an analysis on retail credit flows highlighted that in November 2023, the outstanding credit card balance of banks rose 34% from a year earlier. It rose to Rs 2.4 lakh crore, accounting for 5% of total retail loans. \"In the case of credit cards, per live borrower credit outstanding is higher for the below-prime borrowers, suggesting a higher flow of credit to relatively riskier borrowers,\" the RBI economists wrote in the research paper titled, ‘Dynamics of Credit Growth in the Retail Segment: Risk and Stability Concerns’. Nilesh Tribhuvann, Founder & Managing Partner, White & Brief, Advocates & Solicitors, pointed out that the surge in credit card exposure underscores the evolving consumer behaviour after the Covid-19 pandemic. “Despite the RBI's risk weight adjustments on unsecured loans, credit card issuance is nearing the million milestone and is at 9.95 crore cards. HDFC Bank, with over two crore cards, maintains its lead among issuers. As legal advisors, we closely monitor this trend, recognising the delicate balance between increased spending and potential default risks,\" he added. While there's an increase in credit card defaulters, it’s only a fraction compared to the people who are stuck in a never-ending loop of monthly repayments, just like 25-year-old Rohan. “I think credit cards and online shopping can be a dangerous combination if used irresponsibly, as they can lead to a debt trap,” Rohan told IndiaToday.In. “Debt can quickly accumulate and become unmanageable. That’s why I’m always cautious about using my credit card,” he added. Most people who purchase using credit cards usually get lured by lucrative offers like no-cost or low-cost EMI, which are applicable on almost all products online and even at physical stores. These offers lead to a lot of impulse buying, and the outstanding balance keeps growing. What’s worse is that after a period of time, the interest rate on the due amount keeps compounding. And when people opt to pay the 'minimum balance due' instead of the total due for the month, they fall deeper into a debt trap, resulting in defaults, low-credit scores and even harassment. This is what happened to Sohom (name changed) when he got his first credit card. “This was after I passed out of college and went to Mumbai for work. Sustenance in the megacity was tough with my meagre income. I was offered a credit card along with the new salary account,” he told IndiaToday.in. Soham used his credit card to fund his gym expenses and even bought a new iPhone. “I used my credit card with the limit of Rs 1.5 lakh. As expenses grew, so did my dues to the bank. Most months I would pay just the minimum due amount,” he added. But as the payment burden grew, he started missing the payments. “The bank started making calls, pressure was mounting. It was my mistake. It's a temptation. Before things got out of hand, I took a personal loan from the same bank to clear the outstanding,” he recalled. Soham's taking a personal loan to pay off credit card dues, though an extreme step, makes sense when interest rates are compared. Typically, personal loan interest rates range from 10.5% to 44%, depending on factors like credit history, borrowing track record, loan amount, and borrower's income. However, the woes are compounded in the case of credit cards when people don't pay the entire monthly due amount or default on payments. While the average interest rate on most credit cards ranges from 3.6% to 4%, this is only applicable when individuals clear their monthly dues in full. If a credit card user doesn't pay at all or opts to pay the minimum amount due, interest is charged by banks daily on the outstanding balance. This is why people paying minimum dues often see that their outstanding balance rises in the next month or remains almost stagnant. Soham faced a similar situation with another credit card he used to own. Luckily for him, he managed to borrow money from a friend and clear the dues. There are countless examples of people who regret their decision to pay minimum dues on their credit card expenses. Arijit (name changed) told IndiaToday.in that he also kept paying a bit more than the monthly minimum due for some time, following which the outstanding amount jumped to almost Rs 85,000. “I kept paying just the minimum dues or just a bit more than that. I kept doing that for a while. It felt like the amount had compounded overnight,” he said. As India grapples with its growing credit card culture, stories like Rohan's, Sohom's, and Arijit's highlight the risks involved. While credit cards offer convenience, they can easily lead to a debt trap."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story It's Holi! Let the music and thandai flow. And for that Holi high, there's bhang. Legally available, socially acceptable. If one doesn't like bhang in the cardamom-flavoured thandai, there are a lot of options to choose from these days. From bhang-infused chocolates and cakes to cookies and butter. And, we aren't talking about hash brownies here. It's all about bhang. This doesn't involve any wild search. In this age of ecommerce, bhang products are just a click away. Why is bhang, which is made from the leaves and stem of the cannabis plant, legal, whereas ganja and hash, extracted from buds and seeds of the same plant, illegal? Not just legal, bhang has social and cultural acceptance too. In fact, bhang is an important, if not essential, part of Holi and Shivratri celebrations. So, what is the 'Big Bhang Theory' all about? But before we proceed, a word of caution. Be it colours, sweets, music, 'masti' and bhang -- moderation is the key. Thandai is a sweet drink prepared by mixing milk, dry fruits, and spices, garnished with almonds, pistachio & saffron. (Image: Unsplash: Jyoti Singh) Holi, the festival of colours, has to be India's most vibrant and exuberant affair. And, it is bhang, which makes some glide past the day-long festivities, involving catching up with friends, feasting, singing, dancing and getting a good night's sleep at the end. A high that even a traditional Indian family would not mind. \"Hailing from Uttar Pradesh, my entire family would mandatorily have bhang thandai on Holi and Shivratri. My parents had no issue with me having bhang,\" says content editor Krishna, who takes micro-doses of bhang, tells IndiaToday.In. \"Bhang has been a weekend thing for me for the last four years,\" says the 32-year-old Krishna who is now based in Himachal Pradesh. Devdutt Pattanaik, author of books on mythology, commented on the significance of bhang and why it is consumed on Holi. \"It's Holi. Traditionally we drank bhang. Offered it to Shiva, to Balarama. To take away the heat of materialistic poison. To relax rather than be relentlessly competitive,\" wrote Devdutt Pattanaik on X on Monday (March 25). Author Devdutt Pattanaik's post on X on the significance of bhang. While the mere mention of alcohol might raise eyebrows or land one in trouble, it isn't so for bhang. \"I am here to pre-order bhang for my entire family, including my sons. Bhang thandai is a must in Holi,\" a customer outside the Government Bhang Theka in Noida tells IndiaToday.In. If having bhang thandai with friends and family is socially acceptable, Indian laws make it legal too. Yes, it's perfectly legal to consume bhang, unlike its siblings ganja and hash. Though all of them are derived from the same cannabis plant. The cultural significance of bhang is reflected in India's cannabis laws. While bhang, derived from the cannabis plant, has cultural and social acceptance and legal backing, other derivatives like weed and hash are illegal. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, clearly demarcates that the seed, fibre and leaf are all exempted from being branded 'narcotic'. Bhang is extracted from the leaves and stems of the cannabis plant. The Karnataka high court in August 2022 ruled that \"bhang is not declared a prohibited drug or drink under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and granted bail to a man who was caught with almost 29 kg of bhang and some ganja. The Karnataka high court referred to two earlier judgments -- Madhukar versus State of Maharashtra and Arjun Singh vs State of Haryana -- where it was ruled that bhang wasn't ganja and didn't come under the NDPS Act. The court observed that bhang is a traditional drink and sold in lassi shops like all other drinks. It also said that bhang was sold in the market with branded names. Although marijuana shrubs are commonly found in most parts of India, bhang is sold through government-licensed shops in states like Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. In some nurseries in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, the cannabis plant can be bought for Rs 50 a piece. \"Babaji ki booti hai, madam. Le jaiye,\" a Noida nursery staffer tried selling a cannabis plant to a colleague during her recent visit. The acceptance of bhang flows from ancient Indian texts. Bhang consumption has heavy cultural and social backing in India. The use of cannabis in India dates back thousands of years, with mentions in ancient texts like the Atharvaveda. In these scriptures, cannabis is referred to as \"bhang\" and is often associated with healing properties and spiritual enlightenment. When the oceans churned, it unearthed many treasures, including the remedy of immortality, amrita. As drops of amrita fell on the earth, they made way for the cannabis sprouts to grow where they landed, according to the scriptures. Mention of Bhang in Atharva Veda \"We praise the five (plant) kingdoms, foremost in Soma's opposition. May Darbha grass, Bhang, and Barley not forsake us in our need,\" says Book 11 of Atharvaveda. \"Only a non-Hindu would ask, 'Can you prove that Shivji took bhang or ganja or cannabis?' Hindus know this is a traditional offering to the supreme hermit, indicative of his Bhole-nath status,\" author Devdutt Pattanaik remarked in a Facebook post in 2019. There are mentions of bhang in the Charak Samhita as well, according to content editor Krishna. A photo of bhang drinkers in Khandesh (parts of present-day MP and Maharashtra) from the 1893 Indian Hemp Drugs Commission report. Some believe that the consumption of bhang is a way of \"connecting with the divine\" and \"attaining higher states of consciousness\". Bhang forms a part of Shivratri 'prasad' and is often associated with Lord Shiva, the God of destruction and transformation. According to mythology, Shiva once left his abode after a disagreement with his wife Parvati. He stopped to rest amid a small patch of dense trees and quickly fell asleep. After a while, awakened by hunger and unease, he ate some of the leaves of the tree under which he slept. The leaves left him revitalised and invigorated. Those were said to be leaves of the cannabis plant. With Shiva's blessing, bhang gained a pride of place in Indian pop culture. The social acceptance of bhang could be aptly attributed to its entry into films and songs. It is deeply ingrained in India's cultural fabric, where its portrayal in cinema, music, and festivals has cemented its social coolness. Bhang has also been celebrated in Hindi film songs, film historian Avijit Ghosh tells IndiaToday.In. \"Dilip Kumar drank and danced delightfully to the song, 'Mere pairon mein ghunghroo bandha de' (film: Sunghursh, 1968) which begins with the lines: 'Dil paya albela maine, tabiyat meri rangeeli, haai aaj khushi mein maine bhaiyya, thodi si bhang pee lee',\" says Ghosh. \"Rajesh Khanna went on a high and lip-synced another popular track, 'Nadiya se dariya, dariya se sagar' in Namak Haram (1973). The word used in the song is “jam\" (alcohol), but the actual drink served in the film is thandai, bhang-laced cold sherbet,\" Avijit Ghosh tells IndiaToday.In. \"A key reason behind the box-office success of Amitabh Bachchan’s Don was the desi foot-tapping number, 'Khaike paan Banaraswala', which was among the most popular numbers of 1978. The song was filmed in a working-class area and starts with the line, 'Arrey bhang ka rang jama ho chakachak, phir lo paan chabaye',\" says Ghosh, the author of 'When Ardh Satya Met Himmatwala'. With these precedents, a wasted Avi (played by Aditya Roy Kapoor) splashes Scholar Naina (played by Deepika Padukone) with a glass of bhang in the 2013 film 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani'. The bhang high is pictured in the song 'Balam pichkari', which is now a must-play at all Holi parties. Deepika Padukone and Ranbir Kapoor dance to 'Balam Pichkari' in Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013). Just like popular Bollywood music, folk music also has a heavy dose of bhang references, especially in those old-school Holi Milans. Bhang is consumed in many forms in India. It is savoured as cookies and burfis, licked as cannabis butter, and drunk as thandai and lassi. It's an Indian export to the world. The most fascinating aspect of bhang is the forms in which Indians consume it. Whether consumed as a beverage, mixed with sweets, or infused into savoury snacks, bhang offers a perfect fix. From thandai (a traditional milk-based drink) to bhang lassis and pakoras, the possibilities are endless. Affordability is another factor why bhang is popular even on non-festive days. \"We got wet bhang golis for instant consumption or lassi, as well as a powdered one, which could be used to make cakes and cookies. A small goli sells for Rs 5, while the powdered bhang costs Rs 280 a kilo,\" said the man at the Government Bhang Shop in Noida's Sector 15. Being a cheap and easy source of buzz, also makes it vulnerable to adulteration. Hence, the quality and safety of bhang is essential to prevent adverse health effects. \"The greener, the better,\" says Gurgaon-based Shikhar, who calls himself a bhang enthusiast. \"Also, when you bring the bhang paste home to make thandai or lassi, it is advisable to strain it properly, because the bhang paste may contain some solid impurities like soil and straws,\" added Shikhar, a 29-year-old marketing professional. Indians like to experiment and bhang is no exception. It's no more about being gulped down as thandai or had as 'gola', a whole range of bhang-infused food items like chocolates, cakes, cookies and butter are now available. And they are just a click away. Bhang products can be now be ordered online through e-commerce portals. What more, websites dedicated to bhang and associated food products have also sprung up. Bhang cakes and cookies on sale. (Image: Aqua Herbals) With changing attitudes towards cannabis and growing interest in its medicinal and recreational potential, the Indian cannabis industry is poised for significant growth. \"If we get good marketing, it will go from being the taboo plant to being the wonder plant really soon,\" Srijan Sharma, co-founder of ItsHemp said in India Today Conclave 2022. \"India has the potential to have a billion-dollar cannabis industry,\" Srijan Sharma outlined at the India Today Conclave. From innovative products like brownies to incorporating cannabis into the mainstream, the possibilities are vast. Until then, it's all laughs and fun, with a glass of bhang. Just keep in mind, moderation is the key! (This article has been updated to incorporate author Devdutt Pattanaik's comments on Holi and bhang)"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story If not for Aurangzeb, his brother Dara Shikoh would have ascended the Mughal throne in Delhi. At least their father, Shah Jahan, believed so. After the death of Emperor Shah Jahan in 1658, Dara Shikoh was killed on Aurangzeb's orders and his body, tied to an elephant, was paraded along the roads of Shahjahanabad. Just like the memory of Dara Shikoh, his grave was lost too. Until a municipal officer discovered the grave of Shah Jahan's liberal heir apparent among many marked and unmarked Mughal graves in Delhi in 2020. Sanjeev Kumar Singh, an engineer at South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), attracted praise from the likes of Irfan Habib, BR Mani and KK Muhammad, for the find. Singh laboured tirelessly for 4 years to trace Dara Shikoh's grave. However, the lost-and-found story of Dara Shikoh's grave is a rarity. Numerous Indian monuments have gone missing or are lost from their physical existence forever. So much so that not even a photo is available of them in the public domain. Some have even been erased from public consciousness. Many locals could not point to Delhi's Barakhambha cemetery, a monument that was recently declared untraceable or 'lost' . The Barakhamba Cemetery in Delhi, once on the list of 'Monuments of National Importance', was not the only one that had been delisted by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the caretaker of India's historical monuments. Along with it, a Kos Minar in Faridabad's Mujessar village in Haryana, Gunner Burkill’s tomb in Jhansi, a cemetery at Gaughat in Lucknow, and the Telia Nala Buddhist ruins in Varanasi were removed from the list of monuments of 'national importance' because they were untraceable. They are among the 18 monuments to be delisted from the ASI's list of 3,693 centrally protected monuments because their location, or their current physical state, is not known. In fact, the Centre told Parliament last year that a total of 50 monuments were untraceable . One of India's 49 Kos Minars on Ajmer-Kakaria Road in Kakariya, Rajasthan (Image: PM-EAC report) In the case of the Telia Nala Buddhist ruins, a part of a deserted village in Uttar Pradesh's Varanasi, not even a photo is available in the public domain. A Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report in 2022 noted that houses had been built on the historical site. It was a similar tale of loss in Uttarakhand's Almora. The ASI couldn't find the 8th century Kutumbari temple. The temple came under ASI protection in 1915. Over time, the temple's condition deteriorated and only ruins of the structure remained. Mysteriously, around the year 2000, the ruins of the temple could no longer be found. In 2018, the temple was put on the \"untraceable\" list of the ASI. The ASI later found that the remains of the temple were taken away by villagers to build their houses. As per a survey by the Dehradun circle of the ASI, the temple has now become a part of courtyards, verandas, doors of the houses of the locals. Around half a dozen houses in Dwarahat were found to have some or other part of the temple. Such incidents are, however, not isolated, said Nakul Chhabra, who organises heritage walks and awareness campaigns through his initiative 'Delhi Roots'. Chhabra said during one such walk, he found a heritage enthusiast carrying a 2,000-year-old brick dating back to the Kushan age along with him. \"He said it was from a mound near his village in Mewat. It could have been from an abandoned old building, roughly dating back to the 1st century to 3rd century CE. He even told me that people from nearby villages come there to pick up bricks to build their houses,\" Chhabra said. Bibek Debroy, the head of the committee that submitted the report 'Monuments of National Importance -- The Urgent Need for Rationalisation', explained the ill-fate of the Indian monuments using a quote by Oscar Wilde. Quoting Wilde's 'The Importance of Being Earnest', Bibek Debroy wrote in The Indian Express in 2023, \"ASI’s monumental performance transcends both misfortune and carelessness. The agency has lost 24 monuments. They are untraceable.\" We are losing monuments that are thousands of years old and are part of the nation's identity, history and heritage. Just like Dara Shikoh's grave, the Tamluk Rajbari (palace), believed to be established in the 5th century BC by the Mayuradha dynasty, is at its last stage of disappearance in Bengal. A horse stable overgrown with weeds is what lies at the site that had a major contribution to India's struggle for Independence, as per a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report. The rajbari was a refuge for our freedom fighters. In fact, in 1938, Raja Surendra Narayan Roy cut down an entire mango orchard within the rajbari to create space for a meeting of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and other revolutionaries. Legend has it that the site is also linked to the swayamvar sabha of queen Draupadi in the epic Mahabharata. (Image: CAG Report) In Delhi, cattle sheds abound in Zamrudpur village, near Lady Shri Ram College, which houses a lot of gumbads, baradaris, and gumtis dating back to the late mediaeval period. However, there have also been instances where structures on the verge of being wiped out from history have been restored and declared monuments of 'national importance'. The Anang Tal baoli, a stepwell believed to have been built a thousand years ago by King Anang Pal II, who is considered as the founder of Delhi, was declared a monument of national importance in 2022. Delhi was then referred to as Dhilli or Dhillika. The move came after the CAG, in a review report, found that sewage from nearby areas was being discharged into the reservoir and the remains of the structure were in a neglected state. However, restoration work is yet to be started. The heritage stepwell holds immense historical significance and an excavation carried out by the ASI between 1992 and 1995 revealed a sequence of two cultural periods -- the Rajput period and the Sultanate period (11-12th century). BR Mani, former Additional Director-General of ASI, in his book 'Delhi, Threshold of the Orient: Studies in Archaeological Investigations', said that a notable feature of the tank was the presence of incised mason marks like a swastika, a trident on the stone blocks used in the reservoir's construction. These marks were found in Madhya Pradesh's Bhojpur temple, from the same period, as well as in the stone slabs in the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque, the first mosque to be built in Delhi using rubble masonry, near Qutub Minar, Mani said in his book. The Anang Tal baoli in Delhi. (Image: CAG Report) But, what leads to these monuments going 'missing'? A New Delhi-based archaeologist, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told IndiaToday.in that lack of public awareness about our built heritage and culture was a major reason for the degradation of monuments and historical sites in India. \"People need something to connect to a structure or a site, until then, it is just a public place ready to be encroached upon. Several mediaeval monuments are under encroachment in the Delhi-NCR region. If a national capital fails to protect these structures, what do we expect from the suburban and rural areas?\" the archaeologist said. A tomb that was dug up by villagers in Pinangwan in Haryana's Nuh district. (Image: Nakul Chhabra) Nakul Chhabra, who organises heritage walks, said during his visit to Pinangwan in Haryana's Nuh district, he found that villagers had dug up an unknown tomb thinking there might be valuable things under the cenotaph. In 2013, the CAG had surveyed 1,655 protected monuments, comprising 45% of the total 3,693 monuments, and found 92 missing. It was more than 2.5 times the number being provided by the Culture Ministry since 2006. Apart from reasons like encroachment, urbanisation and shortage of manpower to monitor the structures, the CAG report has also pulled up the Culture Ministry for negligence while the monuments go \"missing\". An example of this is the story of British brigadier General Nicholson's statue, which was a protected monument near Delhi's Kashmere Gate at the time of Independence in 1947. The statute was gifted by the then Indian government to Ireland in the 1960s, but the ASI was unaware of the transfer, and it continues to be on its list of protected monuments. To prevent further monuments from going 'missing', Vineet Bhanwala, the founder of Heritage Haryana Foundation that engages in heritage walks, said it was important for the government to engage the locals and raise awareness about them. He said that most centrally protected monuments lack fencing, making it easy for cattle to graze, and miscreants to occupy them in the dark and engage in anti-social activities. \"I have seen several havelis with beautiful intricate murals in Bhiwani and Hisar painted over in the recent past. The locals must be made aware of the perks of tourism as a source of earnings. If the local youth get employed in tourism and related activities, the anti-social activities will vanish as well,\" Bhanwala said. India, one of the world's oldest civilisations, boasts a wealth of historical structures. If this \"historical wealth\" is not preserved, the country's monuments may get lost in time."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The prized Pakistani port city of Gwadar was just a little sleepy town of fishermen and traders until the Chinese 'blessed' it. The hammer-shaped fishing village now houses Pakistan's third-largest port, a tainted Chinese gift. Gwadar, however, wasn't always with Pakistan. It was under Omani rule for almost 200 years, until the 1950s. Before Gwadar finally ended up in Pakistani possession in 1958, it was actually offered to India, which the Indian government under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru declined. Gwadar had been in the possession of the Sultan of Oman, since 1783. The upcoming Lok Sabha polls recently brought back one of India's strategic 'blunders', the handover of Katchatheevu island to Sri Lanka . The allegation thrown by the BJP at the Congress, of undermining India's territorial interests in the case of Katchatheevu, follows a series of previous allegations. However, unlike the Kashmir \"blunder\", the \"acceptance of Tibet as a part of China\" (1953 and 2003) and the Katchatheevu giveaway (1974), the turning down of the Gwadar offer isn't common knowledge and hasn't become part of India's political discourse. \"Not accepting the priceless gift from the Sultan of Oman was a huge mistake at par with the long list of post-Independence strategic blunders,\" Brigadier Gurmeet Kanwal (Retd) noted in a 2016 opinion piece 'The historic blunder of India no one talks about'. This story of Gwadar changing hands multiple times, gives rise to some obvious questions. How did a small fishing town end up with the Omani Sultan, across the narrow Gulf of Oman? Why did the Government of India, with Jawaharlal Nehru at its helm, decline to accept the port town? What would have happened had India taken possession of Gwadar in 1956? Located on the Makran coast of Pakistan's Balochistan province, Gwadar first came into Omani possession in 1783. The Khan of Kalat, Mir Noori Naseer Khan Baloch, gifted the area to Muscat's prince, Sultan bin Ahmad. \"Both prince Sultan and the Khan of Kalat had an understanding that if the prince ascended the throne of Oman, he would return Gwadar to the latter,\" Pramit Pal Chaudhuri, the South Asia head of Eurasia Group, tells IndiaToday.In. The city's notable landmark, the Omani Qila, and some buildings in the Shahi Bazar are surviving imprints of Omani rule in the region. 1. An illustration of Gwadar in 1863, from the magazine 'The Illustrated London News' . (Image: Getty) 2. A surviving building from Omani rule in the old city of Gwadar, Balochistan, Pakistan. (Image: Getty) Peshukan and Sur Bander, two other fishing villages adjoining Gwadar on the Pakistani coast, were also in Omani possession. Sultan Bin Ahmad kept Gwadar as his base for raids on Arabia, across the coast, until 1792, till he got hold of what he was eyeing for, the throne of Muscat. But, Gwadar was not returned to the Khan's Khanate, breeding a thorn of contention between the two. There were further proposals between 1895 and 1904, both by the Khan of Kalat and the Government of (British) India to purchase Gwadar from the Omanis, but no decision was reached, according to archivist Martin Woodward's article ' Gwadar: The Sultan's Possession '. From 1763, Gwadar was administered by a British assistant political agent, but the Khan of Kalat frequently demanded Gwadar be handed over to him amid indications of oil reserves in the region. In the meantime, the Sultan of Oman also kept negotiating with the British about the potential handover, in lieu of military and financial help against rebels, according to the letters of correspondence between the two. Notably, it was the same Kalat Khanate that ruled Balochistan, until it was annexed by the newly independent Pakistan, under Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in March 1948. \"Most of Balochistan was absorbed by Pakistan in 1948 but the coastal strip around Gwadar, called Makran, did not accede until 1952,\" Pramit Pal Chaudhuri tells IndiaToday.In. Gwadar still remained outside Pakistani control. It was at this juncture that the Sultan of Oman extended the offer of sale to India – a deal, if done, could have altered the South Asian geopolitical dynamics and history. \"According to private conversations with two Indian diplomats who were familiar with the records, the Sultan of Oman offered Gwadar to Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru,\" Pramit Pal Chaudhuri, a former member of the National Security Advisory Board, tells IndiaToday.In. \"After Independence, according to the diplomatic community grapevine, Gwadar was administered by India on behalf of the Sultan of Oman as the two countries enjoyed excellent relations,\" wrote Brigadier Gurmeet Kanwal (Retd), in his 2016 piece. \"I believe the offer came in 1956. Jawaharlal Nehru turned it down and in 1958, Oman sold Gwadar to Pakistan for 3 million pounds,\" adds Pramit Pal Chaudhuri. This offer was probably made verbally, according to Brigadier Gurmeet Kanwal (Retd). \"The National Archives has documents and some newspaper articles on the Gwadar debate, but the views of the Indian officials are redacted,\" says Pramit Pal Chaudhuri. In fact, India's Jain community was interested in purchasing Gwadar from Oman. \"Declassified documents by the British government reveal that the Jain community in India also offered to purchase Gwadar. The Jain community possessed great wealth and could offer a good price,\" wrote Azhar Ahmad in his paper 'Gwadar: A Historical Kaleidoscope' . \"In 1958, after learning that the Indians were also trying to purchase Gwadar, the government of Pakistan intensified its efforts and succeeded in concluding an agreement with the British government on August 1, 1958,\" added Azhar, based on a 2016 conversation with Akram Zaki, Pakistan's former secretary general of foreign affairs who served as an ambassador to China and the United States. Gwadar was transferred from Oman to British control, subsequently passing to Pakistan. Given the historical involvement of the British in the correspondence between the Khan of Kalat (under British suzerainty) and the Omanis, the British acted as intermediaries in the handover. Even though the British let go its colonies, they had their presence in the region to counter the Soviets. However, then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru did not reach the decision to reject the Omani offer of Gwadar by himself. The decision to reject the Omani offer was dictated by the circumstances too. \"The then Foreign Secretary, Subimal Dutt and probably the Indian Intelligence Bureau chief, B N Mullick, recommended against accepting the Sultan's offer,\" national security expert Pramit Pal Chaudhuri tells IndiaToday.In. Had Nehru accepted and bought Gwadar, it would have been an Indian enclave in Pakistan without any land access. The situation would have been similar to what Pakistan faced logistically with East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). \"The argument was that Gwadar was indefensible from any attack by Pakistan. Given Nehru was still hoping to work out an amiable relationship with Pakistan, having an enclave like Gwadar was probably seen as a pointless provocation,\" explains Pramit Pal Chaudhuri. Today, almost 65 years later, the decline of the \"priceless gift from the Sultan of Oman\", might look like a diplomatic blunder, while others might be of the notion that it was a nuanced and pragmatic thing to do at that point in time. Debates apart, what did India let go of? Probably not just the hammer-shaped hamlet of fishermen. Aerial view of Gwadar and the port, from 2013, that came up with Chinese investment in Pakistan. (Image: Getty) Gwadar, the strategic port overlooking the Gulf of Oman, has long piqued the interest of global powers. Pakistan had long been surveying Gwadar to develop it as a deepwater port, but it finally became a reality only in 2008. Gwadar's metamorphosis to a strategic linchpin was a result of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The Chinese were looking to bypass the Strait of Malacca, which China uses for 80% of its energy imports. To overcome the vulnerable chokepoint at Malacca, it came up with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Map 1: Strait of Malacca between Sumatra (Indonesia) and Malaysia. (Source: Maritime security cooperation in the Strait of Malacca, Anthony S Massey) Map 2: Highway Networks of CPEC. (Source: US Institute of Peace) Note: Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, Gilgit Baltistan and Aksai Chin are integral parts of India. The “Crown Jewel” of Gwadar, thus, emerged as the cornerstone of the CPEC, whose rail lines and motorways would start at Gwadar, traverse Pakistan upwards north to reach Kashgar in China's Xingiang. The CPEC has been vehemently opposed by India as it passes through Indian territory that Pakistan has illegally occupied. The $45.6-billion infrastructure and energy project, since 2015, has, however, been marred by incomplete projects and protests by the Balochis. \"The windfall infrastructure 'Game Changer' boom (Gwadar) has so far robbed many of Balochi livelihoods,\" notes Patial RC, a retired Indian Army officer in a 2023 ' EurasiaReview' opinion piece. \"Despite the top leadership from both countries getting involved to keep things on track, it all (the CEPC) appears to be going slow,\" added Patial RC, involved in counter-insurgency operations in Sri Lanka. The people of Balochistan, where Gwadar is located, see the CPEC as another attempt by Pakistan, aided by China, to extract the mineral wealth of Pakistan's poorest province without developing it. That is why Gwadar and its Chinese assets have seen widespread attacks in the recent past by Balochi insurgents and separatists. Voilent attacks on Pakistani and Chinese assets have seen an uptick in recent years. The Chabahar port in Iran, less than 200 km to Gwadar's west, was thus developed by India to counter the Chinese presence in the region. Through the Chabahar port and the Zaranj-Delaram Highway, India intended to connect to Afghanistan and the Central Asian Republics (the stans), given Pakistan, China and the mighty Himalayas come in the way of a land trade route. The opening of the pilot trade programme between Pakistan and China, in November 2016. Pakistan's weak economy was confident of the CPEC bailing out its economic woes. (Image: Aamir Qureshi/AFP) This brings us to a more important question. If India under Jawaharlal Nehru had accepted it, had Gwadar yielded any favourable outcomes for India's strategic and economic interests? \"If India had bought Gwadar from Oman, it would have been defensible but for only a short period of time,\" Pramit Pal Chaudhuri tells IndiaToday.In. Gwadar's geography and topography, though strategic, are also its Achilles' Heel. Gwadar rests upon a promontory resembling a hammer, linked by a thin isthmus (800 metres wide) to the mainland, obstructing military access. \"The city would need to be supplied by sea or air, which would have been difficult for India at the time,\" says Chaudhuri. However, national security expert Pramit Pal Chaudhuri believes that the \"enclave would have been more useful as a diplomatic bargaining chip over a more important dispute like Kashmir\". \"Hindsight is a wonderful thing,\" sang Lily Williams. The decision to reject the Omani offer of Gwadar was taken, keeping the realities of that time in mind. Today, Gwadar is on a list like Katchatheevu, just that it is not discussed at all."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story When Bhavna Chaddha, legal head at the Claridges Hotels and Resorts, shifted to her four-BHK flat in Greater Noida six months back, one of her priority areas was having an elegant puja room. She converted the flat's study into a worship room with the help of an interior designer. Even after six months, she is still developing and adding to the coveted space. It's like a pilgrim's work in progress. Our homes have evolved, and so has the small corner that houses the deities. Even those who don't perform puja rituals daily are going for exquisite puja cabinets and corners in their flats. For interior designers, the puja room is now as important as the kitchen, if not more. And well, at times you might not even find an idol at all in the puja room. Not only the puja room, even items used for rituals have undergone a huge change -- from a wick that burns from dawn to dusk to havan cups to incense sticks made from temple flowers. Innovations, a changing psyche and the rise in incomes have changed our puja rooms. Puja rooms or corners in our houses devoted to mandirs, which were traditionally made of metal or wood, have always been at the centre of our lives. That's where the silent prayers are made to the household deity before an exam or a job interview. It is also where the family stands together with folded hands singing prayer hymns, especially during the Navratris. It is the same devotion with which people like the 31-year-old Bhawna Chaddha are setting up new puja rooms, just that they have more trendy and innovative options to choose from now. \"We wanted the theme of an open mandir and a fusion of modern with traditional. We have a wall-mounted, open mandir with a traditional north Indian shikhara, while the shelves have individual lights focusing on the idols,\" Bhawna tells IndiaToday.In. “We are completing the puja room with a lot of love and devotion, and it will take time. We plan to have bells too, like in temples,\" adds Bhawna. Bhawna Chaddha's open temple has a shikhara and is a work in progress. The idols are of silver. The modern era has ushered in a shift in how puja rooms are designed. These elegant spaces prioritise functionality while maintaining a serene atmosphere. Wall-mounted shelves or built-in cabinets serve as efficient storage for idols and puja accessories and also add to the overall look of the flat. Delhi-based interior designer Tarandeep Kaur explains why and how the puja rooms have changed. “People are mostly living in flats and small houses. Ten years back, puja units used to be very typical, like just in a corner somewhere with the seating on the floor. Nowadays, people are making units which are more trendy,” Tarandeep tells IndiaToday.In. \"When I was designing mandirs in homes 10 years back, they used to look like a basic wardrobe kind of thing. They were with lesser design elements and more functional. So it used to be a unit in the corner of a room as per vaastu. Then innovations came into play,\" says Tarandeep. \"Now we do the cutouts and the mantras are written on the back panel of the temple at home. Then there are LED lights that are added to make it look trendy and attractive,” Tarandeep says. It has always been a practice to keep five to 10 idols in the puja spaces. But now, Tarandeep says, in some households, people do not even keep idols. “The deities are printed on acrylic sheets on the back panel of the mandir and are lit from behind using LED lights. So, when you turn on the light, you see the entire figure,” says Tarandeep Kaur, who has been designing homes for almost two decades now. Tarandeep Kaur, a Delhi-based interior designer, says acrylic sheets and LEDs are used in a way that you see the deities when you switch on the lights. Social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook have also influenced people to go for aesthetic puja rooms. People are more aware of the bells and whistles now. \"The shift is that household mandirs have gone from being simple structures to being an important design element. In one of my latest projects, we added small brass bells on the mandir door to make it more beautiful,\" says Tarandeep. This also explains why people are increasingly taking the help of interior designers for puja rooms. The puja corner adds to the overall aesthetic of the house and gives the residents another spot to flaunt. Social media posts and reels are, of course, influencing a lot of that. Ashish Tyagi, Senior Account Delivery Manager with Glorio Group, wanted a bigger pooja room space as he was moving into a larger house. Tyagi says how could he not devote a bigger room to the God whose blessings helped him move to a bigger house? It isn't only about the puja room, even the products used in rituals have been touched by innovation. New products are changing the way we perform our puja rituals. Havan or consecrated fire, for example, used to be an elaborate affair earlier. Now, one can perform havan in cups. People had to arrange several havan samagri (items) for the ancient Vedic ritual that involves burning herbs, resins, and other offerings to purify the environment and promote positivity. Forget the samagri and even the metal vessel. Now, several agarbatti (incense stick) brands, including Cycle, Phool and Hari Drashan, are offering havan cups. These small cups are typically handmade from a variety of materials, including cow dung, recycled temple flowers, dried flower petals, neem, sandalwood, camphor and other herbs. The havan samagri comes in a separate packet. All one needs to do is pour the samagri into the havan cup and light it. Even the ubiquitous cotton wicks in the oil lamps haven't gone untouched by innovation. We pay scant attention to it, but poorly-made wicks, often made with bleached cotton, result in the oil lamp flame dying out in hours. To beat this, Om Bhakti, a platform selling puja materials, has come up with cotton wicks that they claim last for at least 12 hours with minimal usage of oil. “We have developed a cotton wick that can last up to 30 hours and uses less oil too. We have filed a patent request for our cotton wick,\" Sridhar Joshi, co-founder of OM Bhakti, tells IndiaToday.In. During Navaratri, when people light diyas all-day, these cotton wicks do a miracle, says Joshi. \"If lit before sunrise, lamps with this wick will be on at least till sunset. This is particularly helpful during Navaratri, when the diyas (earthen lamps) should be burned throughout the nine days,” says Joshi. Catering to our rushed lives, OM Bhakti also has ghee wicks, which saves puja preparation time. The Om Bhakti Ghee Batti is made from \"pure cow ghee\" and stays in a solid state at room temperature. Then there is also the pancha deepa or deepam oil -- a blend of five natural oils for prayer lamps. Incense sticks are integral to prayer rituals in Hindu households. These incense sticks have also been rolled with innovation now. Millions of metric tons of floral waste is generated across temples of India every year. After being offered to the Gods, these flowers are discarded. Phool collects these flowers and recycles them into incense sticks and cones. The company now sells dhoop and incense sticks made using flowers used in temples in Ayodhya and Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi. So, it isn't just that the puja corner has changed, even everyday products have changed over the years. Puja samagri, a crucial part of India's religious and spiritual landscape, has burgeoned into a market worth approximately $2 billion. Traditionally, puja items were sourced from local artisans and vendors, but the industry has witnessed a seismic shift, driven by urbanisation, globalisation, and the advent of e-commerce. Today, the market for puja samagri spans a vast network of manufacturers, retailers, and online platforms, offering everything from simple diyas (lamps) to elaborately pre-packaged ritual kits. The industry is currently experiencing a phase of innovation and modernisation. Companies are leveraging technology to cater to the evolving needs of a diverse consumer base. E-commerce firms are making puja products available everywhere. “This digital shift has particularly benefited the Indian diaspora, enabling them to maintain cultural and religious practices despite geographical distances. Online platforms not only bridge the geographical gaps but also introduce a younger, tech-savvy generation to traditional practices.” says Sridhar Joshi of OM Bhakti. The puja room, a dedicated space for prayer and rituals which has been a cornerstone of Hindu households for centuries, has evolved. The arrival of innovative products like dawn-to-dusk wicks and havan and dhoop cups and puja kits have changed the way we conduct our puja rituals."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Actor Kamakshi Bhat got a surprise text from her landlord in Mumbai in February that the monthly rent for her 3BHK flat had been hiked to Rs 84,000 from Rs 64,000. Pay up or leave, she was told. Sanchi Mishra, a marketing professional, saw her rent in Bengaluru surge by Rs 20,000 to Rs 65,000 since last year. A 44 per cent increase in just a year forced her to shift from Bengaluru to Gurugram. Eshwar, a media professional in Noida, was under the burden of loans he had taken for a health emergency when his landlord told him that the rent for his flat was being raised by Rs 7,000 to Rs 27,300. He was also forced to pay an additional security deposit. Leaving the comfort of home to pursue opportunities in new cities is what millions of young Indians do every year. It's not just about leaving homes; it's about finding a new one in a new city. But as aspirations soar in ‘New India’, the struggle to find affordable housing in cities like Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Noida, and Gurugram intensifies. Data from property consultancy firm ANAROCK Group sheds light on how, on average, there has been a 4-9 per cent jump in housing rent in just the first three months of 2024. “This is significant because typically, average rentals in a year rise anywhere between 5-10 per cent. Such a growth in just one quarter is indeed significant,” said Santhosh Kumar, Vice-Chairman of ANAROCK Group. This signifies a four-fold surge in house rent within just a year in several cities. “Considering that rents go up annually by 10 per cent, this 30-40 per cent increase is huge. A sudden increase affects the tenants also because there has not been a hike in three years,” said Manju Yagnik, Vice-Chairperson of Nahar Group and Senior Vice-President of NAREDCO- Maharashtra. This is exactly what happened with actor Kamakshi Bhat. The monthly rent for her 3-BHK flat in Mumbai's Versova skyrocketed by 31 per cent. She had been paying Rs 64,000 per month since September 2021, but she was told living there would cost Rs 84,000 per month now. Ayushi Ashar, Ashar Group & Member of the Managing Committee of MCHI-CREDAI, provided some key insights on housing rent trends in some cities like Mumbai, Noida, and Bengaluru. “In Mumbai, for example, the average monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment has surged to Rs 45,000 in the first quarter of 2024, marking a staggering 30 per cent rise from pre-pandemic levels,” she said. “Similarly, Noida and Bengaluru have experienced significant spikes, with average rents hitting Rs 32,000 and Rs 38,000 per month, respectively, reflecting increases of 25 per cent and 22 per cent since 2022,” she added. This has resulted in crushing financial and mental stress for millions of young working professionals living on rent in these cities. IndiaToday.in spoke to tenants in these cities, and their stories paint a grim picture. Once a comforting constant during the pandemic, rents have now morphed into a relentless burden. To many, the dream of affordable housing feels like a cruel joke, leaving them grappling with financial strain and a sense of despair. It's not just the rent, some have been forced to pay higher security deposits too. Kamakshi Bhat, an actor settled in Mumbai, shares a 3-BHK apartment in Versova with a flatmate. They have been paying Rs 64,000 as monthly rent since September 2021. Recounting how the apartment owner caught her off-guard by suddenly demanding a higher rent, Kamakshi said, “In February 2024, we randomly got a text from the owner saying that the rent was now at Rs 84,000. If it doesn't suit you, you may leave after a month of notice.” Kamakshi and her flatmate scrambled to find a solution – searching for a third flatmate to share the rent load while simultaneously hunting for cheaper flats. Their efforts were met with disappointment. “Obviously, we could not look for a new one in just 30 days. We could not get a third person to share, either. Our situation was such that we had to comply,” Kamakshi said. They are now paying Rs 84,000 in rent per month, a hike of 31 per cent. Kamakshi firmly believes the owner's demand was \"not only unethical but also illegal\". The rent-control and tenancy laws stipulate that rents for non-commercial buildings can't be hiked by more than 10 per cent a year (or on lease expiry). However, flat owners circumvent the laws by drawing up new agreements with unusually high rent hikes. Kamakshi went on to explain how the increased rent not only impacted her savings but also caused immense stress, especially because she is an actor without any fixed monthly income. “If you live in Bombay, the rent is always at the back of your mind. Sometimes, I think of taking a break from films and trying out theatre for six months, since theatre doesn't pay well, that paradox keeps going in my mind,” said Kamakshi, revealing her Catch-22 situation. She said it was mentally and physically taxing to always keep budgeting the high rent. Eshwar, a media professional in Noida, echoed Kamakshi Bhat's sentiment. A sudden demand for a higher rent left him feeling financially vulnerable and emotionally drained. That too when he was dealing with a health emergency. \"I have been living in my apartment since 2018. After 2020, the landlord didn't raise the rent until December 2023, when he suddenly increased it from Rs 20,000 to Rs 27,300 per month (including society maintenance),\" he said. While the increased rent was part of the burden, it was the demand for an additional security deposit that stunned him. \"What really messed me up was the request for a fresh deposit of Rs 33,500, bringing the total to Rs 50,000,\" Eshwar said. With just 20 days to decide, the pressure mounted, especially since he was already under the burden of loans he had taken earlier that year due to a health emergency. \"For someone who has been living in his house and regularly paying rent and housing society maintenance all through the six years of tenancy, raising the security deposit really felt disrespectful and inconsiderate,\" he added. Eshwar's story resonates with many grappling with similar dilemmas in the rapidly expanding cities of the National Capital Region (NCR), especially Noida, where housing rents have skyrocketed nearly 100 per cent since 2017, with a sharp 30-40 per cent spike in 2023 alone. Individuals living on rent in Noida and Gurugram, two prominent NCR hubs, faced similar predicaments, compelled to comply with sudden rent and deposit hikes. The rent crisis is forcing people to compromise on the area they want to reside in and the kind of house they would have liked to stay in. Shikhar Mishra, a Gurugram resident, went on an arduous house-hunting journey for over 2 months. He was looking for a fully furnished apartment but was forced to settle for an unfurnished flat due to exorbitant rent demands. “What should have been a 15-20 day flat hunt turned into two months. I got a place in November 2022 but had to compromise. The 2-BHK flat that was in my budget was not furnished. But I had to move in. The kind of furnished flats I was eyeing was quoted at around Rs 50,000-Rs 60,000 and beyond my budget,” Shikhar said. Noida and Gurugram may not be among the four metro cities (as per HRA rules under the Income Tax Act), but house rents in these two cities have surged alongside other non-metro hotspots like Bengaluru, Pune, and Hyderabad. The rent crisis is also hitting professional careers by making people move out of cities they prefer. Sanchi Mishra, a marketing professional, saw her rent in Bengaluru's Whitefield area surge by Rs 20,000 from Rs 45,000 to Rs 65,000 last year. That is a 44 per cent increase in just one year. On top of that, she was shelling out Rs 12,000 in maintenance charges every month. That took her total rent to Rs 77,000 per month. Sanchi Mishra loved her job in Bengaluru, but the skyrocketing rent forced her to shift cities, and she landed in Gurugram. \"In Whitefield, it took me an hour to travel 7 kilometres to reach any central area. The commute was always a mess. Dining was comparatively expensive, or at least I felt so. So were the cleaning services,\" Sanchi tells IndiaToday.In. She is paying Rs 49,000 on house rent in Gurugram now. \"In Gurugram, we are paying Rs 49,000, inclusive of maintenance, in one of the best areas of the city, compared to what Whitefield is,\" adds Sanchi Mishra. India’s Silicon Valley, Bengaluru, which Sanchi Mishra left, has one of the highest average housing rents among tier-1 cities. Avg. Rent for standard 2BHK unit of 1,000 sq. ft. area (INR/month) Cities Micro Markets 2022 2023 Q1 2024 Gurugram Golf Course Road 37,000 41,500 43000 Sohna Road 28,500 32,700 34300 New Gurugram 22,500 25,500 26500 Sohna 16,000 18,000 18900 Bengaluru Sarjapur Rd 24,000 31,600 34000 Whitefield 22,500 30,200 32500 Hyderabad HITECH City 24,600 31,000 32500 Gachibowli 23,400 30,500 32000 MMR Chembur 51,000 60,000 62500 Mulund 41,000 46,500 48200 NCR Sector-150 (Noida) 19,000 22,000 24000 Dwarka 22,000 25,800 27400 “If we compare rentals between 2022-end and Q1 2024, top localities in Bengaluru have seen rentals go up by more than 40 per cent,” ANAROCK Group’s Santhosh Kumar said. It still stands out among the top seven cities with the highest housing rents. Axis Ecorp CEO and Director Aditya Kushwaha said Bengaluru has cemented its status as the country’s “hottest residential market” and acknowledged that rents have nearly doubled since the beginning of 2023. What makes the situation in the city far worse is the demand for inflated deposits. The excessive demand from house owners/brokers in Bengaluru comes at a time when most offices are calling their employees back to work. And the situation has become nightmarish for fresh-out-of-college professionals. Sumit Saurabh, a Bengaluru-based engineer, highlighted that renting a flat is out of reach for most freshers, who do not earn more than Rs 40,000 on average a month. “Renting a flat is quite a difficult task as mostly you would encounter brokers who charge 1-1.5 month rent as brokerage. It’s common practice to pay in advance (deposit), which generally is 4–5 months of rent. So this can easily go to over Rs 1 lakh,” Sumit said. “The only option for young professionals is to live in a PG hostel,” he said. But even PGs are going out of reach in Bengaluru. Richa Singh, a media professional who lives in a PG accommodation in Bengaluru, said her monthly rent shot up by 15 per cent in just six months after moving in. “It is shocking to me,” Richa said, highlighting that the rising rent just adds to the financial burden of living in the city, factoring in the overall high cost of living in Bengaluru. What exactly are the factors behind such drastic house rent spikes in metro and non-metro cities across India? Priyatham Kumar, Founder of Homes247, attributed the sharp rise in rent in non-metro cities like Noida and Bengaluru to a surge in demand for housing units, fuelled primarily by population growth and rising demand. “This surge in demand, coupled with steady borrowing rates, has led to higher housing prices, subsequently impacting rental rates,” added Kumar. The booming real estate market has played a big role in pushing up rents, even in non-metro cities, said Sarveshaa SB, Chairman and Managing Director of BHADRA Group, a leading Bengaluru-based real estate developer. “This is because IT workers are slowly moving back into office areas, and a lot of young people are moving to cities to find work. The problem is that there are not enough rented homes to meet the high demand. There have been a lot fewer new rental units coming on the market, with some sources saying the drop is as big as 16.9 per cent year-on-year,” Sarveshaa SB told IndiaToday.In. “This disparity affects cities like Noida and Bengaluru, which are important to many businesses,” he added. Rapid urbanisation in non-metro cities and ease of living are two factors that have led to a surge in housing rents, Jash Panchamia, partner at Suraksha Group, told IndiaToday.In. Speaking specifically about Noida, he said, “It has been one of the emerging choices for rental spaces owing to the essential infrastructure developments in the city like Jewar airport, development, and connectivity across Yamuna Expressway being part of the UP growth story.” Panchamia feels that the non-metros in India will “continue to see a surge in demand for rented spaces”. Ashar Group’s Ayushi Ashar also attributed the rising house rents across India to higher disposable incomes and a desire for more living space and evolving lifestyles. While this indicates that many with higher incomes are willing to pay more rent for better housing and facilities, a larger number of people are struggling to cope with the ongoing rent crisis. Another reason why tenants are feeling the pinch of higher house rents is directly related to a growing number of luxury projects, which attract high maintenance costs. “Property developers and landlords, in a bid to maintain their profit margins, often transfer the burden of escalating costs of building material and labour expenses to tenants through increased rents,” noted Nahar Group’s Manju Yagnik. She also said property owners were charging higher rents to make up for the surge in property taxes and other associated expenses. Sanchi Mishra was forced to leave Bengaluru and settle in Gurugram because of the exorbitant hike in rent. There are not many places that young professionals can move to and escape the rent turmoil. People in Pune and Hyderabad, too, are grappling with soaring housing costs. “The rental growth in Hyderabad and Pune is because the two are IT/ITeS-centric cities,” explained ANAROCK Group’s Kumar. Shruti Bharuka, an IT engineer settled in Pune, said when she moved to the city last year, brokers in Hinjewadi were quoting Rs 51,000 for a 3-BHK fully furnished apartment. This, along with a deposit of Rs 51,000 and a brokerage fee of Rs 51,000. She could only afford this house because it was on a six-person sharing basis, with the rent coming to Rs 8,500 per head. However, in just a year, the rent increased to Rs 57,000 or Rs 9,500 per head. Shruti had initially tried looking for a 1BHK flat, but backed out due to the high brokerage and security deposits. The situation in Hyderabad is equally alarming, with housing rent rising 25-30 per cent in 2024 in comparison to 2019. There has been an increase even in semi-urban areas, indicating that low-cost renting options are slowly disappearing. Ishan Moitra, a medical researcher who moved to Hyderabad during the second Covid-19 wave in early 2021 said he rented a flat for Rs 13,500 per month in Bachupally. He got the flat at a cheaper price than usual due to the pandemic, but added that rents have gone up as people are no longer working from home and have moved back to the city. The ongoing rent crisis across India is worsening every quarter, with house owners blatantly flouting rules by arbitrarily increasing rents and asking for security deposits exceeding two months. While the growth of India’s property market is good for the country’s economy, the harsh truth is that house owners are piggybacking on this trend to exploit young working professionals living in rented flats. As rent prices soar to new heights, young Indians migrating to new cities in pursuit of their dream find themselves caught in a nightmarish cycle of stress and financial distress. Each rental increase becomes a glaring reminder of the widening gap between ambition and affordability, leaving many with their dreams hanging precariously in the balance."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story When 10-year-old chess prodigy Charvi Anilkumar met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January to receive the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar Award, she made a request to him. \"Please introduce chess in schools\". The Prime Minister promised to look into it. Charvi fell in love with the sport when she was five and has evolved into one of the most promising young talents in the world. However, it also needed a lot of sacrifice. The 10-year-old hasn't watched TV at home in the last five years. Charvi is unique, but she is also part of a trend. Youngsters from India are taking the chess world by storm. Gukesh D created history in Toronto by becoming the youngest player to win The Candidates Chess tournament. But it wasn't just Gukesh. Five young Grandmasters from India, including two women, were at the premium Candidates tournament. Contrast this with 2014. Vishwanathan 'Vishy' Anand was the only Indian Grandmaster in The Candidates. \"The Indian earthquake in Toronto is the culmination of the shifting tectonic plates in the chess world as the 17-year-old Gukesh D will face the Chinese champion Ding Liren for the highest title. The \"children\" of Vishy Anand are on the loose!\" chess legend Garry Kasparov said in his social media post . The post came a day after Gukesh became the youngest-ever world title challenger, breaking Kasparov's 40-year-old record. So, what has changed that we have this sudden burst of chess Grandmasters, young and bubbling, ready to checkmate the best in the world? There are several factors, both domestic and international. Among the most interesting is a number of Indian Grandmasters who are ready to give back to society by creating a line of champions. They have set up schools and are spotting talent and coaching them. Ten-year-old Charvi from Bengaluru is being trained by Grandmaster RB Ramesh. Charvi's parents spotted her talent early, and she started making rapid progress under the guidance of an International Master. She was just 8 years old when she won the Under-10 national tournament in Jammu and the Under-8 Girls World Championship in 2022. Now, Charvi is the only woman Under-11 player with an ELO rating of 1,900 or more and is ranked No. 2 in the Under-11 category. She is also a Woman Candidate Master -- a strong candidate to become a Master. The prodigies are taking Indian chess to a whole new level. So, you have 84 Grandmasters in India now, while there was just one, Vishwanathan 'Vishy' Anand, in 1987. Until 1999, India had only three chess Grandmasters. However, in the last 24 years, there have been 81 Grandmasters emerging from India. In terms of the number of Grandmasters, with 84, India ranks fifth in the world. The numbers are staggering and speak for themselves. There are four Indians in the Top 20 of the FIDE world chess rankings in the open section. In the junior rankings, three of the top five are Indians. They are R Praggnanandhaa, D Gukesh and Nihal Sarin. In the women's section, three of the Top 20 are Indians, including R Vaishali -- Praggnanandhaa's sister. Vishwanathan 'Vishy' Anand was elated in describing the unprecedented success of D Gukesh at The 2024 Candidates. \"It's difficult to add adjectives to a historical performance. The fact that, in one of the strongest tournaments, he [Gukesh] became the youngest world challenger in history,\" Viswanathan Anand told IndiaToday.in. In fact, Gukesh and two others in The Candidates -- Praggnanandhaa and Vaishali -- are from the first batch of Vishwanathan Anand's chess institute -- the Westbridge Anand Chess Academy (WACA). The world-class facility was founded by Vishy in 2020. So, is it actually that any child can be honed into a master chess player? But before we get into that, let's talk about the factors that have all come together to help India surge towards chess dominance. India has produced 81 Grandmasters since 2000 (India Today Graphics) It's tough to pinpoint a particular reason for the assembly line of chess prodigies in the country. The overall improvement in the landscape makes the pre-2000 era feel like a \"different planet\", says GM Ramesh. The internet boom has given budding talents access to better training, software and chess literature. Young players have access to the moves and strategies of legends across the globe. \"MagnusCarlsen, Vishy Anand sir, Mikhail Tal and Judit Polgar,\" are my idols, says Charvi, revealing how the little girl is aware of the Grandmasters from different eras and geographies. The pandemic also helped by giving young minds time to work on their skills and not worry about the rigours of competitions. The collective success is also helping India at the highest level. Like China in the early 2000s, India is riding on reputation and winning half the battle before the game is played. \"When some country is doing very well, it demoralises the others. It's a psychological advantage that Indians have got. I think many are fearing playing against Indians,\" Grandmaster RB Ramesh, who's training Charvi among others, tells IndiaToday.In. Government support over the years has also increased. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the rise in Indian Grandmasters during her Budget speech this year. All India Chess Federation president Nitin Narang told IndiaToday.In that an extensive action plan to ride on the new wave would be announced on May 4, promising meticulous strategies to take the game forward. Also, more private businesses are interested in pumping money into chess now. Anand's Chess Academy WACA, funded by Westbridge Capital -- a capital markets company -- is a good example of how partnerships can help chess grow in India. India is lucky to have an ecosystem in which Grandmasters are taking the lead in moulding the next generation. Grandmaster RB Ramesh and his wife, Women's Grand Master Aarthie Ramaswamy, have been running the Chessgurukul in Chennai since 2008. Praggnanandhaa, who became a Grandmaster at 12, and his sister and Grandmaster, Vaishali, are from there. Young minds at work at RB Ramesh's Chess Gurukul in Chennai (Courtesy: chessgurukul_official/Instagram) World title contender D Gukesh has been trained by Grandmaster Vishnu Prasanna, who runs his academy in Chennai. At a higher level, Viswanathan Anand, inspired by the Botvinik School of Chess, which produced an assembly line of world-beaters from the Soviet Union, is keen on building on the groundwork. Founded in 2020, the Westbridge Anand Chess Academy has a powerful core group of coaches, including Poland's Grzegorz Gajewski, Grandmaster Sandipan Chanda, Russian Grandmaster Artur Yusupov and Belarusian-Israeli Grandmaster Boris Gelfand. \"What we try to do is come in and see what's going well for them. Many of them already have good support teams, like their parents and their coaches, and so on. And then try to see the areas we can fill in,\" Vishwanathan Anand tells IndiaToday.In. \"We will continue to identify great talents and see how to make them top players. That conversion, you can't take it for granted. And I think that's what WACA is going to try and focus on,\" says Anand. It's not fair to ignore the role schools have been playing in developing chess. For instance, the Velammal Vidyalaya in Chennai has been home to 15 out of 29 Grandmasters from Tamil Nadu. State-wise split of Indian Grandmasters (India Today Graphics) Chess originated in India in the form of chaturanga in the 6th Century AD. It reached Persia, where it was named shatranj, and spread to all corners of the world. Being played originally in India, do Indians have some innate talent for the game? Have you ever wondered whether your child is capable of becoming a chess Grandmaster? Or if the likes of Gukesh and Praggnanandhaa are born with some gift? \"I wouldn't make a sweeping statement that Indians are naturally gifted in this or that. But it's clear that culturally, our parents and our culture point us in a certain direction. I am very happy to know that so many Indian parents want their kids to learn chess. It's a wonderful mental activity for them,\" says Vishwanathan Anand, when asked if Indians were born with skills for chess. \"Even if you take this generation that's at the top, they are all 20 and under, and they are constantly looking over their shoulders. They may be one of the best players in the world. But they may not be even the best players in India, or even in their region in India. So, that forces them to be on their toes and this competitive environment is very healthy for chess,\" he tells IndiaToday.In. Anyone can become a Grandmaster, provided he or she is willing to learn, work hard and constantly look to improve, according to Grandmaster Ramesh. However, it is evident that it needs a lot of sacrifice. Remember, Charvi hasn't watched TV at home in the last 5 years. D Gukesh \"sacrificed his childhood\" to become one of the best in the world, says his coach Grandmaster Vishnu Prasanna. \"Gukesh has basically given up his childhood... He does not have anything that a normal kid has. He does not have free time. He has to take more stress than an average child,\" says Prasanna. So, how do the chess institutes really help? \"Most of the children are extremely talented. I feel you need good hardware, and we install software in it. The human brain is the basic requirement to become a Grandmaster,\" Grandmaster Ramesh tells IndiaToday.In. Young minds with big dreams at the Chess Gurukul in Chennai (Courtesy:chessgurukul_official/Instagram) The boom in chess also coincides with the idea of 'New India' in which young Indians are more confident of becoming the best in the world. The landscape is changing across sports. Take Neeraj Chopra for example. Since his historic Gold at the Tokyo Olympics, more and more track and field athletes are shining at the highest level. So, a child in India seeking to be a Grandmaster has a much better chance now than she would have a decade ago. \"The ecosystem develops slowly. We help build on that, and it's a long-drawn process. Many of the people who became Grandmasters are working with youngsters, whom we are working with in WACA. So you can see a clear progression there,\" says Vishwanathan Anand. \"It's speeding up. As Indians get access to more tools and the best sporting methods. You can see India is doing well in sports, not just in chess, but across disciplines. The competitive environment is becoming world-class,\" Anand adds. The attitude in Indian families regarding sports as a career has undergone a sea change too. Families now don't take sporting talent for granted. Charvi's mother, a techie by profession, gave up her job in Bengaluru to devote time to her talented daughter. \"Quitting the job was not an easy decision. We are also from a middle-class background. But she was attending international tournaments, one after the other. It was very difficult for me to manage my work. I quit my job in March 2023 to support her. I have to help her with her studies also,\" Akhila, Charvi's mother, says. So, is it all rosy in the Indian chess landscape? \"From lack of everything, I think it has become too much of everything. It has its own problems,\" says Grandmaster RB Ramesh, explaining that kids are spoilt for choices in terms of the number of tournaments available. \"Chess is also becoming very expensive, especially in training. When I used to be a trainer, I used to charge Rs 200 per hour. But now, nine out of ten who become Grandmasters, become trainers,\" says Grandmaster Ramesh. \"I think some are charging Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,500 per hour when they are starting out as trainers. Some don't even know what it requires to offer the right training. But the Grandmaster title is helping them,\" he adds. Grandmaster Ramesh also points to the pressure this is creating for parents. \"Parents are feeling the pressure. Some of them are thinking, 'my son/daughter has to learn from a Grandmaster because someone else's son is learning from a Grandmaster'.\" While online tournaments and the availability of web applications have spiked the interest in chess, it has its pitfalls, the decorated coach added. \"Too much use of the computer is unhealthy. I think a lot of children play chess only on their PCs. They don't use a physical chess board. You need to form a bond with the chess pieces, and you need to speak to the pieces. You need to read books, understand and try out the moves and then go back. I think self-learning has gone down,\" says Ramesh. Much like the battle on the board, every step toward holistic growth in Indian chess needs to be calculated. There's no dearth of talent and with the right support, India can indeed become the next powerhouse of the sport. There was a moment in the Soviet Union in the 60s when there were four champions -- Mikhail Tal, Mikhail Botvinnik, Tigran Petrosian and Boris Spassky. There were four champions in the same decade. That is unique. \"I don't know if we will manage to replicate that. It's possible that we could have an Indian world champion and an Indian challenger, at some point,\" says Viswanathan Anand, adding to what promises to be an exciting decade for Indian chess. There are multiple factors, including the Covid-time break, Indian Grandmasters grooming fresh talent and government and private push, that has resulted in India seeing a spike in chess prodigies. Children, including your child, have it in them to be groomed into master chess players, but it needs dedication, support, guidance and sacrifice. Because dozens of children, Indian families and coaches are willing to make the sacrifices, India seems to have a bright future in chess in the coming years."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story A small UPI code peeks out of the green coconuts heaped on Yuvraj Yadav's handcart outside a park in Delhi's GK-1. \"I get 90% of my money through it,\" says the 18-year-old, pointing to the printed QR code. This is nothing unusual for Indians now, for they have been witness to a payments' revolution. From paying for tender coconuts to cutting chai, from giving alms to settling the bill at a fine-dining restaurant, people are simply whipping out their phones and using the indigenous United Payments Interface (UPI) platform. The seamless transaction system, however, has fuelled a silent epidemic. The epidemic of overspending. Around 74% of the 276 people surveyed by IIIT Delhi, in what it claims to be the first study on spending behaviour of people using the government's UPI, said they were spending more after adopting the e-payments system. This is interesting because human beings have been trading in currencies for centuries and their spending and saving behaviour has evolved around cash. One might argue that plastic money in the form of credit cards has been there for decades now, but come to think of it, UPI is different from credit cards as no interest is charged. Also, the penetration of UPI is much more than that of credit cards. The mobile-to-bank transfers have done away with the need for a point-of-sale (PoS) machine, which is needed for credit or debit cards. So, on the payment band, UPI is somewhere between cash and credit cards. However, there are two sides to the UPI coin. If some people are spending more, anecdotal evidence suggests there is a segment of people who are now saving money because of UPI. Yuvraj Yadav, who sells tender coconuts in Delhi's GK-1, bears testimony to that. But before we look at his side of the coin, let us find out how and why people believe they are overspending because of UPI. \"Does the convenience of UPI push us to spend more? I feel the tangibility of cash makes us conscious about how much we spend. Paying 5x500 notes in cash is more painful than paying 2500 on UPI. What has been your experience with UPI and spending?\" asked Bengaluru-based Dharmesh Ba on X in 2022. Dozens of people responded to his question and most agreed that they were now spending more because of UPI. Dhruv Kumar, Assistant Professor at IIIT Delhi, and two of his students, Harshal Dev and Raj Gupta, conducted a survey to find out if UPI had indeed changed people's spending habits. They used Google Forms and surveyed 276 individuals aged 18 and above. The participants were from diverse backgrounds, age groups and occupations. \"A significant majority, 74.2% of the respondents, admitted to experiencing increased spending after adopting UPI,\" Dhruv Kumar, Assistant Professor of IIIT Delhi, tells IndiaToday.In. He says the study is pivotal and reveals how India's push for a digital economy is potentially reshaping consumer habits and economic dynamics in the country. The survey found 91.5% of the respondents were satisfied with their overall UPI experience and 95.2% found UPI convenient for making payments. \"Users reported using UPI for essentials like rent, groceries, and bills, as well as for work-related expenses and leisure activities like dining out and entertainment, education, online shopping, and even small everyday indulgences like street food and auto-rickshaw fares,\" says Dhruv Kumar. What is worth noting here is the entire range of UPI transactions -- essential to indulgent and big to small, for which people wouldn't use a credit or a debit card. How the number of UPI transactions has grown per month from April 2023 to April 2024. (Source: NPCI Graphics: Arun Prakash Uniyal/India Today) Launched in 2016, UPI got a big shot in the arm during the Covid pandemic when people began shunning cash. People who have been recording their daily expenses are seeing a jump in their expenditure and credit that to UPI. \"I have been logging my expenses on an Excel sheet since 2018. My expenditure pattern shows that since then, my expenses have increased from 20–25% of my disposable income in 2018 to 60–65% in 2024,\" Nihal Makwana, a Gurugram-based marketing professional, tells IndiaToday.In. We are not talking about overspending because of inflation or consumerism, but due the medium we are choosing for our transactions. \"With cash in hand, it was a constant reminder of how cautious I should be. Earlier, a loaded wallet was a comfort. Now, the wallet is your bank account, and you are always stocked. So, the comfort is never-ending now,\" says the 28-year-old Makwana, who has been running a blog on stock markets since 2021. IIIT Delhi's Kumar emphasised that despite their overall satisfaction with UPI, a significant portion of the respondents in their survey acknowledged the challenges it poses to budget adherence and control over their spending. Obviously, there is ease with UPI. One just needs to scan the merchant or vendor's QR code, type in the amount, punch in the password and tap enter. Payment's done! India sees the highest digital transactions in the world, accounting for nearly 46% of global transactions in 2022, according to the Press Information Bureau. Overspending due to digital transactions, however, is a universal phenomenon. \"Academic research suggests that paying with cash makes people spend more consciously than using digital payments due to its tangible nature, budgeting effect (i.e., helping track expenses), and the psychological pain of giving away cash,\" Jose Manuel Linares-Zegarra, Senior Lecturer in Finance at Essex Business School (UK), tells IndiaToday.In. \"Paying with cash is more painful. Therefore, e-payments could potentially reduce the pain of paying, making it easier to overspend without realising it,\" explains Linares-Zegarra. For centuries, human beings depended on barter for things they didn't produce. The barter system was based on mutual need and desire. Currency, an abstract concept, took out the need for desires to be matched to conduct trade. Now, you can buy a bucket of fried chicken even if the guy at the store doesn't need your shirt. The first use of currency is recorded around 3,000 BC in Babylonian civilisation, where people used chunks of silver for trade. Other civilisations began using precious metals for trade around 1,000 BC. The concept of paper money originated in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD). So, for thousands of years, human beings have been spending and saving money in physical form. Remember the piggy bank? Our lives and behaviours have evolved around physical currency notes. Digital payments, of which UPI has become a major part, is a disruptor. \"People have built budgeting practices around cash. There are also issues of financial literacy and trust. Digital payments are relatively new, and these institutions are in the process of adapting,\" Professor Bernardo Batiz-Lazo of Northumbria University, Newcastle, tells IndiaToday.In. \"Therefore, you see a number of different behaviours between countries and within countries. So as a society is learning about these new forms, you have people at the extremes,\" explains Batiz-Lazo. The value of transactions done through UPI has risen over the months to touch almost Rs 20 lakh crore in April 2024 (Source: NPCI Graphics: Arun Prakash Uniyal/India Today) The shift in digital transactions is also driven by government policies, like the Digital India campaign. \"State authorities expect a reduction in tax avoidance; fintech companies, banks and other financial institutions generate income/benefit when you don't use cash, while they see cash as a 'cost',\" explains Professor Bernardo Batiz-Lazo. He says, in many countries, people prefer cash for small transactions, while large transactions in cash are forbidden by law. \"The size of the informal economy is also an important factor to explain the differences,\" Professor Batiz-Lazo adds. The shift towards digital transactions, as explained by experts, is resulting in some behavioural changes around money. Basudev Chowdhury, who has been running a grocery store in Delhi's CR Park for almost 30 years, is a witness to this changing behaviour. \"Customers are indulging themselves as their purchases aren't constrained by the physical cash they are carrying. I see more people now giving in to their temptations,\" says Chowdhury. He reveals that even shopkeepers are overspending due to UPI. He says they are now overstocking, and losing money because the hoarded products are crossing their sale-by dates. \"The supplier knows that cash isn't an issue as the shopkeeper can pay through UPI. I have been lured with better discounts on bulk purchases, and lost money when the products expired,\" reveals Chowdhury. Basudev Chowdhury, who has been running a grocery shop in Delhi for the last 30 years, reveals that even shopkeepers are overspending due to UPI. The growing popularity of e-payments through UPI in India is evident from data shared by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which manages the retail payments and settlement systems in India. According to NPCI, there were 13.3 billion transactions through UPI worth Rs 19.64 lakh crore in April 2024. The number of UPI transactions saw a 50% growth against April 2023 and the amount transferred rose by 40% year-on-year. However, the transition to digital payments is influencing consumer behaviour in complex ways, says Jose Manuel Linares-Zegarra of Essex Business School (UK). \"For example, digital payments can increase spending, but it is also important to consider that there are several new tools available to consumers to manage their money,\" he adds. A distinction needs to be drawn here between credit cards and digital payment systems linked to savings bank accounts. \"From the consumer point of view, since one is able to check their account balance, they are spending from what they have. So, there is a reality check. Credit cards do allow you to spend what you don't have,\" Professor Gaurav Raina of IIT Madras tells IndiaToday.In. Professor Raina was the chairman of the Mobile Payment Forum of India (MPFI), which played a key role in setting up the technology standards for mobile payments in India, from 2017 to 2021. A huge segment of Indians are actually saving money with UPI and that is because the money is landing in their bank accounts. \"I receive 90% of my payments through UPI, and it helps me save money. I use UPI to pay the wholesaler at Azadpur fruit market and use the cash for my expenses. The rest of the money remains as savings in my bank account,\" says Yuvraj Yadav, the coconut seller in Delhi. Professor Gaurav Raina says that since mobile payments enable customers to pay money directly into the bank, even small transactions add up in accounts, giving people from low-income groups the ability to make day-to-day, and long-term, decisions. \"One of the street vendors in 'UPI – The Untold Story' (www.upistory.com) states that accepting payments through UPI actually helps to pay the monthly rent,\" adds Professor Raina. Anju Devi, a domestic help who lives in Greater Noida mostly requests that people pay her salary by scanning the QR code on her cellphone. She says the money goes directly into her bank account, and only she has access to it. Earlier, her husband, who is an alcoholic, used to snatch the cash from her to feed his addiction. \"Now, he [her husband] has no access to my money and I can use it for my two daughters, and also save some,\" says Anju Devi, who is originally from Bihar. Prime Minister Narendra Modi often talks about the penetration of UPI and the financial inclusion it has brought. In January this year, PM Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron had tea outside Hawa Mahal in Jaipur. Macron was pleasantly surprised when Modi used UPI to pay for the tea and the shopkeeper received confirmation of the transaction instantly. For an inclusive digital economy, the Indian government has kept UPI transactions free and customers aren't charged an interchange fee. Yuvraj Yadav says UPI is a blessing because now he doesn't need to turn away any customers because of lack of change. \"Now, even sales on credit have come down as people seldom say that they don't have the exact change and will pay later,\" says Yadav. Yuvraj Yadav, who sells tender coconuts in Delhi's GK-1 area, says he receives 90% of the payments through UPI. As the money is transferred to his bank account, and he is handling less cash, he is saving money, says the 18-year-old. PM Modi has lauded street vendors for adopting Digital India , calling them the \"face of India's digital revolution\". For street vendors, UPI is a must-have, says Professor Raina of IIT Madras. \"From a rural–urban divide perspective, there are still people in cities who might choose not to have UPI, but it is a matter of keeping the business alive for street vendors. So, it is not just good to have. It has almost become a must-have,\" says Raina. So, UPI might be making some people overspend because digital payments take away the pain associated with counting and paying in cash, but it is definitely helping people in the lower income bracket run their businesses better and save some money too."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story \"Do you know anything about cricket?,\" asked an American YouTuber to three other Americans in a video. \"People would say it's kinda similar to baseball, but it really isn't. Besides hitting the ball with the bat,\" replied one in the group. Videos like this are common on YouTube, where Americans learn and react to cricket, a game that is alien to them. Just imagine, the pitch for the India-Pakistan T20 World Cup match to be played on June 9 in the United States was shipped from Australia. It was then transported by road to New York from Florida in a convoy of more than 20 trucks. This is exactly how alien the US is to cricket. How are drop-in pitches installed in a cricket field? Watch the latest video of Nassau County Stadium, NY, which will host the T20 World Cup 2024 and IND vs. PAK. pic.twitter.com/EuGAqzuEy7 — Baljeet Singh (@ImTheBaljeet) May 6, 2024 The pitch, however, has got higher as the baseball-crazy United States is preparing to co-host the T20 Cricket World Cup . While cricket needs no introduction to the huge population of expats from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the multimillion-dollar question is how are the non-Asian Americans taking to the sport that was played in the country as early as the 1700s? Cricket is still barely understood by most non-Asian Americans. However, it has surprisingly taken hold in a country where every child dreams of being the next Babe Ruth, the greatest baseball player in the history of the sport. With the Men's T20 World Cup to be held in the United States, the International Cricket Council (ICC) remains optimistic of cricket hitting a home run in the vastly competitive American sporting landscape. The added incentive being that the US's own cricket team will contest their maiden T20 World Cup by virtue of being the co-host with West Indies. Neighbouring Canada, where the game was popularised by South Asian immigrants, has also qualified for the World Cup in June. USA cricket vice-captain Aaron Jones talks to a tourist in Miami (Image: AFP) Naseem Akhtar, a professor at Arizona State University, Phoenix, said Americans were mostly interested in contact sports like rugby. \"Cricket in the US is catching up, but only among the immigrants from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and some from Nepal,\" Akhtar, who follows cricket closely, tells IndiaToday.in. Akhtar, who hails from Uttar Pradesh's Meerut, the sports goods capital of India, says while there is a good presence of amateur and local cricket clubs in the US, they are mostly concentrated in urban centres like Houston, Boston, New York, Los Angeles, Phoenix and a few in Florida due to its proximity to the Caribbean. The good part is that the game has begun and the conversation around cricket has started in the US. Americans are trying to interpret and understand cricket the baseball way. That is why we find a lot of reaction videos on cricket-baseball on YouTube. Most local club-level matches are played on open grounds rather than in stadiums in the US. (Image: AFP) Though local clubs are mushrooming, infrastructure comes in as a googly. The local cricket clubs arrange their games in multipurpose stadiums used for rugby or baseball. On several occasions, cricketers have to share the field with baseball players, especially during matches with a tape ball, which is even more popular in the US. That these matches are played on open grounds rather than in stadiums has helped pique the interest of locals. \"Sometimes the baseball players come up to us with intrigue as we discuss the game. They show some interest, and most of them are like, 'Oh, this is similar to baseball, yet different',\" said Saif Ahmad, an Arizona-based professional cricketer. Lauderhill in Florida is the only dedicated cricket stadium in the United States. Other than the New York ground where a pitch is being assembled, a baseball ground in Dallas's Grand Prairie is being readied for the T20 World Cup. The local cricket clubs arrange their games in multipurpose stadiums used for rugby or baseball. (Image: Saif Ahmad) It is the same converted baseball stadium on the outskirts of Dallas that got a section of Americans hooked on to cricket when Major League Cricket (MLC), USA's own IPL, made its debut last year. \"The MLC, which had a successful inaugural season in 2023, triggered an interest among the locals. The capitalist Americans saw the engagement and profit in the game through the home-grown MLC. The Americans therefore are likely to increasingly invest in American cricket which, in turn, will inspire lots of youngsters,\" Akhtar said. Backed by big names like Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Adobe's Shantanu Narayen, the first MLC season saw an average stadium capacity of 80%, raking in $2.8 million in ticket sales. In a baseball-crazy nation, around 70,000 spectators turned up to watch top T20 stars like Nicholas Pooran, Trent Boult, Rashid Khan and Faf du Plessis play the \"other\" bat-and-ball game. In fact, the MLC organisers are looking at ways to \"Americanise\" cricket. One of the best ways is to promote it as baseball's distant cousin and highlight similarities like the ball going into the stands as the cricket version of a home run. Moreover, baseball fans are used to keeping those balls. In cricket, the spectators have to return them as the same ball has to be used for the whole innings. \"One day, I would love for fans to keep the balls,\" tournament director Justin Geale said in an interview with AP. The popularity of the Major Cricket League and the mushrooming of smaller tournaments -- like the Arizona Cricket League and the T20 Winter League -- have also ensured the availability of high-grade cricket equipment like bats, balls, and other gear in the US. Unlike a decade ago when cricket enthusiasts had to request their south Asian relatives to get good grade English willow bats from the subcontinent, top brands from India like SG and SS and CA and Malik from Pakistan have their own distributors in the US. \"There are dedicated cricket shops in cities like New Jersey, California, Dallas, and Houston that provide a whole array of cricketing equipment in the US,\" says Saif Ahmad, the captain of Phoenix's Gladiators Cricket Club. Paras Anand, CEO of SG, which sponsors top players like Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul, said exports of cricket equipment to the US have tripled after the Covid-19 pandemic. \"Our sales have gone up in the US in the last few years, but the base is still small. The market size is a lot less than in countries like the UK and Australia,\" Anand tells IndiaToday.in. In fact, the US was the third-largest importer of cricket gear in the world in 2023, with 8,421 shipments, according to data. Seeing the growing trend, SG has plans to set up its own office in the US and Canada later this year. Not just the availability of cricket gear, but the mushrooming of academies too show the rising popularity of the sport in the US. \"Over the past few years, a lot of cricketers have migrated and a lot of academies have also started in the US. With the introduction of the Major League, there has definitely been a trend towards growth,\" SG CEO Paras Anand tells IndiaToday.In. The picture, however, isn't very rosy. The interest among Americans in the T20 World Cup extravaganza remains low, according to a survey by YouGov. The poll found that just one in five Americans expressed interest in the T20 World Cup. On top of that, 46% of those interested in the June event were unaware that some of the matches would be played in the United States itself. The International Cricket Council (ICC) seems to be well aware of the pitch conditions in the US for cricket, considered a religion in India. For the past six months, the ICC has organised a series of introductory events and activities to educate American youngsters on the rules and gameplay of cricket, using baseball. The Empire State Building was illuminated in the colours of the 2024 Cricket World Cup. (Image: X/@T20WorldCup) To pique the curiosity among Americans, the iconic Empire State Building in New York was lit up in the vibrant colours of the 2024 T20 World Cup logo. While cricket won't gain millions of followers in the US overnight, the familiarisation and popularisation process has already begun. The possibilities are endless as the world's biggest sports market hosts the second-most popular sport in just a few weeks. Perhaps a time will come when, along with dreaming of being the next Babe Ruth, children in the US will also aspire to be the next Sachin Tendulkar or Shane Warne. All these with a little hand-holding from baseball."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Jaddanbai, in her ornate, flowing Anarkali dress, sat on a thick carpet in her kotha in Allahabad. The lavish lamps around her flickered and the musicians started slowly. Then a thumri in the honeyed mellowness of her voice enveloped everything. Jaddanbai's craft wove such magic that one of the listeners, a Hindu youth who had plans to go to London, proposed her marriage. That Jaddanbai was a Muslim wasn't the only problem, she was a tawaif too. But none of that mattered to the youth. He converted to Islam, married her and stayed back. London lost to a kotha in Allahabad. This was at the dawn of the 20th Century. Tawaifs (courtesans) had lost much of their former glory and splendour, but their kothas still echoed with music. The Victorian prudishness of the Britishers hadn't yet managed to completely destroy the halls of culture. Jaddanbai, born in a kotha to a tawaif in 1892, would go on to create history as the first woman music composer and film producer in the Hindi film industry. She would also go on to gift the Hindi film industry her daughter -- Nargis -- one of the finest actresses ever. The story of three generations of Jaddanbai's family somehow encapsulate the heydays and the degradation of the tawaif (courtesan) culture. Portraits of Jaddanbai (L) and Bollywood actor Nargis (R). (Image: WomenOnRecord/IndiaTodayArchives) Tawaifs were once considered masters of music and dance, and their kothas were centres for learning adab and tehzeeb for young princes and nobles. But the decline of the Mughals and the regional kingdoms of Bengal, Punjab and Awadh, was when the sun began setting on the kothas. The Britishers frowned upon the cultured tawaifs and dismissed them as 'nautch' girls. The deracinated Indians were so pliable that they saw just debauchery in the kothas. Then the reformist movement in Punjab dealt a body blow. It was popular culture that destroyed whatever remained. Hindi films turned kothas into brothels and tawaifs into plain sex workers. This couldn't be further from the truth. Like the geisha tradition in Japan, tawaifs professionally entertained their guests with shairi and ghazals. Sex was often incidental and wasn't obligatory, say experts. Most of the popular tawaifs often picked and chose from the best of their suitors. However, with time, the culture of tawaifs was lost, and bereft of music, their quarters turned into taboo zones of flesh trade. The rugs wore out and no Jaddanbai sang. A kotha in Lucknow's Kaiser Bagh, used to the sound of ghungroos, woke up one day to the sound of the boots of British soldiers. It was 1857, and the British had crushed the First War of Independence, which started from the barracks of the Company. Now, they wanted the spoils of the war. Gold and silver ornaments studded with precious stones, embroidered cashmere wool and brocade shawls, bejewelled caps and shoes, silver cutlery and jade goblets were among the long list of items recovered by the British from one of the \"female apartments\" of Lucknow's Kaiser Bagh. William Howard Russell, the London Times correspondent, watching British soldiers looting Lucknow's Kaiser Bagh, after it was captured. (Image: London Printing and Publishing Company) The kotha had hosted the consorts of Lucknow's last Nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, and the precious items looted by the Britishers were valued at around Rs 40 lakh, writes author and academic Veena Talwar Oldenburg in her paper, Lifestyle as resistance: The case of the Courtesans of Lucknow, India. At today's value, the loot would have been at least a few thousand crores. That was how affluent tawaifs were. The British were out to loot India's wealth, but another reason why kothas particularly became their target was because rebel sepoys used the apartments as meeting places and hideouts. With the British siege of Lucknow, the tawaifs and their kothas saw their glory fade away. It wasn't just Lucknow, the story was the same in other urban centres like Dilli, Agra and Lahore, at different times. Without wealthy patrons, the kothas, once vibrant centres of music and dance, slowly fell into disrepute. What remains of the laal bazaars (red-light districts) of the subcontinent today is a testimony to this tragic decline and another 'gift' of the British Raj to the subcontinent. The term, 'tawaif', is derived from the Urdu word 'tawaf', meaning circling around (referring to their dance moves). It was once associated with polished and sophisticated dancers and singers, but later started to be conflated with prostitution, often acting as its many synonyms, often as slang. Their stories of grandeur and culture, not much documented, were erased from the collective consciousness forever. Whatever remained of it, was destroyed by a bunch of filmmakers. Jaddanbai, a tawaif who went on to become the first woman composer and film producer in Hindi cinema, was herself born to a tawaif. It is the thumris of her mother Daleepabai that nurtured her first. Widowed at a tender age and thrown out of her marital home, Daleepabai was on her way to end her life when she was kidnapped. She landed at a kotha in Allahabad and went on to rebuild her life. In the kotha and as a tawaif, she had control over her life. \"Tawaif is one word. They were also called Baijis. Tawaif literally translates as courtesans. The aspect of courtesans existed in the Indian culture way before the Mughals,\" Manjari Chaturvedi, dancer and founder of The Courtesan Project, tells IndiaToday.In. In India, throughout ancient times, various kingdoms, irrespective of their religious affiliations, engaged courtesans, who were dancers, singers, and entertainers. Then there were the Devadasis, who served men. \"We have plenty of examples of India's glorious past. The celebrated Nagarvadhu Amrapali, who later became a Buddhist bhikshu, won the title of Rajnartaki (court dancer) of the Republic of Vaishali,\" says Manjari Chaturvedi. And yes, the culture of courtesans isn't unique to India. \"Almost every country in the world that has had a king, a court, a capital and a kingdom, has had courtesans,\" author and scholar Veena Talwar Oldenburg tells IndiaToday.In. With music, dance and literature receiving abundant royal patronage at the peak of the Mughal rule, the tawaifs came to occupy a central part in the courts. The prosperous offshoots of the Mughal empire -- Awadh, Punjab, Bengal and Hyderabad -- inherited the kotha culture and patronised it. Receiving royal support, the tawaifs were educated, socially and economically independent, and in control of their lives. \"They were in the highest tax bracket, with the largest individual incomes of any in the city [Lucknow]. The courtesans' names were also on lists of property (houses, orchards, manufacturing and retail establishments for food and luxury items),\" notes author Veena Talwar Oldenburg in her research paper. The gems of the courts, the courtesans, also had a considerable sway over the affairs of the state and the political developments around them. Novelist and journalist Abdul Halim Sharar, based on the oral testimony of the survivors of the Revolt of 1857 in Lucknow, gives a sneak into court politics and the role of tawaifs, notes author Veena Talwar Oldenburg. \"Hakim Mahdi, who later became Vazir [prime minister of Awadh], owed his initial success to a courtesan named Piyaro, who advanced her own money to enable him to make an offering to the ruler on his first appointment as Governor of Awadh. These absurdities went so far that it is said that until a person had association with courtesans he was not a polished man,\" wrote Abdul Halim Sharar. Like Jaddanbai, other tawaifs also have many firsts attached to their names. Husna Bai, opened the door of Hindustani classical music for women of Awadh. \"In terms of innovation, the tawaifs spawned their own gharanas [school/tradition] within the framework of the traditional and historical gharana in which they were trained,\" notes Thumri singer Kumud Dewan Jha. Mah Laqa Bai, a tawaif, poet and philanthropist from Hyderabad became the first female Urdu poet to have her own collection of poems -- Gulzar-e-Mahlaqa -- which was published posthumously in 1824. Many tawaifs even employed male musicians, music and dance teachers, and even pimps to bring in business to her mehfils after sundowners, according to historian Rana Safvi. Placed higher up in the hierarchy, tawaifs also played a massive role in India's freedom struggle. \"When the mutiny began and spread as a rebellion in 1857, from the cantonments of the country, the tawaifs played a crucial part,\" Veena Talwar Oldenberg tells IndiaToday.In \"They did not directly join the sepoys, like Heeramandi portrays, but their salons and kothas became safe houses for the rebels. They played a very, very critical role in sustaining the British advances for 14 long months before Lucknow was sieged,\" adds Oldenberg, the New York-based author. A painting of the Siege of Lucknow, 1857. (Image: Thomas Jones Barker, 1859) A group of tawaifs of Banaras joined hands with Mahatma Gandhi during the Non-Cooperation Movement of 1920. Inspired by Gandhi's speech, Vidyadhari Bai, a tawaif, began performing nationalist songs in mehfils, and embraced khadi (Indian hand-spun fabric). Tawaifs also played the role of educators for a few. They imparted lessons to young princes and nobles in etiquette, poetry, classical music, and dance. Ironically, the tawaifs we look down upon now were imparting lessons in poetry and etiquette at a time when most ordinary women were unlettered. \"They were probably the only educated women at that time. They were the teachers to many of their kids, and would impart knowledge to the adolescent boys of the elites, as their mothers were uneducated,\" Veena Oldenburg tells IndiaToday.In. Their salons were hubs of intellectual and artistic refinement, where the aristocrats of the area came together. \"Every evening, there would be gatherings where tawaifs would perform. The format was, the lead dancer, the most accomplished, well-trained and most beautiful dancer of the kotha, accompanied by a set of subsidiary dancers who were trainees. They had some great folk and classical music, often based on mythological events,\" says Veena Talwar Oldenburg. The courtesan culture went well with the pre-existing sociopolitical set of the Subcontinent, until the British came in. The charm and status of the tawaifs nosedived as the British firmed their grip. The lustre faded further after the British crown took over control of India from the East India Company in 1858. The British crushed the rajas, maharajas, nawabs and the elites to cement their rule further, and the tawaifs became one of the victims. A sharp and abrupt dip in the royal and aristocratic patronages proved to be fatal as the British eliminated kingdom after kingdom. The British colonisation of India led to the confiscation of the properties of the tawaifs, who they called 'nautch girls'. The word 'nautch' was an English corruption of 'nach', the Hindi word for dance. The ignorant Britishers could not look beyond the dance component of the otherwise majestic institution. Meanwhile, the rise of the social purity movement and the Christian evangelicalism in Great Britain led to an anti-nautch movement in India, where the British worked for the eradication of the tawaifs, which they had no regard for. The tawaifs were reduced to dancing for the sole purpose of titillation. The art forms, passed on from one generation to another, were lost without practice. \"The British first encouraged the tawaifs with taxes during the Company's rule, but destroyed them by restricting them after the Crown takeover. They said, it's nothing but prostitution,\" Veena Talwar Oldenburg tells IndiaToday.In. They even forced the most attractive tawaifs into British garrisons. \"The British, who earlier allowed only single men to serve in India, realised their soldiers needed women in the barracks. They established laal bazaars (red-light districts) in the 110 cantonment districts of India,\" adds author Veena Talwar Oldenburg. The Contagious Diseases Act of 1864 mandated the registration and periodic medical examinations of sex workers in all cantonment cities of the Raj. \"The imposition of the contagious diseases regulations and heavy fines and penalties on the courtesans for their role in the rebellion signalled the gradual debasement of an esteemed cultural institution into common prostitution\" wrote Veena Oldenburg in her research paper. The burden of sexually-transmitted diseases like syphilis further prompted the British to crack down on tawaifs and their kothas. A call for the abolition of \"natch\" was first given in Madras in the early 1890s. The British government also issued an official decree whereby all \"nautch girls\" were branded \"prostitutes\". \"The British made no distinction between an accomplished professional nautch girl or a devadasi and a common prostitute. The educated Indians, suffering from an inferiority complex, were overcome with a sense of shame about their traditional arts,\" notes historian Pran Neville in Nautch Girls of the Raj (2009). \"The British subjugated Indian minds too. This mindset created a widespread disdain for the local culture and trad­itions,\" Neville notes. The term \"tawaif\" accumulated moralistic connotations during British rule, forcing the women employed as courtesans into silence and self-apology. Colonial morals accompanied even after India became Independent. By the end of the 19th Century, \"tawaif\" had become an impolite word, equated to a whore or prostitute in the popular mindset, which continues to this day. \"What the British destroyed, we trampled on its remains after Independence and got rid of it. The only place it flourishes now is Bollywood cinema, not in real life,\" Veena Talwar Oldenburg tells IndiaToday.In. By the 1970s, even the remnants of the kotha culture were wiped off from India. As kothas got uprooted, post-Independence, some of the talent found a new home in Bombay, and the tawaifs cradled the fledgling film industry. \"After India gained Independence, the preformative aspect of the kotha and the tawaifs were transferred to the Hindi cinema,\" Manjari Chaturvedi tells IndiaToday.In. Trained in classical performance arts, tawaifs were among the first actors, playback singers, choreographers, producers, directors, and music directors in Hindi films . Rekha in Umrao Jaan (1981) and Meena Kumari in Pakeezah (1972) played the role of tawaifs in Hindi cinema. The depictions of tawaifs started off well with Umrao Jaan and Pakeezah, but soon the Hindi film industry started stereotyping them as seductive dancers and sex workers. \"Umrao Jaan was authentic as it was based on a novel by Mirza Hadi Ruswa. The director, Muzaffar Ali, spoke to 30 tawaifs in Chowk in Lucknow. As for Pakeezah, it was made in 15 years,\" says Manjari Chaturvedi of The Courtesan Project. \"In the films, whenever they wanted a titillating dance, or they wanted something like an item number, they brought in a tawaif. If they wanted a negative character, they introduced the character of a tawaif. If they wanted to show a hero with a broken heart, he would go to a tawaif. All these ended up stereotyping the image of a tawaif,\" Chaturvedi says. Experts have the same grouse against Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Heeramandi, which is streaming on Netflix. \"I was appalled to see how the tawaif who wants to learn poetry, her books and diary are burnt, and she was discouraged from it and is told that you are only to have sex. What is this? Tawaifs were the most well-read women of their times,\" says Chaturvedi. Ironically, it is the same industry that courtesans like Jaddanbai helped build, which has failed them. Wronged by history, even the memory of the well-read and talented tawaifs hasn't gone unblemished."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Nothing, absolutely nothing, could get the white T-shirt off Rahul Gandhi. From biting cold to requests from alliance partners, the Congress leader has shrugged off everything as he keeps hugging his 'white T-shirt and cargo pants' look for over 18 months now. It began with the Bharat Jodo Yatra in September 2022. The march ended but the smart-casual look continued. The white T-shirt is just about there, finely balanced on the border of semi-formal, and collared to get him an entry to the Gymkhana Club. It is at the bottom end of the aspiration spectrum, and at the top end of accessibility. The look might be semi-casual, but the choice of clothes can’t be a casual afterthought for politicians. “Leaders are often made by their clothes. First things get communicated to the public through their clothes, even before they have started talking,” Dilip Cherian, image guru and veteran public relations (PR) expert, tells IndiaToday.In. “Leaders, starting from Alexander the Great, have used clothes for symbolism,” he says. So, what is the signal that Rahul Gandhi, the leader of a party struggling to offer an alternative to the BJP’s nationalism, welfare and Hindutva politics, is trying to send out with his white T-shirt? What is the single image that he is trying to project, and with whom is he trying to connect? Is anyone, in particular, behind this Rahul brand-building exercise? And, how difficult is it to maintain a white T-shirt amid the swirl of dust on the campaign trail? Well, the choice of clothes for national-level politicians isn’t simple. “There is no dress code in Indian politics. Clothes are a tricky choice given that there is no set format. The choice of clothes of politicians differs on regional lines,” author-commentator Rasheed Kidwai tells IndiaToday.In. State politicians can use regional attire to connect, but how does a national politician connect? They have two choices. Either go the Prime Minister Narendra Modi way and include region-specific pieces of clothing, depending on where you are, or sport a uniform look, signifying unity in diversity, like Rahul Gandhi is doing. The T-shirt might be new, but white is something that the Nehru-Gandhi family has been sticking with for generations. Be it dhoti-kurta or kurta-pyjama, the colour of choice has always been white for Indian politicians. The starch white is a marker for netas -- it helps them stand out in the crowd. “Politicians fancy themselves as people who are clean and puritan, and have a ring of spirituality. White is associated with all those adjectives,” says Rasheed Kidwai. The white of Indian politics owes its origins to Mahatma Gandhi’s khadi movement of 1918. As khadi was handspun, it was easier to have monocoloured clothes than multicoloured weaves. White became the convenient choice. The Nehru-Gandhis continued with the white tradition that began before Independence. “Nehru stuck to the achkan and kurta or white sherwani though they come in various colours. He had a preference for white. Sanjay Gandhi, too, wore all white. He popularised the Kolhapuri chappal and used to throw a shawl over his white kurtas in winters,” says Rasheed Kidwai, who has authored multiple books on the Congress. Sanjay Gandhi (centre) with mother Indira Gandhi. (Photo: India Today Archives) Even Indira Gandhi, says Kidwai, mostly wore handloom sarees. “She was never flashy and preferred earthy colours. She had a very good collection of sarees.” Her son, Rajiv Gandhi, an Air India pilot before he was para-dropped into politics after his brother Sanjay's death, experimented with his dresses. He started wearing business suits after he became the PM. “It was Rajiv and Sanjay who popularised the white kurta and jeans look,” says Kidwai, adding “Rajiv and Sanjay crafted that Marlboro Man image”. The T-shirt-cargo-loafers look that Rahul Gandhi has cultivated for over a year now also has strands of DNA from his father Rajiv. “Loafers were introduced into Indian politics by Rajiv Gandhi. That’s the legacy of his father that he has adopted. Earlier, sports shoes weren’t accepted in Indian politics. Rajiv brought that in. Rahul is a man of taste like his father,” adds Kidwai. The T-shirt look is intended to connect specifically with the youth, be it rural or urban, says Dilip Cherian, image guru and veteran PR expert. “He recognises that the Congress has lost the youth connect and has been branded a mamma-papa party. He is making a conscious effort to reach out to the youth,” Cherian tells IndiaToday.In. One look into a train compartment today would reveal how jeans and t-shirts have become a uniform for the youth across India. It is that youth Rahul is trying to connect with. A man takes a selfie with Rahul Gandhi inside Delhi Metro. Rahul has been targeted as a dynast living in an ivory tower who is far removed from the travails of daily life. The common man’s clothes might be his shot at unshackling himself from that image that critics have spun around him. With the new look, Rahul is trying to project a “youthful, business-like, casual and no-frills attached and a hands-on leader” image, says Rasheed Kidwai. “He is projecting that he is one of the common people and someone who is very approachable.” “Also, it is a busy look. It gives the impression that either he has done something or is in the process of doing something, and isn't holidaying,” adds the author and political commentator. Rahul has also been accused of frequent holiday sojourns. Though mostly seen in darker shades of trousers now, earlier in the Bharat Jodo Yatra, Rahul wore khaki pants, which also complimented his white T-shirts very well. The trousers from the athleisure section seem perfect for work, travel and a cuppa at a high-end club. The comfort-fit cotton trousers also allowed Rahul the occasional sprint and cricket during the yatra. If a blue pair of sneakers were the Bharat Jodo yatri's choice, they have now been traded off for loafers and Peshawari sandals. Rahul, himself, has been dismissive of questions about his sartorial choices. “I just don’t care much about clothes. I just prefer it simple,” he said when asked about his white T-shirts. Though a wave of minimalism with black and white as the predominant colours is sweeping the fashion scene, Rahul Gandhi’s choice of his attire and his sticking to it might not be as simple as he projects it to be. At an INDIA bloc rally, he was requested by a senior leader of an alliance partner to switch to a more formal kurta or shirt while he was sharing the stage, according to sources. Rahul sweetly but sternly turned down the request to ditch his T-shirt, according to the person who requested anonymity. Come hail or high water. Rahul Gandhi delivers a speech in pouring rain while in Mysuru, Karnataka, in his white T-shirt on November 9, 2022. (Image: PTI) That it is more than a simple sartorial choice for comfort and to connect, is revealed by Congress politicians. “In his own words, Rahul Gandhi has said he likes the white T-shirt because of its simplicity and transparency,” Manickam Tagore, Congress MP and former leader of the party's students’ wing NSUI, tells IndiaToday.In. Manickam Tagore alludes to Mahatma Gandhi and his transformation from a suit-wearing advocate to a white dhoti-clad leader to put Rahul Gandhi’s choice of dress in context. “Mahatma Gandhi changed to the clothes that most Indians of that time wore. Rahul Gandhi switched to T-shirts in Bharat Jodo Yatra for the same,” says Tagore. That there is a poverty angle to the T-shirt story was revealed by Rahul himself. During the Yatra last year, Rahul said three poor girls came to him in Madhya Pradesh. They were shivering in the January morning cold. “On that day, I took a decision that till the time I do not shiver, I will only wear a T-shirt,” Rahul told journalists curious to know why he was wearing just a T-shirt in the biting cold. “I want to give a message to those three girls that if you are feeling cold, then Rahul Gandhi will also feel cold,” he added. As if to show his resolve, Rahul Gandhi actually wore just a T-shirt as he walked over 4,000 kilometres across 13 states in 136 days for his Bharat Jodo Yatra in the winter months. Only on the concluding day of the yatra did he throw over a grey Kashmiri pheran in the bone-chilling cold of Srinagar . It was sub-zero temperatures and snowing. The diversity of India is usually described with ‘kos, kos par badle pani, char kos par vani’ . Dialects change with every mile, so do clothes. That Rahul Gandhi, from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, wore a white T-shirt might also be a thread to the unifying factor in that diversity. For, it is the white of the Tricolour that binds the saffron and the green together. “The labourers and youths across India are dressed in T-shirts and trousers. I think Rahul Gandhi’s choice of dress is connecting well with the working-class people,” Manickam Tagore tells IndiaToday.In. Rahul Gandhi has been campaigning for the Congress for the 2024 Lok Sabha election in his white T-shirt and cargo pants. (Image: PTI) Veteran PR expert Dilip Cherian says that Rahul Gandhi likes to present himself as a person listening to people and translating it to aspirations. “He has a bottoms-up approach and is engaged in crowdsourcing kind of leadership,” he adds. But does a Rs 41,000 Burberry T-shirt, for which he was criticised , serve this purpose? “Burberry isn’t a constant, the white T-shirt is,” says Dilip Cherian. The cheques of Burberry are no longer visible. But how does Rahul Gandhi maintain the 'safedi ki chamkar' of his T-shirt given he is constantly on the ground? It’s not a big deal, says Manickam Tagore, Congress's Lok Sabha MP from Virudhunagar, Tamil Nadu, who is usually dressed in a white shirt and dhoti. Tagore travelled with Rahul Gandhi through Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan during the Bharat Jodo and the Nyay Yatra. And is Rahul’s sartorial choice rubbing off on younger Congress leaders? “He has never asked for it to be followed. But yes, a change in dress will likely come,” says Tagore, who has seen generations of young leaders grow from the NSUI nursery. That people noticed Rahul's choice of clothes was evident from the fact that scores of people turned up at his Bharat Jodo Yatra in white T-shirts and trousers. They were not just matching steps, but even fashion. Rahul’s uniform style of dressing is in sharp contrast to PM Modi’s, who tries to speak in local dialects and wear regional outfits . “Modi changes his clothes three times a day. As a kid, I used to go to a fancy party once a year, for Modi, every day is fancy-party day,” says Congress MP Manickam Tagore sarcastically, with a laugh. The unique kurta and jacket, christened after him , helped Modi create a brand image that stood out. Though he ditched the kurta and jacket after becoming Prime Minister, the 'Modi kurtas' and 'Modi jackets' still sell like hot cakes. AAP Convenor Arvind Kejriwal and BJD leader VK Pandian, both former bureaucrats, wear un-tucked shirts to assert the distinction of not being regular politicians, and not belonging to the political establishment. Women politicians too, from Jayalalithaa to Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati, have consciously used their sartorial choices and elements of fashion to craft their exclusive image. Mamata, who fought her way up, uses simple white sarees and rubber slippers to give a daughter-of-the-soil feel. The saree-slipper combo has helped the Trinamool chief project an iron image of an aggressive street-fighter, forever ready to fight and court arrest. Mamata Banerjee has stuck to her simple white saree and rubber slippers look since her activism days. (Photo: India Today) A sharply contrasting image of exclusivity was carved by Jayalalithaa, an actor-turned-politician and resident of the posh Poes Garden. Amma (mother) to her followers, the actor brought with her a sophistication and poise to politics. Her capes, which she matched with every saree, helped provide a royal touch to her elegant persona. For Mayawati, the fashion accessory that has gone to complete her image is the handbag. Forever companions of the BSP supremo, even her statues feature handbags. A fashion statement by high-society women for much of its history, Mayawati has turned handbags into objects of Dalit assertion. Statues of BSP leaders Mayawati and Kanshi Ram. Notice the handbag that Mayawati turned into an article of Dalit assertion. That Rahul Gandhi is using white T-shirt, usually paired with a pair of dark cargo pants, to create an image and connect with the youth and the working class is understood. But who is Rahul’s fashion advisor? Image guru Dilip Cherian, who is said to be close to the Congress ecosystem, says “Rahul Gandhi is doing this by instinct.” Political commentator Rasheed Kidwai, who knows the party and its people inside out, is also of the same opinion. “No one can tell Rahul to do something. He has been following fashion closely and both Priyanka and Rahul are close to fashion designer and couturier Manish Malhotra,” says Kidwai, adding, “One must realise that the Gandhis have a life beyond politics.” The Congress expert also points out how the Gandhis are not flamboyant but of high taste. That is actually reflected in their sense of fashion, which is minimalist but eye-catching. The T-shirt look is also to show that Rahul Gandhi, someone who, by his own admission, is born into the system, is somewhat detached from power. The T-shirt look also blends with Rahul’s unconventional style of politics of freewheeling and not sticking to a specific agenda. His sartorial choice is also an intelligent one. “It sits on the bottom end of aspirational and the top end of accessible,” according to Dilip Cherian. But what has Rahul achieved with this uniform look? “The white T-shirt paired with blue jeans or cargo pants is a form of signalling, it's a short form for Rahul Gandhi now,” says Cherian. “People find comfort in the familiar. That is exactly what Rahul Gandhi is striving for.” The white T-shirt has also been used by the Congress for its outreach. In January this year, the Congress offered Rahul Gandhi-signed white T-shirts to people who donated Rs 670 or more to the party’s Nyay Yatra, the east-to-west sequel of the south-north Bharat Jodo Yatra. The Congress in an X post on January 27 promoted the Nyay kit, which included a white T-shirt signed by Rahul Gandhi, to attract donors. (Image: @INCIndia via X) Like the Modi kurta or jacket, will the T-shirt-cargo look become a signature Rahul Gandhi style? “Modi no longer wears his signature kurta and jacket. He has moved himself up a rank from the time he was a chief minister or first-time prime minister,” says Cherian. As for Rahul Gandhi, the image guru says that the Congress leader can work with this style for the next 10 years. Though he will be 60 by then, like the Baby Boomers, India’s young will be carrying on with their sartorial choices. So, the white T-shirt is here to stay."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Riya was every bit the urban, cool Gen Z girl. With her finger on the pulse of every trend, she decided to find a partner on the dating apps. Her journey of three days from finding a match to chatting and ghosting was influenced by one single factor -- politics. As youngsters take to dating apps to find partners, one filter that is playing a crucial role is political views in this supercharged atmosphere of campaigning and voting for the 2024 Lok Sabha election. How a shared love for coffee and Coldplay comes to naught when it comes to political views is clear from Riya's experience. Riya had filled out all the details on the dating apps: her age, height, hobbies, smoking habits, drinking preferences. Then she uploaded the best pictures from her Instagram profile, and she was ready to dive in. Riya matched with Nikhil. They both enjoyed talking, they shared their love for Coldplay and Vietnamese coffee. All was well for two days. Then came the question: \"What are your political views?\" \"I'm a moderate. I don't think any party is doing so well that I will fight for them,\" she said. Riya couldn't have anticipated what was coming. Nikhil's tone changed. He said he hated moderates as they didn't care much about anything. \"He told me that people like me were part of the problem,” Riya said. That was the last time Riya and Nikhil spoke. She found him too harsh, and he found her too complacent. Their political stance made them forget they both loved Vietnamese coffee and Coldplay. Riya and Nikhil's case isn't an isolated incident. People on dating apps are now left-swiping (rejecting) the matches if they don't align with each other politically. Some dating apps like Bumble even have the option of putting a person's political ideology upfront on their profile even before they match. \"Often, you match with people who don't have their political leanings put out on the app. It can lead to uncomfortable conversations, while the initial chats and subsequently meeting up,\" Delhi-based Adil, who is a Bumble user, tells IndiaToday.In. Hence, a filter such as \"political leaning is of the utmost importance\", adds the 29-year-old marketing professional. A survey conducted by dating app Bumble found 20% of people considered it to be a \"turn-off\" if their dating app match did not have an opinion on key political and social issues. The survey conducted in December 2023 revealed that 39% of the respondents had already listed or were likely to list their political affiliation on dating apps. Having a political opinion is fine, but how does that influence dating choices? Do opposites attract or do youngsters with similar political views flock together? Research at Stanford Business School suggests that we tend to like people who have similar political leanings and opinions. This phenomenon is called \"homophily\". Most heated arguments at the dining table take place over political issues. Though families see people with diverse views, it might be difficult for young couples to handle the discomfort of dealing with divergent political ideologies. That's why people on dating apps are seeking more clarity on the political leanings of their matches. \"We need to know the political opinions because they can creep into our personal lives later on if and when it turns into a relationship. Some people support more aggressive and violent politics, tend to justify and normalise it, while others do not,\" Dhruv, a Hinge-user from Lucknow, tells IndiaToday.In. Youngsters also believe that political leanings tend to define a person and how they treat their partners. \"The politics and ideas of rigidity and violence can also translate into how people perceive their partners and treat them,\" adds Dhruv, a 21-year-old student. Ritika from Ghaziabad in the National Capital Region is active on dating apps and is looking for a match with moderate political views. She believes such a person wouldn't try to impose his views on her. \"I do not enjoy speaking to people who have extreme opinions on the left or the right. They impose their views on others. They are not very open-minded. As partners, these people can be imposing as well. That can get toxic,\" says Ritika. Most people who spoke to IndiaToday.In chose to reveal only their first names because of the personal nature of dating and other inhibitions. In a 2021 Bumble survey, 46% of respondents said they could not date someone whose political views were not aligned with theirs. Political leanings matter because they are everpresent during dates, from jokes to more serious discussions. \"Political leanings are evident from the very beginning of a conversation. Politics is there in the jokes we tell each other, and i the anecdotes. It is very fundamental to the way a person thinks, responds and acts,\" said Kavya, who is from Jaipur. Research by American social psychologist and author Jonathan Haidt found Left-leaning people to be more innovative and right-leaning individuals focussing more on loyalty and tradition. \"Political leaning matters as it shows what kind of person you are, and if you go by facts or feelings when it comes to deciding your leaders\", said 23-year-old Sakshi from Meerut. Sometimes our political leanings are also interconnected with our religious affiliations. Political parties sometimes claim to speak up for one religion or another. \"I am not a religious person, I feel having a partner who supports a party which associates too much with one religion can get uncomfortable for me,\" said marketing executive Adil. \"Many times political debates turn into religious debates and people start getting aggressive,\" said Sakshi, a Hinger user from Meerut. Though termed \"homophily\", this is a kind of \"social sorting\" for like-minded partners with politics as the filter. \"When I look at a prospective date, I do look at their political ideology a little. The thing is, political ideologies sometimes also translate into people's daily lives and habits. I have seen people who support right-wing parties are more religious, traditional and even family-oriented,\" said Shivang, a Bumble user from Patna. In a supercharged political atmosphere due to the heated campaigning for the Lok Sabha election, youngsters feel politics influences even our daily habits. Traditions, customs, eating habits, and what we watch are to an extent decided by our ideology and political leanings, according to the dating app users. \"As people on the right wing are more religious, they are also more likely to be vegetarian. For me, it is easier to date such a person,\" said Shivang. \"If a person shares my political ideology, they might also watch the same kind of movies, shows, memes and other content. Our sense of humour would also be similar. There are higher chances of the date fructifying into something long-term,\" he added. It might sound counter-intuitive, but dating apps are leading to long-term committed relationships in India. Scores of people have got married through Tinder and Bumble . That politics influences the shows we watch, the food we eat and the memes we share is understood. But does age also determine the political flexibility or rigidity of people who are dating? A survey in India by dating app happn found that age plays a crucial role in political flexibility when it comes to dating. The happn survey found about 65% of the respondents in India didn't believe that divergent political views should matter while picking a date. The survey found 44% of Gen Z people (18-25) were more willing to be flexible for matches. However, people above 36 showed greater level of rigidity, with 66% of the respondents preferring matches who shared their political views. People using dating apps are a cautious lot. Time is of essence when it comes to finding the right match, and the dating app users use politics as a filter to reduce any loss of time. \"I started chatting with a match and soon the discussion somehow veered towards politics. The conversation turned into a heated debate. It felt like we would not be compatible in the longer run. So, it was best to not get into it too much,\" said Niharika, a Hinge user from Delhi. A 2022 Bumble India survey revealed 28% of young women and 19% of men consider political views important in selecting or rejecting a partner. \"It comes to two things. Either one can have similar political leanings or an understanding and acceptance of the other person's leanings. When both are not possible, it is best to part ways,\" said Ritika from Ghaziabad. Dating is not for the meek-hearted. You will be scrutinised on how you look, what you do and who you support politically? Riya and Nikhil were united by the dating apps but were separated for good by their political ideologies. Politics is adding to our dating dilemma. People are swiping right or left depending on which end of the political spectrum they are on."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Twenty-five years ago, when Sunila Devi reached Jamna village in Himachal Pradesh's Sirmaur as a bride, her brother-in-law was in school. She used to pack rotis for his lunch. When the brother-in-law grew up, Sunila Devi's husband asked her to accept him as a husband too. \"One evening, it's the younger brother's turn, while it is the elder's the next,\" says Sunila Devi. Sunila Devi's story isn't something rare in the Trans-Giri region of Himachal Pradesh. Women of the Hatti community get married socially to a male member of a family but then go on to play the wife's role to other brothers, and mother to their children. Hattis recently received the status of a Scheduled Tribe and community leaders say the practice of polyandry played a key role in it getting the tag. There are 154 panchayats in the 1,300-square-km Trans-Giri area, and the Hatti community is present in 147 of them. Polyandry, referred to as 'Jodidaran' custom by the Hattis, is also practised by a few other communities in the lower Himalayas. Referred to as 'Draupadi Pratha', after Draupadi of the Mahabharata who had the five Pandavas as her husbands, polyandry is prevalent in Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh and certain areas of neighbouring Uttarakhand. The communities practising 'Draupadi Pratha' link the origins of the tradition to the strong-willed Draupadi, who kept the Pandavas together, and pushed them to join forces and defeat the Kauravas. Keeping the household together and preventing the fragmentation of small agricultural lands, especially in poorer families, is one of the key reasons why polyandry is still practised in the Hatti community. It isn't just a story of tradition, it is a tale of helplessness too. Amid clear skies and steep green hills, life is tough for the people here. Lack of resources seems to be the primary reason why a woman ends up being the wife to every brother. When Sunila Devi reached her marital home, poverty was written all over the walls. \"There was just one woollen sweater and one pair of slippers. So, my mother-in-law and I shared them,\" she says. \"When a sweater and a pair of slippers were being shared, I obviously had to be shared,\" Sunila says matter-of-factly. Though there is social equality in the Hatti community, the gender divide is clear from the time of birth. Sunila Devi of Jamna village in Sirmaur, Himachal Pradesh, isn't coy about answering any question that has to do with polyandry and her two husbands. (Photo: Mridulika Jha/India Today) If there is a community meal of mutton-rice organised at the birth of a boy, a girl's birth is a hushed whisper that dies crashing against the hills. Sunila, in her early 40s, isn't coy about 'Jodidaran Pratha' and her two husbands. She stares at the camera when asked for a photo. The look on the woman's face throws a challenge. Ask if you can, and I will answer it all. When Sunila reached Jamna as a bride 25 years ago, a single-room house sheltered the family. The newly-wed couple partitioned it, hanging a cloth with patches from a rope. Half-a-meal, half-a-room became Sunila's life. After some years, her husband brought up the issue one day. He told her to take his younger brother as a husband too. \"I often stay away from home for work, he will take care of you,\" he said. There was no pressure, the message was subtle and consistent. \"Do it, dear. The family will stay united,\" said her mother-in-law. Then it came from Sunila's father-in-law. \"There's so much poverty here, if you agree, even he can start a family.\" Sunila gave in. She gave conjugal rights to the man for whom she used to pack rotis for school. Wasn't it difficult for her? \"Why should getting into a joint-marriage not bother me? When my brother-in-law went to school, I packed his lunch. Then I had to fulfil his conjugal demands as a wife too. Struggle and sorrow continued together for many days in the beginning,\" says Sunila. Now, she calls the elder brother \"bade gharwala (elder husband)\" and his younger sibling \"chhote gharwala\" (younger husband). She has four children from the two brothers, and the younger brother has adopted the youngest child. The adoption of children from \"joint-marriages\" takes place under Wajib-ul-Arz, a document of record of the village, which gives sanctity to the \"Jodidaran Prata\". \"The name of the father gets into panchayat records through Wajib-ul-Arz, and that works for all official purposes,\" says Kundan Singh Shastri, general secretary of the Central Hatti Committee. Like Sunila, the children call the elder brother \"bade papa\" and the younger sibling \"chhote papa\". The Hatti are governed by the Hindu Marriage Act and for official purposes. However, there are provisions in Indian laws to protect the customs and traditions of its many tribes. Life is tough in the hilly terrain of Sirmaur in Himachal Pradesh. Male members of most families stay in the cities for work. (Photo: Mridulika Jha/India Today) Though the person that a woman is wedded to is considered her husband for legal purposes, there is social recognition for all her husbands. \"All three of us sit together for any religious ritual,\" says Sunila, adding, \"My relatives complain if I go to my parents' place with any one of the brothers. Both are our damaad (son-in-law), they say.\" Who of the two husbands loves her more? There is no clear response to that, but the word 'love' does light up her eyes, and brings a smile on her face. \"If you mean who takes care of me more, then I would say it's the younger one. He remembers what I like, takes care when I am unwell. Bada gharwala goes to the city for work, it is the chhota gharwala who stays at home,\" says Sunila Devi. And what about her? Whom does she love more? \"I have never discriminated between the two brothers when it comes to fulfilling my duties,\" she makes the question of love one about practicality. \"I serve them equal portions of the same food, make the same effort to wash their clothes. Even if there is something deep down in my mind, that never gets reflected in my words or actions towards them,\" she adds. Wasn't it difficult to fulfil the conjugal desires of two men? \"Yes, it was difficult, but bearing in mind the situation that we are in, there was no other way out. Accepted everything, even the physical hurt,\" says Sunila Devi. She says there was this constant fear if the younger brother brought home another woman, then who would look after all the children. \"Now they understand, and don't force themselves on me,\" she says. At a short distance away from Sunila Devi's house in Jamna village of Sirmaur is Meena Devi's residence. Meena Devi is married to three brothers and stays with them in a house made of wood with an asbestos roof. \"She was married to me. But I was not educated, and my family was poor. If three brothers married three different women, everything would have had to be split among the three,\" says the eldest brother, sitting on the floor of the house, near his two younger siblings. \"We huddled together one day and decided that a joint-marriage would be the best for us, and told her,\" he says, signalling at Meena Devi. Did she give her consent to it? The answer comes after a long pause and in a much softer tone. \"No, we didn't consult her. But she didn't disagree with being in a joint-marriage either.\" Didn't any issue ever crop up among the three brothers due to the joint-marriage arrangement? What if one of them desired to be with their wife, but it was someone else's turn? The brothers say it is all boild down to \"understanding\" and \"self-control\". It never came to fights and, according to them, Meena Devi is also happy. The youngest sibling says 'Jodidaran Pratha' is practical because the woman will continue having a husband and the children a father, even if the worst were to befall any one of the brothers. Meena Devi of Jamna village in Himachal's Sirmaur district says her husband and his two brothers decided how to take turns to be with her. (Photo: Mridulika Jha/India Today) Meena actually starts talking after her three husbands leave the room. \"When it was decided that we would be living in a joint-marriage, I started praying that I should love all of them equally,\" she says. \"They decided how to take turns to be with me. If one of the brothers goes to the city, the two others divide the days between themselves,\" says Meena Devi. Didn't she find it difficult to be with three men, fulfilling their demands? \"Why wouldn't it be difficult? I am also made of flesh and bones,\" says Meena. \"At times they have been adamant even when I hadn't been feeling up for it. I used to get irritable. Then the thought that they would get some other women into the house used to cross my mind, and I used to give in,\" she says. Having been pushed into polyandry due to poverty, will Meena Devi or others like her allow their children to practise Jodidaran or Draupadi Pratha? Meena Devi pat gave an assertive and convinced \"no\". Two of her sons have jobs and are married to different women. \"We have ensured that our daughters also don't have to get into Jodidaran Pratha,\" adds Meena Devi. Kundan Singh Shastri, general secretary of Hatti Central Committee, links the tradition of polyandry to the Pandavas who are believed to have stayed in the region for some time. \"The customs and traditions of the Hatti community are like those of the communities in the Jaunsar-Bawar region of Uttarakhand,\" he says. \"They got the Scheduled Tribe status long back, but it was given to us recently. Our customs, including Jodidaran, played a key role in getting us the ST status,\" says Shastri. Kundan Singh Shastri, general secretary of Hatti Central Coimmittee, says Jodidaran pratha or polyandry will die a slow death. (Photo: Mridulika Jha/India Today) Another villager of Jamna, Mukesh, says he knows that he is the fifth generation in his family to be in a \"joint-marriage\". This must have continued for centuries now, according to Mukesh. Mukesh and his elder brother are married to the same woman. \"I have the comfort of a wife and children even though I might be officially unmarried,\" he says. Will he encourage his daughter to be in a joint-marriage? \"She is an MA-BEd and will decide for herself. There is nothing wrong with Jodadaran Pratha, it provides security and is based on coordination,\" says Mukesh. \"Joint-marriages don't take place against the wish of any woman. The woman also gets more respect in the village, and within the family is consulted whenever the brothers fail to arrive at a decision in important matters,\" says Kundan Shastri, a leader of Hatti community. The tradition of polyandry, according to Shastri, can be found in the around 350 hamlets of Sirmaur district where the Hatti community resides. Shastri believes that with more and more villagers getting educated and moving out for jobs, Jodidaran among the Hatti people will die a slow death. That is exactly what is happening in Uttarakhand. Polyandry is losing ground in the hamlets of Jaunsar , where it was very common. \"We have survived the curse of poverty. No more of this Jodidaran Pratha for my children,\" says Meena Devi sitting in her house of wood and asbestos that has every basic essential now. As big drops of rain hit against the asbestos roof, Meena looks up with a smile. \"The rains are a blessing for us pahadi women. We can cry our hearts out while working in the rain, it veils our tears,\" she says. (Some names have been changed to conceal identity) (Interviews coordinated by Dinesh Kanojia)"

It was also a tight slap for those Pakistanis who said India would deliberately lose to the USA to get Pakistan out of the T20 World Cup tournament. India is the world's number one team, and can never lose to the US,\" a man in a black salwar kameez states emphatically, looking at the camera. The person isn't an Indian gushing at India's victory over the USA in a T20 World Cup match, but a Pakistani speaking to a popular Pakistani YouTuber at a market in Pakistan. The video by YouTuber Shaila Khan on her channel Naila Pakistani Reaction has over 3 lakh views in a day. Indians love people from abroad lauding their achievements, but seem to derive the biggest satisfaction when Pakistanis gush over India's success. Pakistanis have understood that and have tapped into that, creating an entire industry of YouTubers in Pakistan. There are 5,500 channels and over 84,000 videos just with the hashtag pakistanireactiononindia on YouTube. The number of channels, tracked by IndiaToday.In since November 2023, has grown by 1,000 in a matter of six months. Over 5,000 videos have been added under this hashtag since November. In the last six months, the number of channels using the hashtag #pakistanireactiononindia on YouTube increased by 1,000, and the number of videos by 5,000. (Credit: Social Media) We are talking about just one hashtag. There are several others with India-related content, some of which every Indian would have come across while scrolling through shorts and videos on YouTube. This content boom by Pakistani YouTubers has sparked a Praise India Movement in Pakistan. Seeing is believing, especially if it is about YouTube. So, just try keying in #Pakistani on the YouTube search bar. The first few results are Pakistani Reaction, Pakistani Reaction on India and Pakistani Public Reaction -- all to do with content related to India. Such is the rage that even #PakistaniDrama, one of Pakistan's biggest cultural exports, trends below the #PakistaniReaction. There was a flood of videos by Pakistani YouTubers lauding Team India right after their victory over the USA. Though cricket is one of the favourites, the range of 'praise India' videos spans from India's economic might to infrastructural developments; from gastronomic delights to space programmes. Then there are videos of Pakistanis describing in amazement their wonderful discoveries during their first visit to India. You name it, and they have it. There are Pakistani reaction clips to every Top 10 video, featuring India's shopping malls, highways, airports, college campuses, cars, bikes and even golgappas. As the frenzy to capture eyeballs got intense, some videos got ludicrous. What more, some of the YouTube channels have reactions to tutorial videos for UPSC Civil Service aspirants in India! One of the top viral videos is 'guess the city'. A YouTuber shows high-resolution, cinematic aerial shots of an Indian city and asks the participants to guess where it is located. Clueless Pakistanis mostly say Dubai and Singapore, which attract a 'wrong answer' shout from the host. Then a hint is dropped -- it's a neighbouring country. Still, the participants mostly answer Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. And is pleasantly surprised when told it is Bengaluru. Indians love that shock and awe on the face of the bewildered Pakistanis. There is plain economics behind the Praise India Movement in Pakistan. India is a far bigger country than Pakistan and with deeper internet penetration. \"Many of these YouTubers are aware of the fact that the market is in India. As a result, many of them target their content towards Indian viewers, often praising India or discussing Indian topics to get more clicks,\" Tilak Devasher, author of multiple books on Pakistan and member of the National Security Advisory Board, said during an ANI discussion. Explaining the trend, Devasher said, \"While I acknowledge that some of these programmes are genuine, many others are simply catering to Indian audiences for views. A lot of these people do it because YouTube pays.\" There were 111 million internet users in Pakistan in January 2024. The internet penetration rate in the Islamic Republic stood at 45.7% of the total population at the start of this year. The Indian market is seven times bigger. India had 751.5 million internet users in January 2024, with an internet penetration rate of 52.4% of the total population. Add to that the huge Indian diaspora in the US, Australia, the UK and other European and Middle Eastern countries. This huge market on offer is what the Pakistanis are making the most of in an economy where clicks mean money. One of the channels, which has over a million subscribers and is hosted by former journalist Sana Amjad, earns anywhere between $17,000 and $26,600 per month, according to Socialblade, an American social media analytics website. In stark contrast, the average monthly income for a Pakistani is barely $300. With 1,182 videos, the Sana Amjad channel has more than 1.01 million subscribers. (Image: Sana Amjad) \"The praise India thing works on two levels. The YouTubers know that the market is in India. When they say good things about India or praise India, it is to get clicks from India. I am not saying all of them do that, but some definitely do so,\" said Ajay Bisaria, former High Commissioner to Pakistan, during the discussion. The more serious type, said Bisaria, had genuine admiration for India and seriously discussed its achievements. \"There are serious people talking on the basis of facts and figures, like India reaching the Moon, India on its way to becoming the third-largest economy. That's genuine admiration,\" said Ajay Bisaria. That the people of India and Pakistan share cultural elements and a language makes generating content on India much easier for Pakistani YouTubers. For Indians, relating to and consuming such content is effortless. Gurugram-based design professional Shashank follows several of these Pakistani YouTubers and says that the phenomenon started during the Covid-induced lockdown. \"It started with podcasts on the history of the Indian Subcontinent and commentaries on cricket. Initially, the content was rather good,\" Shashank tells IndiaToday.In. \"With time, a pattern emerged, and some of the content started getting a bit jingoistic,\" he adds. Shashank says there's a kind of curiosity among the people of both countries towards each other, which leads to the consumption of such YouTube videos. When it comes to reaction videos, Pakistani Reacts was one of the earliest channels to break into the scene, based on Jaby Koay's reaction channel on everything Indian. Jaby Koay is an American and pioneered YouTube reactions to Indian films and songs. For Prakhar, like many others from India, the initial attraction was analysis videos of Pakistani cricketers Rashid Latif, Salman Butt and Waheed Khan. Former Pakistan test captain Rashid Latif and former PTV Director, author Nauman Niaz are the face of the Caught Behind YouTube channel. (Credit: Caught Behind) \"However, with time, the content started getting produced in bulk. Then came the videos of bulk-reaction. From cricket, I was watching Pakistanis reacting to everything Indian content, from songs to vlogs to street food,\" Gurugram-based Prakhar tells IndiaToday. A couple of years after the lockdown, the Pakistani reaction video scene on YouTube exploded with a huge number of videos being produced daily for consumption, especially by people based in India, or Indians in the US, Canada or Europe. Churning out these YouTube videos on a regular basis are Real entertainment tv, Sana Amjad, Naila Pakistani Reaction, News Views and Updates, Tatla Family, Supari Reacts, Nimra Ahmad Official and dozens of other Pakistanis like them. Naila and Shaila reacted to a YouTube video on the Reasi attack, that killed nine Hindu pilgrims in Jammu and Kashmir. (Image: Naila Pakistani Reaction) The Real Entertainment TV channel run by the energetic and blunt Sohaib Chaudhry, with more than a million YouTube subscribers, releases reaction videos on social issues, current affairs and world affairs. Chaudhry, who calls himself an activist, focusses on political developments in India. The channel News Views and updates, run by the Lahore-based brother-sister duo Iman and Moazzam, is a sit-down reaction of the siblings on developments in India. Be it the inauguration of the Bandra Worli Sealink in Mumbai , or one of those UPSC mock interview videos, or PM Modi's oath-taking ceremony, Iman and Moazzam watch them all, along with their around six lakh subscribers. They now have a vlogging channel as well, with one lakh subscribers. The most popular channel in the genre is the one of Sana Amjad, a former journalist. Sana's content, mostly from the streets of Pakistan's Punjab, is known to feature some of the viral videos that became popular on YouTube Shorts. A viral video where a Pakistani man makes a desperate plea saying, \"Humein sirf PM Modi chahiye...\" was from Sana Amjad's channel. The view count of these videos is testament to how popular they are on YouTube. The comment sections of these videos are flooded by Indians, mostly with taunts and jokes, and show how well the 'Praise India' content has reached its intended audience. Sana Amjad's channel churns out two-three videos daily for its audience of a lakh subscribers. Shaila Khan's Naila Pakistan posted another video after the rain-washed match on Friday got Pakistan booted out of T20 World Cup. The video, named 'Pakistan Team Out of T20 World Cup', shows Pakistanis crying at their cricket team's performance. There were sharp reactions from the Pakistani aawam in the video. \"She asks some funny questions to the public. Entertainment for Indians, so very funny and good channel,\" commented an Indian user among the sea of comments by Indians. On average, the channel 'Naila Pakistani Reaction' publishes around a couple of videos a day, each with more than a lakh views. The reaction video shot after India defeated Pakistan in the T20 World Cup has more than 15 lakh views. The Partition of 1947 divided Indians and Pakistanis with concertina wire and suspicions. These praise-India videos, though a direct result of internet economics, somehow work to demystify the stereotypes and ideas people of the two nations have for each other. That too with oodles of humour that Pakistanis are known for."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story \"Wow I’d never heard of this dish! Thank you so much for bringing it to us.. Will definitely try it this way,\" said a delighted Mumbai-based food enthusiast on an Instagram reel posted by British food influencer Jake Dryan. The Englishman hadn't cooked a Yorkshire pudding or shepherd's pie, but mati dali (black lentils), as part of his Assamese cuisine week. Jake Dryan, Andrea, Chey Singh, Sarah Todd and Beryl Shereshewsky are among a breed of food influencers who are cooking desi regional dishes that many Indians are alien to, and, thus, throwing a new culinary challenge to them. None of these influencers are Indian. If Jake Dryan is from the UK, Andrea is a German, and Sarah Todd an Australian, while Beryl Shereshewsky is based in New York. These people from different corners of the world have one thing in common -- their love for Indian cuisine. The world gets a glimpse of that love through their Instagram reels and YouTube shots. Combined, they have millions of followers across several social media platforms. Though foreign chefs, like the legendary Keith Floyd, ladling a kadhai of Indian broth is nothing new, what is actually fresh is that these non-Indian food influencers and vloggers are taking to social media to highlight dishes from far corners of India. That too in videos of shorter duration than it needs to boil Maggi. \"It's really fascinating to see how so many foreign influencers are sharing reels and shorts on regional Indian cuisines on Instagram and YouTube, because it it's the mainstream Indian food or restaurant food that is popular across the world,\" Pankaj Bhadouria, the winner of MasterChef India Season 1, tells IndiaToday.in. It is heartening to see these foreign influencers cook regional food like sattu ka parantha, says Bhadouria, who runs a restaurant in the gastronomic city of Lucknow. The cultural diversity of India is best manifested in its cuisine. In a land of myriad cultures like India, there exists a rich tapestry of regional delicacies, each bursting with unique flavours and spices, each needing different spices and cooking utensils. The confluence of cuisines started mostly during the Doordarshan and cable TV days with hosts like Tarla Dalal, Jiggs Kalra and Sanjeev Kapoor. Then came chefs like Sanjay Thumma, Vikas Khanna, Ranveer Brar and Kunal Kapoor. Cooking shows and YouTube channels made them the staple of every kitchen. E-commerce helped too. Regional condiments and spices, earlier restricted to certain states, reached every corner of India. However, it is a whole new breed of food influencers -- both Indian and foreigner -- who are popularizing Indian regional dishes, one culinary delight at a time. If the Indian influencers are inspiring Indians, the foreigners are in a way challenging them -- if we can, why can't you? “Dude is teaching Indians about India because most of us are so into our own culture that we forget India is vast and varied,” commented a follower on an Insta reel by Jake Dryan on chaunsa dal of Uttarakhand. Indians are watching keenly, and taking up the challenge of cooking these dishes from various regions, hitherto ignored by them. UK-based Jake Dryan, with 1.8 million followers on Instgram, is one of the most celebrated influencers when it comes to regional Indian dishes. Many Indians said they found out about Assamese mati dali from Dryan's reel, and said they would attempt to make it. His sattu ka parantha from Bihar and dal bati choorma from Rajasthan were other big hits. Jake Dryan even had entire weeks dedicated to cuisines from Assam, Bengal, Odisha, Haryana, Karnataka and Telangana. Jake, who has presented food from 17 different states of India, has been lauded by his Instagram followers for making desi dishes in the most authentic way possible. In May last year, Jake's videos of perfect methi theplas went viral with a million views on Instagram. Though Jake has no Indian associations other than his childhood friends and has never visited India, several other foreign vloggers started cooking Indian dishes after getting married to Indians. A German by birth, Andrea not only married Monty from Punjab but Indian cuisine along with him. Now, her Instagram page, featuring Indian dishes she cooks for her husband with a sprinkling of love, has 169K followers. Andrea cooks all things Indian, from lachcha parantha, to baingan bharta to besan shimla mirch sabzi. But how do Indians react to non-Indian cooking non-mainstream dishes? \"The reactions are incredibly positive and many are grateful that I share all these recipes with them,\" Andrea tells IndiaToday.In. \"They say thank you because I show them dishes that they have never tried in their own country, or simply inspire them to try out new dishes,\" she adds. Andrea, who stays in Passau, Germany, says she started cooking Indian food on some days for her husband, who is from Punjab. Now, she says she cooks Indian food 365 days of the year, and jokes that she finds it difficult to think of German recipes. (Image: Andrea/we_coffeemilkfamily/Instagram) In a post on baingan bharta, Andrea, who is based in Germany's Passau, wrote, \"What I love about this dish is the whole process of frying the eggplant. Of course, it would be better to cook over a gas flame or open fire. Both options are only available to us when the weather is nice.\" In the comments section, people thanked her for the recipe. \"I was searching for this recipe because in England we only have electric stoves. So, I thought it was impossible, but you made it possible. Thank you ma'am,\" read one of the comments. Andrea, whose Instagram handle is we_coffeemilkfamily, fuses German and Indian food, and also combines North and South Indian dishes in one meal. \"My husband comes from North India, but that doesn’t mean that we only eat dishes from North India. I dared to try a few dishes from South India a while ago and fell in love with this cuisine straight away. So, it has now become a regular feature in our kitchen,\" says Andrea. \"All regions of India have an impressive range of culinary delights. However, what I like to do for myself is to combine dishes from different parts of India and experiment and possibly create new dishes,\" she tells IndiaToday.In. Chey Singh is another popular food vlogger with 230k followers on Instagram and 190k on YouTube. Her shorts on Indian meals went viral. She has several reels on her packing rice and sabzi for her husband in a lunch box, with the hashtag satire. At times, Chey Singh gives a tangy twist to the traditional dishes. In a recent video, she made rajma-chawal (kidney beans and rice) with amchur (mango powder). And the Indians loved it. \"I've never tried it with Mango powder. Going to try adding it next time. Looks so good,\" read one of the comments on her Instagram page. It is also the twist these food influencers, who are mostly not professional chefs, give to Indian foods that is lapped up by Indians. How did Andrea from Germany or Jake Dryan from the UK learn to cook Indian regional dishes? Andrea, who used to try her hand at European cuisines, admits that until a few years ago, she used to go to restaurants for Indian, Chinese or Thai food \"because I found it impossible to cook them myself at home\". However, married to a Sikh from Punjab, she soon found inspiration at home. \"I actually get most of my inspiration from housewives. I don't follow any famous master chefs,\" says Andrea when asked if she follows any professional chefs. \"For me, every mom or grandmother is the best master chef and they know the best tips and tricks. But my first and biggest inspiration is still my mother-in-law and my sister-in-law,\" says Andrea, who started posting food reels on Instagram some 1.5 years ago. Jake Dryan has no association with India and took an unusual route. His Indian culinary journey began while playing in a band as a 12-year-old with friends of Gujarati descent in London. \"It was there, in their homes, where I first tasted traditional Indian dishes like Dhokla, igniting my passion for Indian cuisine,\" says Jake. Walking in the footsteps of his Italian grandfather who was a chef, Jake went to culinary school and then spent eight years at a busy London restaurant. It was his 2022 videos on South Indian dishes and the followers he gained that got him to explore Indian cuisine. His video of rava idli and sambhar had 2.5 million views . And the rest, as they say, is gastronomy. How did Jake, who has never been to India, become an expert in Indian cooking? \"I've honed my skills through self-practice, asking countless questions, and watching numerous YouTube tutorials over the years,\" reveals Jake Dryan on his plant-future website. What Indians are finding interesting is the fresh perspective that the foreign food vloggers are bringing with them. \"The foreign food vloggers are giving a fresh new perspective of how the world sees our food, which is different from how Indian chefs see it,\" MasterChef Pankaj Bhadouria tells IndiaToday.in. What minute details Indian chefs might take for granted is captured well by these foreign vloggers. Australian model Sarah Todd shot to fame and gained 50,000 followers after cooking aloo-gobi in MasterChef Australia's sixth season. Todd has 501k followers on Instagram and 725k on YouTube. The single mom had a restaurant in Goa and was dividing her time between India and Australia. When Australian Masterchef contestant Sarah Todd was in Mumbai in April last year, she wanted to \"indulge in all the amazing local dishes the city has to offer\". (Image: @sarahtodd/Instagram) New York-based food vlogger, Beryl Shereshewsky, has 799k subscribers on YouTube and 182k followers on Instagram. She has posted videos on kadhi, South Indian gun powder and even a paani-puri fountain. Chhole or chickpeas seem to be the favourite of the YouTuber, who got married to an Indian in 2016 in Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, in an elaborate Indian-style wedding ceremony. In Beryl's case, it's also the Uno reverse, as she, at times, cooks dishes that her followers request her to. What is magical is how the foreign food influencers have shrunk Indian slow-food into 90-second reels. \"I have really enjoyed watching their reels. Some of them do a fantastic job in these ASMR videos. To produce something foreign to them in such short videos is fascinating,\" says Pankaj Bhadouria. Bhadouria sees these reels and shorts as a natural progression. She believes, just like Indian chefs do different cuisines; Italian risoto or a Thai curry, foreign influencers are trying Indian regional cuisines. \"I would say the world today has shrunk on our plate,\" summarises Bhadouria. With the world, the various regions of India have shrunk onto our plates too. And non-Indian influencers are playing an interesting role in this by challenging us with 90-second clips."

These funds have gone towards improving education, healthcare and employment opportunities for tribal communities.

We have implemented the world’s largest insurance scheme, improved doctor-patient ratio and begun reducing critical indicators such as maternal and child mortality and the burden of various diseases. However, if the country is ever to be at par with advanced healthcare systems such as the US, Japan or the UK, there has to be more financial investment. According to the medical journal Lancet, government spending on health has declined, hovering at a meagre 1.2 per cent of the GDP in the past few years. The government, though, says its expenditure has increased, from 1.13 per cent in 2014-15 to 1.35 per cent of the GDP in 2019-20. This is expected to hit 2.5 per cent by 2025, as per the National Health Policy, 2017."

The plan to generate 50 per cent of all its power using cleaner fuels by 2030, from 44 per cent at present and attain net-zero emissions by 2070 are bold commitments on the climate action front."

The Covid-19 pandemic and then geopolitical disturbances like the Russia-Ukraine war, Israel-Hamas conflict and Red Sea crisis have led to business closures, supply chain disruptions, logistics cost spikes and volatile input costs. Consequently, many MSMEs faced losses due to damaged inventory and forgone sales. “In today’s globalised environment,” notes Anil Bhardwaj, secretary-general, Federation of Indian MSMEs, “institutional responses must consider the impact of geopolitical developments on small businesses.” And that precisely is the task that Jitan Ram Manjhi and his ministry have to embark on forthwith."

Nearly 95 per cent of India’s overseas trade by volume is carried out via its ports. Yet, the country accounts for just over 10 per cent of the global deadweight tonnage. The government has been trying to make amends through the flagship Sagar Mala programme, harnessing India’s 7,500 km coastline, 14,500 km of potentially navigable waterways and strategic location on key international maritime trade routes. The results are showing—India’s rank in international shipment category has jumped from 44 in 2014 to 22 now. The importance of the ministry can be gauged from the fact that on May 13, in the middle of the seven-phase Lok Sabha polls, minister Sarbananda Sonowal visited Iran’s Chabahar port to witness the signing ceremony of the Long-term Main Contract for its development—an India-Iran flagship project. Amid the ongoing wars in Ukraine and West Asia, this project will serve as a trade route connecting India with Afghanistan and the Central Asian countries."

    "article_content": "T he Union ministry of road transport and highways has been one of the crowning achievements of the Modi government, with significant progress in the building of new highways and greenfield expressways across India. The legal framework governing the transport sector and road safety underwent a major overhaul with the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act in 2019. But all of this good work is undone by the inability to reduce road deaths and crashes, where India continues to top global lists. The coming years will require the government to address the slowdown of projects and missed deadlines. Improving the financial health of its premier highway-building agency, the National Highways Authority of India, will also be a top priority. The agency is burdened by a colossal debt of over Rs 3.4 lakh crore. A large portion of its funds goes into servicing this debt, leaving it with little wriggle room for investments in new projects. The government has several plans to ease this burden in the next few years, one of which is to issue Infrastructure Investment Trusts to take funds from investors and invest in profitable projects. Moreover, the ministry also has ambitious plans to roll out innovative tech. These include implementing GPS-based, contactless toll collection on highways and establishing electric corridors for trucks. These initiatives aim to modernise India’s road infrastructure and improve efficiency, but how well and how soon they can be implemented will be criticial to their success. The Modi government’s third term will be tested on the viability of these promises and if it can translate them into tangible outcomes."

Closer home, as Pakistan extended an olive branch on the occasion of Modi’s oath-taking on June 9, India stayed firm on its stand of peace being contingent on cessation of terror."

Besides, there is the unfinished business of the last term—rollout of the Uniform Civil Code, Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens—though coalition dharma may put these on the back burner. New laws, including the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, replacing the Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code and the Indian Evidence Act, also need implementation. Then there is the national census, a project that is already three years behind schedule, and may now see a demand for a castewise count. The Women’s Reservation Bill is another pending promise that should ideally come to fruition this term. But not before a delimitation exercise. There is plenty then to occupy the home minister and his team."

On defence manufacturing, it has promised to continue support for start-ups, so that indigenisation can be accelerated. The other emphasis is to increase exports of Made in India defence equipment. In the 2023–24 financial year, defence exports reached a record high of Rs 21,083 crore (around $2.63 billion). The government has set up a target of Rs 35,000 crore by 2025. Continuing robust vigilance along the tense Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China is an imperative too, along with managing internal security threats, including insurgencies and terrorism. Adapting to the military/ security challenges posed by climate change—like the threat rising sea levels pose to naval bases—are on the agenda. Defence strategists point to the need to enhance the frequency of military training exercises with countries in West and Southeast Asia. The armed forces should also have a greater role in acquiring defence platforms. Visualising future battlefield environments would lead to the formulation of a capability development plan, which would direct acquisitions and indigenisation."

Nirmala Sitharaman, who held a steady guiding hand all through, may need a new tack this time. She has to rev up slothful sectors while easing mass distress. Expect higher social spends and capex outlays in her upcoming budget in July. It will be challenging, considering the global slowdown that is only just easing, and there is no quickfix for rising unemployment. She also has to steer inflation to tolerable levels amid fears of NPAs returning to the banking system."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story P rime Minister Narendra Modi, true to form, has hit the ground running with his new 72-member cabinet. Nine alliance partners, out of the 24 who were part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), find a place. Even though the mandate he had hoped for did not happen, Modi showed his political muscle by keeping all the critical portfolios for his party. The message was clear: he would run the government his way, majority or not. The selection of key ministers signalled continuity. There has been a hiatus in policymaking since March 16, when the Model Code of Conduct came into force, so there is a sense of urgency. Before the general election, Modi had chalked out a 125-day agenda, which probably has to be amended considering the lessons to be taken from the reduced mandate. Undoubtedly, in his previous two terms, Modi aggressively addressed the basic needs of a majority of Indians—food, drinking water, sanitation, housing, cooking gas. And, if you take out the Covid years, the economy grew at a reasonable rate. He has other stellar achievements to his credit, such as fiscal prudence, cleaning the banking system, popularising digital payments and huge investments in infrastructure. He transformed India in many ways. But the new regime has to intro­spect on the key points that denied it a full majority. India faces systemic challenges that require a holistic reset. It must simultaneously tend to wounds that call for immediate suturing and perhaps a change in the style of functioning. Modi 3.0 has to be mindful of a more vigorous Opposition. All eyes will soon be on the full Union Budget in July. Nirmala Sitharaman is at the wheel again as finance minister. She would do well to heed the two most significant issues in the election cam­paign: jobs and inflation. Related to that is acute rural distress. No wonder the BJP has a nearly 25 per cent drop in rural seats. The problem is systemic. Agriculture represents under 15 per cent of the GDP but employs an estimated 44 per cent of the working population—supporting about 70 per cent of rural households. While manufacturing, where many future jobs should come from, still constitutes only 17 per cent of the GDP and employs a stagnant 12 per cent of the population. For decades, no government has been able to move the needle significantly by shifting agriculture workers, whose productive capacities are clearly under-utilised, to other gainful employment. Unemployment rates have been the subject of much-heated throwing about of data, but no amount of statistical sorcery can hide the despair among young job-seekers. A recent study co-authored by the International Labour Organization can serve as a marker: it talks of 29.1 per cent joblessness among graduates and, more alarmingly, one-third of young Indians being neither in a job nor in education or training! Professor Arvind Panagariya, recently appointed chairperson of the Finance Commission, defined India’s problem very well in one of his lectures. He says the problem is smallness. Our agriculture holdings are too small. Holdings smaller than 2 hectares account for 86 per cent of all holdings. These don’t lend themselves to scaling up via mechanisation and are highly unproductive. This is where the farm laws that were derailed would have helped. The new agriculture minister, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, has a proven track record: as chief minister, he gave Madhya Pradesh an agricultural growth rate double that of the national average over the past decade. Maybe he can craft a new policy to win everyone’s endorsement. Prof. Panagariya also points out how dispersed our population is. Over 76 per cent live in habitations of less than 5,000. This makes the delivery of basic amenities far more complex. India must urbanise more, but we must fix our crumbling cities with better urban planning and local governance. Another area of smallness is business enterprises. Around 72 per cent of the workforce in industry and services is employed in enterprises that have less than 10 workers, while only 18 per cent are employed in enterprises with 20 or more workers. The dominance of small enterprises and the relative absence of medium and large enterprises prevents the creation of high-productivity, high-wage jobs on a large scale. China has a 75 per cent manufacturing workforce in medium and large enterprises, as opposed to only 16 per cent in India. There has to be a rescue plan for our 63 million MSMEs so that they can offer productive jobs. A sector-specific push can get things moving on several fronts: for instance, in textiles, a sector that has the capacity to absorb a large workforce, or in pharma and food processing. T he services sector is the best news for the Indian economy. The fastest to rebound after the pandemic, it has been growing at above 8 per cent, with its exports going from $325.3 billion in FY23 to $339.6 billion in FY24. The biggest failure in services is the neglect of inbound foreign tourism. In 2019, the best common pre-pandemic year for comparison, India got under 18 million international arrivals while Thailand (less than one-sixth our size) got nearly 40 million. We earned $30.06 billion from foreign tourists, Thailand $64.37 billion. With all our heritage, beaches, mountains and game reserves, the potential is immense. This should definitely be a thrust area. But revving up manufacturing will be key. Here, despite the government’s best efforts on the ease of doing business front, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been on a downward slope. In 2022-23, FDI inflows fell from the previous year’s $84.8 billion to $71.4 billion, down 16 per cent. In 2023-24, it stagnated at $70.9 billion. Uncertainties related to tax liabilities, delays in obtaining tax refunds, difficulties in enforcing contracts and a maze of complex rules—all spook those who may have otherwise been India-bound. The decline in merchandise exports—from $451 billion in FY23 to $437 billion in FY24—frames the crisis. This week, we put out a full Agenda for Modi 3.0, ticking boxes across ministries: from the hard decisions awaited in areas like labour reforms to the need to hold our own in foreign policy and trade pacts, an alignment of education goals with skilling to create a “future-ready” youth, to a relook at Agniveer. Modi 3.0 also has to continue its reform agenda, especially disinvesting from white elephants in the public sector and continue building infrastructure. That’s the kind of 360-degree policymaking we need. Governing a democracy like India is the most challenging job in the world, reforming it even more so. PM Modi loves challenges. Well, he has got himself a mighty one."

Sporting triumphs are an index Who better to helm the ministry than the man who made MP an agri powerhouse. Can he do the same for the nation? The rural landscape is in the midst of a transformative journey, as multidimensional poverty sees a decline. But there is much catching up to do with rising aspirations The ambition is intact, but progress slow on the flagship Jal Jeevan and Namami Gange projects Given the immense potential of the sector, efficient implementation of government schemes can help it grow by leaps and bounds Empowering the fisheries sector and the national livestock census will be top priority Educational reform is unfinished business. More resources and full adoption of NEP are a must to end disparities, fill vacancies and train teachers To cash in on its demographic advantage, India must revamp its skilling infrastructure with aid from the industry Conserving and promoting India’s rich heritage can generate jobs and spur other sectors too If the government is to realise its grand promises of a green revival, it needs to show unwavering commitment. Pollution and depleting forest cover remain major worries Providing adequate and quality healthcare to a large population is a challenge. The immediate task is to provide affordable treatment and tackle the burden of spiraling non-communicable diseases Be it chemicals, fertilisers or raw material for pharmaceuticals, India must reduce its huge reliance on imports The Ayush ministry must push for rigorous treatment protocol based on science and ensure new and high-quality products Puri's return signals a welcome continuity. Oil production and green fuels remain a challenge Reforms in the power sector are key to meeting the exponential growth in demand for electricity The ministry will have to revive projects that are in a limbo, such as Smart Cities, while also working to introduce sustainable urban mobility solutions Joshi's big challenge, apart from synergies with the power ministry, will be to popularise the green fuels of the future Managing buffer stocks and PDS disbursal are the challenge and the prize for the ministry Reviving BSNL and BharatNet, along with the rollout of the Telecom Act, top the to-do list Political and financial empowerment apart, women need safety in homes and outside If the country has to own a piece of the future, it must both deepen research and bring things up to speed in a dynamic tech era The need of the hour is to prioritise the appointment of judges and infrastructure to expedite faster justice delivery and reduce the economic impact on citizens With the BJP losing its majority, the parliamentary affairs ministry has to navigate the increased Opposition strength and unpredictable allies to ensure smooth functioning of the House The government needs to boost its commitment to the welfare of India's vast tribal communities Actor-musician Shruti Haasan opens up about collaborating with her father Kamal Haasan and more"

Modi walked straight to his spartan corner office and the first document he signed was an order authorising the release of the 17th instalment of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi to distribute Rs 2,000 each to the 93 million farmers in the country, an expense of Rs 20,000 crore for the exchequer. For Modi, this was all familiar territory—he has been here, done this for the past 10 years, over two terms. But there is a clear difference this time. Unlike the previous stints, he is heading a coalition government in his third term, Election 2024 having thrown up a verdict that saw the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) surprisingly falling short of a simple majority of 272 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha. The party won 240 seats, 32 short of the required halfway mark. That has left it dependent on its 24 National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners, who won 53 seats, to run the government. A warm welcome for PM Modi as he arrives at the PMO on Day 1 of Term 3.0, Jun. 10"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Police in Karnataka’s Hassan district have registered an FIR against two individuals accused of blackmailing JD(S) MLC Suraj Revanna, the brother of sex crimes-accused former MP Prajwal Revanna, over a false sexual assault allegation. According to the FIR, Suraj Revanna (36) and his acquaintance Shivakumar filed a complaint against a party worker and his brother-in-law, alleging they demanded money in exchange for not defaming Revanna. The man initially befriended Shivakumar and requested his help in securing a job, citing financial distress. Shivakumar agreed to introduce him to Revanna during the recent Lok Sabha election period. On June 17, the man called Shivakumar, claiming he had visited Revanna's farmhouse the previous day to ask for a job but was turned down. The man then allegedly threatened to defame Revanna and his family, stating that he would file a police complaint alleging sexual molestation if his demand for Rs 5 crore was not met. The man then allegedly continued to blackmail Shivakumar, reducing his demand to Rs 3 crore and eventually Rs 2.5 crore. His brother-in-law also allegedly participated in the blackmail, sending messages from his phone. On June 19, he again called Shivakumar, threatening to defame Revanna's family if the money was not paid. Two days later, Shivakumar and Revanna decided to lodge a complaint against him and his brother-in-law, leading to the registration of the FIR under Sections 384 (extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. Meanwhile, the party worker alleged that Suraj Revanna sexually assaulted him on June 16 at a farmhouse in Gannikada, Hassan district. \"He had put his hands on my shoulder and moved his hands everywhere. Thereafter, what shouldn't have happened, happened to me,\" he said. He claimed that Revanna's associates tried to blackmail and manipulate him, offering money and a job to cover up the incident. He initially approached the Holenarasipura Town Police station to file a complaint but was allegedly refused. He then went to the DG office in Bengaluru, where he filed his complaint. Speaking about the case, Union Minister Pralhad Joshi said, \"Whoever commits the crime will have to face the law. The investigation is ongoing.\" This development comes just days after former JD(S) MP Prajwal Revanna, accused of rape and sexual abuse, was remanded to judicial custody by a special court in Bengaluru. Revanna lost his bid to retain the Hassan parliamentary constituency in the recent elections. He was arrested by SIT officials upon his return from Germany on May 31. The initial arrest stemmed from an April 28 case in Hassan, where he was accused of sexually harassing a former house help . He now faces charges in three separate sexual assault cases, including allegations of rape."

In a statement on the demolition action following a backlash from former Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy, the TDP said the office was being built illegally on two acres of Irrigation Department land. The action came after a TDP leader lodged a complaint with the commissioners of the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) and Mangalagiri Tadepalli Municipal Corporation (MTMC), PTI reported. #WATCH | CORRECTION | Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh: YSRCP's under-construction* central office in Tadepalli was demolished today early morning.

It is now clarified that the Irrigation Department has not given the clearance to hand over these two acres to the YSRCP,\" the TDP statement further said. Reacting to the demolition of his party's office, Jagan Reddy accused Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu of \"taking vendetta politics to the next level\" and \"acting like a dictator\". Reddy alleged that the action was taken disregarding High Court orders. \"Like a dictator, he got YSRCP's central office demolished with excavators and bulldozers, which was almost complete,\" the former Chief Minister said in a post on X. In a statement, the opposition party said the court had ordered a stay on demolition activity, and it was conveyed to the CRDA commissioner. The party claimed the government authority's action amounted to contempt of court. Jagan Reddy said law and justice had \"completely vanished\" in Andhra Pradesh under the Naidu government. The YSRCP chief said the party would not be intimidated by such actions and promised to \"fight for the people\"."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Karnataka MLC Suraj Revanna, who was arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a Janata Dal (Secular) worker, had sex with him despite the latter's objections and said it would be \"better next time\", according to an FIR. Suraj Revanna, the brother of rape-accused former JD(S) MP Prajwal Revanna had sex with the party worker, at his farmhouse in Gannikada in Karnataka's Hassan on June 16. The FIR unravelled the horror that the party worker went through when he was sexually assaulted by Suraj Revanna. During the assault, Suraj Revanna told the victim that it was his first time having sex with him and said the experience would be better next time. He also promised him a job if he agreed to be with him. According to the FIR, around 2 pm on June 16, Suraj invited him to his farmhouse and asked him to arrive between 6:00 pm to 6:15 pm that evening. At the appointed time, the victim reached Suraj's farmhouse. As the JD(S) worker entered the room, Suraj directed him to shut the door. Without warning, Suraj placed his hands on the victim's shoulders, then caressed his ears before kissing him. What began as a subtle advance quickly escalated, with Suraj biting the party worker's lips and promising career support if he consents to be with him. Overwhelmed with fear, the victim protested against Suraj Revanna for his actions, the FIR said. This was met with menace as Suraj invoked his family's influence and threatened to kill him if he continued to protest. Suraj Revanna, as per the FIR, dragged the victim to his bedroom, where he hugged him tightly, bit his cheeks, and touched his private parts. The assault continued as Suraj Revanna forced the party worker into unwanted physical acts, engaging in oral and anal sex despite the latter's clear discomfort and pleas for cessation. During the assault, the victim cried and fell at Suraj Revanna's feet, begging him to stop. But Suraj Revanna continued his assault, rationalising the ordeal by saying it would become easier with time. According to the FIR, Suraj then kissed the victim and assured him of help in growing his political stature, and that he would get him a job. However, he said all such things would happen if the party worker would obey him at all costs and meet him whenever he wished to and respond to his messages properly. Suraj Revanna, in the FIR, demanded an apology from the victim for not cooperating with him during his advances, and then asked him to reply to his message once he returned home. Suraj Revanna also asked Chetan to relax and wished him good night. The party worker went into depression after the incident and later narrated his ordeal to Suraj Revanna's aide, Shivakumar, who belongs to Hanumanahalli village. Suraj Revanna came to Kollangi village in Hassan during the Lok Sabha elections and met the victim during that time. They both exchanged phone numbers and Suraj spoke of meeting him later, the FIR said. On June 14 evening, Suraj Revanna sent a 'good evening' message with a heart emoji to which the victim responded, saying, 'very good evening'. During the conversation, Suraj Revanna asked Chetan about his studies, his whereabouts and what he had been doing. He expressed his wish to meet him. The JD(S) worker said he would meet him whenever he came to Arkalgud in Hassan. However, Suraj Revanna refused and told him to meet at his farmhouse instead. Suraj Revanna continued to send messages to him like 'good morning' and 'good morning'. On the night of June 17, at approximately 10:11 pm, the JD(S) worker messaged Suraj Revanna, expressing how deeply he was hurt by the incident. He said he was scolded by his family after he confessed to them, and he refrained from going home. The victim asked Suraj Revanna and his aide Shivakumar, in separate messages, to support him, saying his life had been ruined. Later that night, Shivakumar picked up the victim in a car, asserting that Suraj Revanna had been informed. He indicated that money would be given to the victim, but cautioned him against speaking out or filing a complaint, under threat of being killed. The next day, Shivakumar pressured the JD(S) worker to accept these terms. Suraj Revanna, over the phone, proposed a deal involving a sum of 2 crores and a job as compensation, according to the FIR. Due to the victim's health issues following the sexual assault, Suraj Revanna instructed that Shivakumar would handle any hospital registration, forbidding the victim from doing it himself. Chetan refused the terms, fearing for his life, and fled to his paternal uncle's house. On June 19, Shivakumar confronted the victim and reiterated his threat, should he disclose the incident to anyone. Determined to see justice served, the victim messaged Suraj and said that justice must prevail and punishment be meted out to him. He communicated the same to Shivakumar. That evening, Shivakumar intercepted the party worker and took him to a lodge in Holenarasipura with dinner facilities, pressuring him to pay Rs 1,000. The victim managed to escape that night, heading to Bengaluru. Shivakumar then blackmailed the worker, threatening to file an extortion case against him. Desperate and in fear, the JD(S) worker went to the DGP's office with a written complaint, sending a photo of it to Suraj and Shivakumar, indicating his intention to file it before deleting the message, the FIR said. The victim assured in his complaint that he possessed necessary evidence and emphasised the life threat from Suraj Revanna to himself and his family."

HD Revanna's remarks came after Suraj Revanna, an MLC, who is the brother of rape-accused former MP Prajwal Revanna, was arrested in Hassan today on charges of \"unnatural offences\" against him, police sources were quoted by news agency PTI as saying. A case under various sections of the Indian Penal Code IPC was registered against Suraj Revanna on charges of sexually abusing the worker at his farmhouse on June 16. The Karnataka government transferred the case to the state's Crime Investigation Department. \"I won't react to anything. Let the (CID) do it (investigation). Who said don't (investigate)? I won't say anything on this. I have respect for the judiciary. I know what's happening in the state,\" HD Revanna told reporters. \"I have faith in God and the judiciary. I won't fear such conspiracies. I know what it is, time will decide,\" he said. Asked who was conspiring, HD Revanna said, \"I don't know, you (media) will have to tell -- who, what. I will leave it to you. I will face it. The judiciary is there. Suraj has gone (to the police). Everyone knows what all has happened in the past couple of days.\" Regarding his son's complaint, he said, \"I don't know what it is. Time will come. When the time comes, I will tell everything.\" Suraj Revanna was arrested when he was present at the Cyber Economic and Narcotics Crime (CEN) police station in Hassan in connection with a blackmail case filed by him and one of his aides, Shivakumar, against the victim. Suraj Revanna, 37, has rejected the charges against him and alleged that the victim filed a false complaint against him in a bid to extort Rs 5 crore from him. On Friday, police registered a case of extortion against the JD(S) worker on a complaint by Suraj Revanna's aide Shivakumar. Meanwhile, Union Minister and former Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy chose not to react to his nephew Suraj Revanna's case and said the law will take its own course. \"That issue, why do you ask me? It is not pertaining to me. It is not necessary to react to all those things. Law will take its own course. What do I have to do with it (case)?\" he said. Asking reporters not to discuss with him on the matter, Kumaraswamy said, \"Discuss with me on issues concerning the state. Why discuss with me about it. What is the need? Law will take its course. Why such cases? We will get to know in the days to come.\" Suraj Revanna's brother PrajwalRevanna is presently in police custody on charges of sexually assaulting women in viral videos allegedly featuring him. Prajwal Revanna, who lost the Lok Sabha elections from Hassan seat, was arrested upon his return from Germany on May 31. On a related note, HD Revanna and his wife Bhavani Revanna are out on bail. They were arrested for allegedly kidnapping and keeping a victim who claimed she was raped by Prajwal Revanna."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The DMK has accused the BJP of being responsible for the tragic deaths in the Kallakurichi hooch incident, claiming that the methanol used to produce the illicit liquor was sourced from Puducherry, a state ruled by the BJP-led alliance. A DMK leader called the incident a “planned conspiracy by Annamalai”. Over 50 people in Tamil Nadu’s Kallakurichi district died after consuming spurious liquor on June 18. In a press conference, DMK Organisational Secretary RS Bharathi squarely blamed BJP's Tamil Nadu president K Annamalai for the incident. Bharathi's allegations come in response to Annamalai's earlier demand for Chief Minister MK Stalin's resignation over the tragedy. Speaking to India Today TV, Annamalai had criticised MK Stalin, suggesting that the Chief Minister should introspect whether he should sit in the chair after what had happened. Addressing these remarks, Bharathi asserted, \"If anyone needs to resign, it’s their (BJP) ministers and the Chief Minister of Puducherry. The police are telling us that the raw materials came from there. The BJP is liable. They have done it. I’m calling this a planned conspiracy by Annamalai. This is related to Vikravandi election. I have doubts if it was done before elections.\" Bharathi further questioned whether BJP leaders and ministers were held accountable for incidents in the past. \"Had the Railway Minister resigned after the Darjeeling train accident? Did the Union Minister resign due to the conspiracies that have hit NEET? Did Narendra Modi resign in 2009 when 137 people died after drinking illicit liquor?\" questioned RS Bharathi. He also accused Annamalai of spreading false information regarding the incident, including the resignation of the district's Superintendent of Police. On June 18, several men, mostly daily wage labourers from Karunapuram in Kallakurichi district, allegedly consumed spurious liquor sold in packets and sachets. By night, many of them started experiencing symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach ache, and irritation in the eyes. A total of 53 people died in the incident, while dozens are still in critical condition. According to Chief Minister MK Stalin, the deaths were caused by the consumption of 'methanol mixed arrack'. Four persons were arrested in connection with the sale of the illicit liquor."

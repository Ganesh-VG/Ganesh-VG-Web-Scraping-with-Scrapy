    "article_content": "Listen to Story \"Pakistan is now a fait accompli, and it can never be undone,\" said the Islamic republic's founding father Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He couldn't have been farther from the truth. In two decades, Pakistan was to see the landmark National Assembly elections of 1970, which split the country into two. It was 1970, and Pakistan was going to hold its first 'real' election, based on universal suffrage and direct voting. They also had a new National Assembly building ready to convene business after it became an Islamic Republic in 1956, nine years after its Independence in 1947. Till then, Pakistan had seen seven Prime Ministers and two instances of martial law regimes. It was an election that not only shaped the destiny of Pakistan but also set the stage for the creation of a new country —Bangladesh. The nail-biting contest between Nawaz Sharif's party and Imran Khan-backed Independent candidates brings to mind the landmark election of 1970. With reports of violence, communication seizure and allegations of mismanagement , it is impossible not to draw parallels with the National Assembly elections of 1970. The 1970 election gave Pakistan a couple of options, like the 2024 election it looks to be giving now; to restore democracy or walk on the path of turmoil and instability, which it has always walked on. The 1970 National Assembly elections were fought under the shadow of Ayub Khan's martial law, which started in 1958, and the subsequent takeover of the reign of the country by General Yahya Khan in 1969. The 1970 elections were a fierce contest between two major democratic parties: the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, based in West Pakistan, and the Awami League, under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, based in East Pakistan. West Pakistan had 138 seats, while East Pakistan had 162 seats in the National Assembly, barring the reserved seats for women. While the Awami League fielded some candidates in West Pakistan, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto ignored East Pakistan and did not field any candidates there. The 1970 election results took both Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and President Yahya Khan by surprise. They hadn't budgeted for the massive win by the Awami League. The Awami League secured an absolute majority, winning 160 of the 162 seats, sweeping East Pakistan, while the Pakistan Peoples Party won 81 seats in Punjab and Sindh, out of the 138 seats. \"The 1970 elections were a free and fair one, but the Awami League was denied its right,\" Swedish political scientist Ishtiaq Ahmed said in a YouTube interview. The results were loud and clear, and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman emerged as the leader of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The victory of the Awami League and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was not just a political triumph; it was a resounding call for autonomy from the people of East Pakistan, who were discounted as inferiors in the eyes of the Punjabi and Sindhi ruling elites of West Pakistan. The Awami League had long campaigned for substantial autonomy for the eastern wing, which felt marginalised and economically exploited by the more dominant West Pakistan. “Over the years, West Pakistan behaved like a poorly raised, egotistical guest, devouring the best dishes and leaving nothing but scraps and leftovers for East Pakistan,” noted French journalist Paul Dreyfus. However, the landmark electoral mandate of 1970 did not translate into a smooth transition of power. The ruling regime in West Pakistan, backed by the military, and led by Yahya Khan, refused to recognise the right of the Awami League to form a government. Yahya Khan prevented Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from assuming power by indefinitely delaying the convening of the National Assembly. This denial of political legitimacy and the betrayal of the mandate of East Pakistan led to widespread civil disobedience in East Pakistan under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. \"West Pakistan never treated East Pakistan based on democratic principles,\" political scientist, Ishtiaq Ahmed said. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at the Race Course Ground, Dhaka, March,1971. (Image: Getty) Meanwhile, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman spoke at a gathering, asking all elected members of the Awami League from East Pakistan to pledge to uphold nothing less than the recognition of Bangladesh. “In East Pakistan Shaikh Mujibur Rahman, through his emotional and livid speeches, spoke about the injustices meted out to Bengalis since the inception of Pakistan,” reported Pakistani nwewspaper Dawn. The call for consciousness by Sheikh Mujib followed a brutal military crackdown that would eventually spiral into a full-scale conflict, drawing India and culminating in the birth of Bangladesh in 1971. The Pakistani Armed Forces launched the infamous 'Operation Searchlight', on March 24, 1971, to suppress the protests in East Pakistan. Tanks rolled on the streets of Dhaka and the Pakistani troops massacred students and intellectuals at Dhaka University, along with numerous civilians in various parts of the city. The two-month-long, bloody operation led to widespread killings, illegal arrests and destruction in the cities of then East Pakistan. The Pakistani operations in East Pakistan reportedly killed between 3,00,000 and 3 million civilians, prompting the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to call it a 'genocide'. On March 26, 1971, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared the Independence of Bangladesh through a telegram and subsequent radio transmissions. \"This may be my last message, from today Bangladesh is independent. I call upon the people of Bangladesh wherever you might be and with whatever you have, to resist the army of occupation to the last. Your fight must go on until the last soldier of the Pakistan occupation army is expelled from the soil of Bangladesh and final victory is achieved,\" proclaimed the 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, through the Telegram, which was later broadcast by his party men. The proclamation of Independence by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the crushing defeat of the Pakistani Armed Forces at the hands of the Indian Armed Forces made sure that Pakistan now lost more than half of its population and around 20% of the land area that it exploited economically, linguistically and culturally for many decades. The 1970 National Assembly elections, not only broke Pakistan into two but proved Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah wrong."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Chinese Army has outright refused to agree to any pullback of its troops and vehicles in the Gogra and Hot Springs friction points in eastern Ladakh. Fresh rigidity has brought to a grinding halt the positive momentum that began in February of this year with a significant troop pullback on both sides in the Pangong Tso sector. Top sources in the Indian Army's 14 Corps told India Today, \"The Chinese side appeared for the 11th round of talks on Friday with a predetermined decision to be totally inflexible.\" The 11th round of talks lasted for 13 hours and was the first following the most positive phase in the Ladakh standoff, which resulted in significant disengagement in the tense Pangong area. Still photos now in of the Chinese pullback in Ladakh’s Pangong sectors. Indian high-def cameras keeping tabs on every step. Each vehicle, bunker, tank & troop watched and validated in pullback. Tomorrow the crucial Phase 1 review between both sides. pic.twitter.com/94LOPga67g — Shiv Aroor (@ShivAroor) February 16, 2021 This is the same area in eastern Ladakh where Indian and Chinese troop groups were positioned just tens of meters from each other at some posts. The last round of military talks between India and China was held on February 20 of this year. Satellite imagery had also confirmed the depth and substance of the Chinese disengagement in the Fingers complex on the north shore of the giant Pangong Lake. However, China's amenability in the region has hit a major wall in discussions on the Gogra and Hot Springs areas where troop build-up on both sides remains significant. India had proposed a similar phased reduction of frontline troops and vehicles at these two posts, but China refused to budge. Reacting to the 11th round of talks, the Indian Army said in a statement on Saturday, \"Completion of disengagement in other areas would pave the way for two sides to consider de-escalation of forces and ensure full restoration of peace and tranquility and enable progress in bilateral relations.\" \"The two sides agreed that it was important to take guidance from the consensus of their leaders, continue their communication and dialogue and work towards a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues at the earliest,\" the statement went on to say. The statement was conspicuous by its lack of specifics on forward movement, an indicator of the stalemate at Friday's talks. China remains deployed in significant strength at Gogra, Hot Springs and Kongka La areas, with a large PLA logistics facility supporting troops there. Elements from a motorised infantry division, an artillery brigade and air-defence unit also remain deployed in the area. While there was brief and token pullback of troops in this part of eastern Ladakh after talks following the June 2020 clash in Galwan , the presence has now become a primary tactical problem area. China's inflexibility on Gogra and Hot Springs hasn't been unexpected - the Indian Army has accounted well for China's unpredictable posture at the talks- but the apparent duplicity in agreeing that disengagement is the way forward while not agreeing to actually do it has posed a fresh challenge to forward movement. Apart from the two sectors seeing a stalemate, a discussion on the larger Depsang plains issue is also pending."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The NDA alliance managed to scrape through in the recently-concluded polls by securing 293 seats, just 21 seats above the required majority mark of 272. Of this, the BJP won 240 seats, 63 less than their score in the previous Lok Sabha election. One of the major reasons for the dent in the alliance’s performance is the fall in rural votes. According to a post-poll survey by Axis My India (weighted to actual results), the BJP captured 35 per cent of the rural vote share, the largest by any party. However, it’s a slight decrease of 1 per cent compared to the 2019 election. The party’s allies maintained their rural vote share at 8 per cent, showing no change from the previous election. This means that out of every 100 voters, 43 voted for the NDA. While in itself, NDA’s performance is notable, it’s their rival, the INDIA bloc’s impressive show that tilted the scales against them. On the opposition front, the grand old party, Congress, saw a marginal rise in rural support. The INC’s rural vote share increased to 21 per cent, a hike of 2 per cent over the 2019 poll results. The major fillip for the party came from its allies as they witnessed a substantial boost in rural support, with their rural vote share rising by 13 per cent and reaching 21 per cent in the 2024 election compared to 2019. So, while only 29 voters out of 100 had chosen Congress and its allies in the last election, this time around, 42 of 100 voters in rural areas cast their ballot in favour of the INDIA bloc. The biggest jolt in rural areas was felt by regional parties, whose combined vote share fell by 14 percentage points to only 15 per cent in the 2024 elections. These include parties like the BSP in Uttar Pradesh, YSRCP in Andhra Pradesh, AIADMK and DMDK in Tamil Nadu, SAD in Punjab, and the BJD in Odisha. The sharp decrease suggests that rural voters tilted towards major alliances, seeking more stability and clearer policies."

Pictures of the crime scene, accessed by India Today TV, show multiple bruise marks on Renukaswamy's body with a missing ear and ruptured testicles. Renukaswamy, a 33-year-old auto driver, was found near a flyover in Bengaluru on June 9. According to the police, Renukaswamy, who was a fan of Darshan, was kidnapped and murdered by a gang at the actor's direction after he allegedly sent offensive messages on social media to actor Pavithra Gowda, who is rumoured to be Darshan's partner. According to Renukaswamy's autopsy report , he was attacked with wooden clubs and died \"due to shock and haemorrhage as a result of multiple blunt injuries sustained\". Pictures taken by the crime branch team, accessed by India Today TV, show black and blue marks on Renukswamy's back, arms and chest. The post-mortem report also indicated Renukaswamy was kicked and suffered a ruptured testicle. One of his ears was also missing, and his mouth was mutilated and broken. Darshan and Pavithra Gowda, along with 15 others, have been arrested by the police. According to the police, Renukaswamy had sent obscene messages to Pavithra Gowda, as he blamed her for souring Darshan's relationship with his wife. This allegedly enraged the actor, who then hired members of one of his fan clubs and paid them to kidnap Renukaswamy. Darshan also allegedly provided Rs 5 lakh each to two of the four accused men to take the blame for Renukaswamy's murder."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Ever since Trinamool Congress (TMC) Rajya Sabha MP Saket Gokhale took to his X social media handle on June 11 to declare that three of the newly-elected BJP MPs from West Bengal were in touch with his party, a series of interesting events have unfolded in the state. On June 18, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee met the BJP’s Rajya Sabha member Ananta Burman Maharaj aka Nagendra Roy at his residence in Coochbehar. Roy has been a vocal advocate of separate statehood for his community, but had extended support to the BJP camp ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, resulting in the victory of their candidate Nisith Pramanik. Pramanik was later inducted as a junior home minister under Amit Shah at the Centre. Roy himself was awarded with a Rajya Sabha berth last August—against the suggestions of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and many state unit leaders. In this Lok Sabha election, however, the TMC wrested the Coochbehar seat, and sources claim that Roy might have a hand in the results. Soon after his induction into the Rajya Sabha, Roy fell out with the BJP leadership. He publicly said he is not being given enough importance in the party. He alleged he was kept in the dark about the party’s activities and was not invited to crucial meetings. There were inner rumblings between Roy and Pramanik as to who will be more powerful in the politics of Coochbehar district. Shah himself had to intervene and call Roy to snub his ‘protests’. It is being said that since then, Roy has gradually stopped rallying behind Pramanik, though not publicly, leading to the latter’s defeat. “I do not belong to any party. I have not contacted the TMC or Mamata Banerjee. She called upon me as a courtesy visit,” Roy said after Mamata left. Sources said the chief minister congratulated the self-proclaimed Maharaj for his role in the polls. It was also reported that Roy complained that he is not being able to use his MP development funds due to administrative non-cooperation—a matter Mamata apparently promised to look into. On the other hand, the recent activities of the BJP’s Bishnupur MP Saumitra Khan have brought the spotlight on him as well. Recently, Khan was seen touching the feet of a local TMC leader as a show of respect. When asked, Khan told INDIA TODAY this was his ‘brand of politics’. “I am a three-time MP from Bishnupur. I maintain good relations with everyone, cutting across party lines, and this is why everyone love me,” he said. Khan won the 2024 Lok Sabha polls by a marginal lead of 5,567, defeating estranged wife and TMC candidate Sujata Mondal. He has lately been vocal about the poll debacle faced by the BJP. While holding organisational inabilities and sabotage as responsible for the results, he also heaped praises on TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee. Khan has said he will demand the payment of central dues towards Bengal under the NREGA and PMAY-G schemes. The cessation of these funds became a major poll plank for the TMC in the general elections. Khan believes the non-payment precipitated the BJP’s poll inundation. “I am not joining the TMC. The BJP has given me a lot, and I respect that,” Khan, however, clarified. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are transforming industries at an unprecedented pace. Several companies are leveraging these technologies to accelerate processes, enhance productivity, and create innovative solutions. India Today was at Imagine AI, in Austin, Texas where we spoke with Prince Kohli, CTO of Automation Anywhere, to explore how AI is revolutionising automation and the ways enterprises can deploy these advancements responsibly without compromising on their digital security. Is automation relevant when AI is in the picture? \"Automation uses AI to get better\", said Prince Kohli. \"It will always be complimentary\". He emphasised that AI serves as a powerful tool to understand and extract valuable information, which is then used to optimise automated processes. For example, in the banking sector, AI can analyse millions of transactions daily to identify anomalies, flag suspicious activities, and ensure compliance. This synergy between AI and automation enables tasks to be completed with higher productivity and accuracy than ever before. One significant advantage of AI in automation is its ability to reduce time-intensive processes. \"In drug discovery, what typically takes a decade can potentially be achieved in a year with AI,\" Kohli noted. This dramatic reduction in time is not just limited to pharmaceuticals but spans across various industries, enhancing efficiency and output. California-based Automation Anywhere provides a suite of easy-to-use tools designed to make AI integration seamless for enterprises. These tools are developed to be user-friendly while concealing the complexities of underlying technologies. Kohli highlighted the company's Co-Pilot feature, which was launched last year at the company’s annual Imagine event, and integrates with applications like Microsoft and Salesforce. \"We are trying to make sure that companies don’t have to understand the complexities of the process or the technology and you can talk to them,\" he said. This approach ensures that even non-technical users can harness the power of AI to drive productivity. Training and skill development are crucial for the effective deployment of AI tools. \"We allow people to create those tools and provide training on how to use them,\" Kohli mentioned. For developers, Automation Anywhere offers functionalities like prompt auto-tuning, enabling them to create models and set up guardrails effortlessly. This democratisation of AI tools allows for broader adoption and innovative use cases within organisations. Kohli shared several success stories from India, including some of the success stories it has delivered to its customers like Tata Sky, Indian Oil Corporation and more, on the tangible benefits of AI-enhanced automation. In contact centres, processes that used to take 6-8 minutes are now significantly faster due to AI's ability to pull relevant customer information instantly. \"When it’s an email, the AI can parse the data and provide a comprehensive answer to the query,\" Kohli said, highlighting how AI agents are evolving from basic support tools to intelligent assistants. Document automation is another area where AI is making a substantial impact. By understanding and processing documents quickly, AI accelerates processes like Know Your Customer (KYC) verifications, credit card applications, and house loans. This is particularly advantageous in a populous country like India, where resource management and efficiency are paramount. \"Manufacturing can also leverage AI automation,\" Kohli added, noting how AI can identify irregularities on assembly lines, improving quality control. While the benefits of AI are clear, responsible deployment is essential. Kohli stresses the importance of data privacy and compliance, especially in industries like healthcare and finance. Since many of these companies deal with private data of citizens, it’s imperative to deploy efficient data security solutions to ensure that none of the sensitive information is compromised. \"We allow data to stay inside their firewalls and provide guardrails to ensure data privacy. These companies also have control over how long their data stays in the server and where exactly the data is stored.” - Price Kohli, CTO, Automation Anywhere. The company is committed to enabling secure and compliant AI solutions, offering private and public cloud options with data masking and lifetime settings. The Indian government is also urged to invest in AI for national security, resource management, and fraud detection. Kohli believes that India can leverage AI to better citizens' lives by implementing robust data privacy laws and fostering a conducive environment for startups. \"India doesn’t have a choice and should look at these as a great opportunity to take the lead in policy-making,\" he mentioned. The integration of AI with automation is set to redefine industries and job roles. While concerns about job displacement exist, Kohli is optimistic about the future. \"The quality of work went up for everyone,\" he reflected on past technological shifts. AI and automation will automate the mundane aspects of jobs, allowing workers to focus on more complex and meaningful tasks. This will allow them to focus more on the creative and innovative aspects of the job. Skill development and a positive mindset towards AI are vital. Kohli advised, \"It’s more about a mental change and not a skill change.\" Embracing AI as an augmentation tool rather than a threat can unlock unprecedented opportunities for innovation and growth. To conclude, AI-enhanced automation is revolutionising how industries operate, offering faster, more efficient, and smarter solutions. With responsible deployment and a focus on skill development, enterprises can harness the full potential of these technologies, paving the way for a future of augmented work and enhanced productivity."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story England will return to the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, the venue where they registered a convincing win over the West Indies on Wednesday. South Africa, on the other hand, haven't played a T20I at this ground since May 2010, but they arrived at the back of a solid victory over the United States. The stage is perfectly set for their men's T20 World Cup clash in Gros Islet on Friday. South Africa remains unbeaten after five games, while England, having lost to Australia, faced a challenging situation chasing 109 in 10 overs in their rain-affected match against Scotland. Their recent victory over the USA by 18 runs has further solidified their status as strong contenders. The Proteas have demonstrated a balanced and effective strategy throughout the tournament, making this upcoming clash against England highly anticipated. Consider that England are more familiar with the conditions at the Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, which gives them an advantage going into Friday's match. However, South Africa have managed to overcome the challenges posed by the pitches in their earlier games in Nassau County and Arnos Vale. Now that they have found their rhythm, they will be a tough team to calm down. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats ST LUCIA WEATHER AND PITCH REPORT However, the weather could play a significant role in this electrifying contest. The forecast for the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in St Lucia indicates a temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, with the humidity making it feel like 36 degrees. The day is expected to be cloudy with a chance of thunderstorms in the morning, followed by a few thunderstorms in the afternoon. These weather conditions could potentially interrupt the match, leading to halts or pauses, which might affect the flow of the game. Historically, the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium has hosted 38 T20I games. Teams batting first have won 17 of these matches, while teams batting second have secured victory in 21 games. The average first innings total at the stadium is 144, while the average second innings total is 127. The highest-ever total at the stadium was recently set by the West Indies, who scored 218 against Afghanistan in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Defending champions England finally played like themselves for the first time in their Super 8 fixture against West Indies. In the match, England chased down 181 runs in just 17.3 overs, courtesy of a terrific effort from Phil Salt (87* off 47 balls). Another good sign for England is Jonny Bairstow coming back into form with back-to-back knocks against Scotland and West Indies. Jos Buttler's side will face South Africa in their second fixture against South Africa on Friday, 21 June. The match will be played at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, Gros Islet, St Lucia. This is expected to be a high-scoring game and will be played in hot and humid weather. England have traditionally not done well against South Africa. However, this could be very different as the Proteas have not grabbed a single convincing win in the tournament so far. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats The Aiden Markram-led side struggled with the bat in New York. It was expected, given the Nassau County pitch was a nightmare for the batters. South Africa had its bowling team do well in all of its matches. However, that faltered against the USA, as Anrich Nortje and Tabraiz Shamsi were smashed all around the park by USA's Andries Gous and Harmeet Singh. A sensational penultimate over from Kagiso Rabada saved the match for the Rainbow Nation and they would really need to buckle up if they want to get further ahead in the tournament. Both teams have one win each so far in the Super 8 stages. However, this match could essentially decide if England will make it to the semi-final stage of the tournament or not. A win for England will also bring them straight back as one of the teams who are potential favourites to win the tournament. Funny, how perception changes in a matter of just one week. England and South Africa have played 25 matches between themselves with both teams winning 12 matches each. One of the matches bore no results. In the men's T20 World Cup, the two teams have faced each other 6 times. South Africa have dominated the contest in ICC tournaments, winning 4 out of those 6 matches. There are a lot of questions about South Africa's top order. Some of those were allayed in their previous match against USA, when Quinton de Kock came out all guns blazing to hit a terrific knock of 74 runs. However, in that game, South Africa almost bottled a chance to win the game due to Tabraiz Shami's spell of 4-0-50-1. Anrich Nortje was at the receiving end as well, however, they managed to come out unscathed in the final over of the match, helping SA win by 18 runs . It is expected that South Africa will make at least one change based on their previous match. the playing XI might see Ottneil Baartman return in place of Tabraiz Shamsi. On the other hand, England just about managed to reach the Super 8 stages and after they managed to qualify, they flipped a switch. England hammered co-hosts West Indies in their first Super 8 fixture and will hope to continue their form. They might make one change, bringing in Mark Wood in place of Chris Jordan. The weather could play a significant role in this electrifying contest. The forecast for the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in St Lucia indicates a temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, with the humidity making it feel like 36 degrees. The day is expected to be cloudy with a chance of thunderstorms in the morning, followed by a few thunderstorms in the afternoon. These weather conditions could potentially interrupt the match, leading to halts or pauses, which might affect the flow of the game. The pitch is expected to have some runs on it. West Indies slammed 218 against Afghanistan in St Lucia and then were hammered by England on the same ground. South Africa: Quinton de Kock (wk), Reeza Hendricks, Aiden Markram (capt), Tristan Stubbs, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), David Miller, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Ottneil Baartman, Anrich Nortje England: Phil Salt, Jos Buttler (capt, wk), Moeen Ali, Jonny Bairstow, Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone Sam Curran, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood, Reece Topley"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The action will continue in the Super 8 stages of the T20 World Cup 2024 as co-hosts USA and West Indies will take on each other in Match 46 at Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados. Both teams are coming into the game having lost their respective first matches in the Super 8 and hence will face off in a must-win clash. West Indies suffered a crushing eight-wicket loss against the defending champions England in St Lucia which puts them in a precarious situation in the tournament. On the other hand, USA once again came agonisingly close of creating another upset as they almost chased down a massive score of 196 but eventually lost by 18 runs. T20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats Hence, both teams will be desperate to bounce back to winning ways in the upcoming must-win clash. However, ahead of the game, fans are curious to know whether there will be any weather interruptions during the much-awaited fixture. According to weather.com, there are slight chances of rain during the course of the game with 24% chance of precipitation. Cloud cover will remain throughout the course of the game but there won’t be many interruptions, hence fans can expect a full-fledged 40-over game. Meanwhile, the fixture is extremely crucial for both teams as one more loss will put them on the verge of being knocked out from the tournament. West Indies advanced to the Super 8 stage after a dominant run in Group C where they won all of their four fixtures. On the other hand, the USA has impressed everyone in the tournament so far with their fighting spirit against the big teams. They beat Pakistan in their second clash via a super over and later were involved in an intense battle against India. The Monank Patel-led further gave a major scare to South Africa in their first Super 8 clash before eventually losing against them. Hence, USA will be expected to give West Indies a run for their money in the upcoming fixture and may possibly register their second big win of the tournament. The upcoming clash is a highly anticipated affair for fans as both hosts of the tournament go head to head against each other."

If the service voter is at his hometown, the voter and their proxy can sign Form 13F before a notary or first class magistrate and then send it to the returning officer. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> You can vote using postal ballot only if you work for the military, the government or are on election duty and are posted outside your state; or you have been taken into custody as \"preventive detention\". EVMs expedite counting of votes, taking only a few hours for an entire constituency compared to weeks with paper ballots. This swift process minimizes tampering risks, enhancing electoral efficiency.For more information on EVM vs postal ballot , refer to this resource. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> An EVM or Electronic Voting Machine is an electronic device for recording of votes. It consists of two units - a control unit and a balloting unit. Since 2010, the Election Commission has been phasing in a third unit called the VVPAT or the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail. It allows voters to verify that their votes have been recorded correctly by printing a paper receipt. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> The Election Commission's technical experts committee, along with Bharat Electronics Ltd and Electronic Corporation of India Ltd, designed the EVM. These machines have two parts: a control unit and a balloting unit connected by a cable. The control unit is with the election official, and the balloting unit is in the voting compartment. Instead of a paper ballot, the official releases a digital ballot, and voters cast their votes by pressing a button on the balloting unit for their chosen candidate. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> The control unit can store the result in its memory until the data is deleted or cleared. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> No, once a button on the balloting unit is pressed for a candidate, the vote is recorded, and the machine locks it. Pressing the button again or any other button won't record additional votes, ensuring the 'one man, one vote' principle. The next vote can only be cast when the presiding officer or polling officer releases the ballot by pressing the ballot button. This is a clear advantage over the ballot paper system. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> According to the Election Commission, EVMs are secure and accurate. Despite occasional concerns over glitches, experts have said that EVMs are less susceptible to manipulation than traditional ballot boxes, making them vital for the large-scale and efficient conduct of elections in India. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> Advantages of EVMs include eliminating 'invalid votes' that were common with paper ballots. EVMs provide a more accurate reflection of voters' choices. They also save significant costs by doing away with the requirement of millions of ballot papers. EVMs make the counting process much quicker, with results declared within 3 to 5 hours compared to the conventional 30-40 hours. How to cast your vote using EVM <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> EVMs do not require electricity to run. EVMs run on an ordinary battery assembled by Bharat Electronics Limited/Electronics Corporation of India Limited. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> An EVM can record a maximum of 2,000 votes. In case of M2 EVMs (used during 2006-10), EVMs can cater to a maximum of 64 candidates, including NOTA. There is provision for 16 candidates in a balloting unit. If the total number of candidates exceeds 16, more balloting units can be attached (one per 16 candidates) up to a maximum of 64 candidates by connecting four balloting units. However, in case of M3 EVMs (used post 2013), EVMs can cater to a maximum of 384 candidates, including NOTA by connecting 24 balloting units. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> If an EVM at a polling station malfunctions, it is replaced with a new one. Votes recorded until the EVM malfunction is safely stored in the control unit's memory. Polling can resume without starting over. On counting day, votes from both control units are tallied for the polling station's final result. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) is a system linked with EVMs. It lets voters verify their votes by printing a slip with the candidate's details for 7 seconds, visible through a window. The slip is then cut and it falls into the sealed VVPAT drop box. VVPATs with EVMs were used for first time in a bye-election in the Noksen (ST) Assembly constituency of Nagaland. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> Only the authorised engineers of the EVM manufacturers, Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), perform the initial check of EVMs and VVPATs. This is done under the control of the District Election Officer, and under the supervision of deputy DEO and representatives of all political parties. The process is recorded on video. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> When a voter presses the 'blue button' next to their chosen candidate, a red light appears on that candidate's symbol, and a long beep sound is heard. This gives the voter both a visual and audio confirmation that their vote has been recorded correctly. Additionally, the VVPAT produces a paper slip for the voter to visually verify that their vote has indeed been correctly registered for their chosen candidate. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> Yes, there is a device called a 'Totalise' that can combine votes from up to 14 control units without showing the count for each candidate from a specific EVM at a polling station. Currently, this device is not in use because their technical aspects and related matters are under review, and there is also a court case ongoing over it. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> For more details you can visit election commission official website i.e. https://www.eci.gov.in/ <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> NOTA or \"None of the above\" is a voting option on EVMs that allows voters to reject every candidate in their constituency. It was introduced in October 2013 following a Supreme Court order. In the 2022 election, Bihar registered the highest NOTA votes at 2.48% followed by Gujarat at 1.8%. In the 2023 assembly polls to five states, Chhattisgarh recorded the maximum NOTA votes at 1.29 per cent. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> According to the Election Commission, even if the number of voters choosing NOTA is higher than the number of votes polled by any of the candidates, the candidate who has the largest number of votes has to be declared winner. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> The model code of conduct is a set of guidelines that candidates, political parties and governments must follow to keep elections fair. It is basically a set of dos and don'ts that regulates the conduct of political parties in the run-up to elections. These generally include restrictions on government announcements and freebies that can influence voters. The model code of conduct comes into effect as soon as the Election Commission announces poll dates. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> During Lok Sabha election, the code applies nationwide. For state assembly elections, the code applies to the entire state. In bye-elections, if the constituency is part of the state capital, metropolitan cities, or municipal corporations, the code is applicable only to that area. Otherwise, for all other cases, the Model Code of Conduct is enforced across the entire district covering the constituency having the bye-election. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> The model code of conduct does not have any statutory backing and thus is not admissible in the court of law. However, if violations fall under Representation of the People Act, 1951, they are punishable. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> No. Any official who meets the minister on his private visit to the constituency shall be guilty of misconduct under the relevant service rules. If he happens to be an official mentioned in Section 129 (1) of the Representation of People Act, 1951, he shall also be additionally considered to have violated the statutory provisions of that section and liable for penal action. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> As per the Model Code of Conduct, a minister cannot use an official government vehicle or maintenance allowance for election or campaigning purposes. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> When MCC is in place, ministers cannot announce any financial grants or start any new projects. If a work has actually started in the field, that can be continued. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> No. Fresh release of funds under MPs/MLAs/MLCs Local Area Development Fund of any scheme shall not be made in any area where election is in progress. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> Bellwether seats are those that have historically voted for the winning party and give an indication of the poll outcome. Early trends on counting day in these seats often act as a surest indication of what the outcome will be. <!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--> In the 2019 election, BJP secured a majority on its own, winning 303 seats. The BJP bettered its performance five years ago when it won 282 seats in the 2014 polls. Altogether, NDA won 353 Lok Sabha seats, 17 more than it won in 2014."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story In 2024, YouTube is the go-to place for many people for not just fun videos, but information as well. But if there is one thing that none of us like while watching a YouTube video- it is the ads. And to get rid of these ads, people can at times resort to all sorts of measures- even if it means purchasing the streaming service's premium subscription by changing their location using a VPN. And now, YouTube is reportedly cracking down on such users and banning their subscriptions. Didn't really get that? Let's dive deep. For the unversed, YouTube Premium is a subscription service that offers ad-free content and additional perks to users. In India, the three-month plan is priced at Rs 399, the one-month plan at Rs 129, and the twelve-month plan at Rs 1,290. However, in other countries, the amount varies. In some, this subscription is cheaper while in others, it is costlier. Now, a common practice that was being carried out by users was using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to switch their location to a country where YouTube Premium was cheaper. For instance, while YouTube Premium costs USD 13.99 per month in the US for ad-free videos, YouTube Music, and offline downloads. Meanwhile, the subscription is priced at just USD 1.05 per month (869 ARS) in Argentina. So, a user living in US could use a VPN to purchase a YouTube Premium subscription at the price that it is offered in Argentina. However, YouTube now appears to be targeting subscribers who use this tactic without actually residing in those countries. Several users on Reddit have reported that their subscriptions were automatically cancelled. Users also reported speaking to the YouTube team and being told that their subscription has been cancelled as they \"moved\" to a different location. \"Confirmed it's a crackdown on cheap VPN subscriptions. Have just spoken to customer service who stated that as I \"moved\" to a different location from the one I signed up at (Ukraine but UK based), the service has been cancelled until I sign up with a UK card and address. From £2.30 a month to £12.99. Yikes,\" a user wrote. \"Mine got cancelled too. I guess they are cracking down on the cheap VPN subscriptions,\" another user added. In a statement to The Verge, YouTube spokesperson Paul Pennington confirmed that the company has “systems in place” to verify the locations of its users. Pennington said, “In instances where the signup country does not match where the user is accessing YouTube, we’re asking members to update their billing information to their current country of residence.” However, Pennington did not clarify if YouTube has begun automatically cancelling subscriptions that use altered locations."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Just a few more weeks to wait before Apple hosts its next big event of the year- the fall event unveiling the iPhone 16 series. Expected to release in September 2024, rumours and speculations around the new gen Apple iPhones are already around the internet giving a sneak peak on what we can expect. The upcoming iPhone 16 series is speculated to bring some significant upgrades, with notable changes in display size, camera technology, and several new functionalities that promise to elevate user experience. And of course upping the entire experience with the power of the new OS- iOS 18 and Apple intelligence bringing customisation options, AI features and more. Let's take a detailed look at everything we know so far about the upcoming iPhone 16 series so far: One of the most anticipated changes in the iPhone 16 series is said to be the increase in display size for the Pro models. The iPhone 16 Pro is expected to feature a 6.3-inch display, while the Pro Max will boast a 6.9-inch screen, making them the largest iPhones to date. This size increment if true will mark the first significant display upgrade for iPhones in several years. Although the standard iPhone 16 and 16 Plus will retain the 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch sizes, respectively, but will benefit from thinner bezels, enhancing the overall screen real estate. Moreover, Apple is rumoured to adopt new OLED materials and possibly introduce MicroLED technology, which promises improved brightness and colour accuracy while being more power-efficient. This will offer users a more immersive and visually stunning display experience. The iPhone 16 series is also expected to introduce significant camera upgrades. The Pro models will likely feature an enhanced 48MP main camera with a larger sensor, improving low-light performance and image quality. Additionally, the Pro models may also see an upgraded 48MP ultrawide camera, allowing for high-resolution shots at the widest magnification level. The new iPhone series is also said to reintroduce the vertical camera arrangement which saw in iPhone X and 11 on the standard models, along with a redesigned camera bump in an effort to support Spatial Video recording for Apple's Vision Pro headset. This feature, along with a rumoured Tetraprism 5x optical zoom lens on the Pro models, likely to offer iPhone 16 users better zoom capabilities and enhance overall mobile photography experience. While the iPhone 16 series is rumoured to largely resemble its predecessors in terms of overall design, several subtle tweaks are anticipated. Apart from the vertical camera bump in standard iPhone 16 models, all models are expected to feature the new \"Capture Button,\" designed for taking photos and videos with ease, mimicking the functionality of a traditional camera shutter button. According to reports this new button will be pressure-sensitive, allowing for focusing and capturing images with varying degrees of pressure. Apple is also expected to bring the \"Action Button,\" introduced in the iPhone 15 Pro, across all iPhone 16 models. This button is likely to replace the mute switch, and will allow users the option for customisation to perform various tasks, such as activating the flashlight, launching the camera, or toggling silent mode. Under the hood, the iPhone 16 series is expected to be powered by the A18 or A17 Pro chip, depending on the model, with the Pro variants receiving the more powerful version. This new chip, will be built on the latest 3-nanometer node, will likely bring improvements in efficiency and performance, making multitasking smoother and more efficient. An upgrade to 8GB of RAM and default storage starting at 256GB are also on the cards, for more space and speed for all user needs. The new iPhones will also be said to support Wi-Fi 6E, offering faster and more reliable internet connectivity. Some rumours also suggest the Pro models might be equipped with Wi-Fi 7, further enhancing internet speeds and stability. Battery life improvements are another key focus for the iPhone 16 series. Leaks suggest that the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max will feature larger batteries, potentially offering over 30 hours of battery life. This would be a significant leap from the current all-day battery life promise of the iPhone 15 series. Additionally, Apple is reportedly exploring new ways to manage heat dispersion, addressing concerns raised by overheating issues in previous models. While exact pricing details are not yet confirmed, reports suggest that the base model will start around $799, with the Pro models priced between $1,000 and $1,100. Higher storage variants could add a few hundred dollars to these prices. Notably in India the iPhone 15 series was launched at a starting price of Rs 79,900."

    "article_content": "The Pixel 7 series is now available for purchase in India and its price starts from Rs 59,999. The Pro model will cost you Rs 84,999 in the country. Interested buyers can get it via Flipkart. The Pixel 7 series comes with the same old design that we saw on the previous models. It has a glass back, which makes it look premium. One will see the usual punch-hole display on the front. The standard model has a dual rear camera setup and the Pro variant packs three sensors at the rear panel. The new Google Pixel 7 has a smaller 6.32-inch display that operates at full-HD+ resolution. Both the devices have an OLED panel, but the regular version’s screen has support for only 90Hz refresh rate. The premium version comes with a bigger 6.7-inch LTPO OLED display with support for 120Hz refresh rate. The screen has Quad-HD resolution for better and sharper results. The Google Pixel 7 features a dual rear camera setup, including a 50-megapixel primary sensor and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide-angle sensor. The Pro model has the same camera setup, but this one also features an additional 48-megapixel telephoto sensor with support for 30x Super Resolution Zoom and 5x optical zoom. On the front, one will find a 10.8-megapixel camera on the front. The new Pixel phones draw power from Google's next-generation Tensor chipsets, which can offer smooth general performance. The high-end games are playable on both phones. The Pixel 7 series is also IP68-rated for dust and water resistance. The devices lack a headphone jack, which is not surprising considering most of the premium phones have stopped offering it. The models are outfitted with stereo speakers. The Pixel 7 ships with a 4,270mAh battery, whereas the Pixel 7 Pro packs a slightly bigger 4,926mAh unit under the hood. The company has provided support for 30W wired charging as well as wireless charging support. Google is claiming that users will get up to 72 hours of battery life if they use the phone’s Extreme Battery Saver mode.

Customers have the option to buy different-coloured bands and tweak the style.

The LTE variant lets users make a call and send messages directly from the watch. Sadly, the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro won't work with an iPhone. Thanks to its bigger size, it includes a big battery. The watch can last 36 hours with AoD on. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro is powered by a dual-core processor paired with 1.5GB RAM + 16GB internal storage."

    "article_content": "The Redmi Note 12 Pro+ seemingly has a pretty vibrant and attractive display. The colors really pop out and the content consumption on this phone makes for a better experience. The image is not able to portray the goodness of this Redmi phone, which is why I would suggest users check it out in the offline market when it becomes available for purchase. The panel has support for 120Hz refresh rate for a smoother scrolling experience. You get the standard punch-hole display design on the front and a triple camera setup at the back. The company is vouching that the Redmi Note 12 Pro+ will offer a great camera experience to users. The device does seem to have a good enough camera, as per our initial testing. The triple rear camera setup includes a 50-megapixel Sony IM766 sensor with OIS support, similar to the Nothing Phone (1) smartphone. If you want to know about the real-world camera experience of the latest Redmi phone, then stay tuned to India Today Tech as we will soon be publishing our review. The device is pretty bulky, which is something that you can make out from the image as well. The 5G phone doesn't have a slim design, but looks pretty attractive. The white color variant of the Redmi Note 12 Pro+ looks classier than the Blue version. The 5G phone has a good set of speakers that can get pretty loud and people will enjoy binge-watching on this device. The speakers have support for Dolby Atmos too. This one even has a 3.5mm jack, which is something that some of the companies have stopped offering it for a long time now. It is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 1080 SoC. We are still testing the performance of the Redmi Note 12 Pro+, so we can't talk much about it. But, so far I can say that the buyers of this Redmi phone won't be disappointed in this area. The handset is running on Android 12 OS, which is a bit surprising considering Android OS 13 is already out. The company is promising to offer two years of Android OS upgrades, which means that users will be able to experience Android 14 OS too with this smartphone. The user interface seems a bit cluttered and people will find some unnecessary third-party apps on this mid-range 5G phone. It would have been great if the company had provided a more clean UI out of the box. It ships with the company's MIUI 13 custom skin. It is unknown when this phone will get the latest MIUI 14 software. The Redmi Note 12 Pro+ comes with a 5,000mAh battery and the company has provided support for 67W fast charging. Xiaomi is claiming that the bundled charger can offer a day’s usage with just 15 minutes of charging. We will test this claim and talk more about the phone’s battery life in our review, which will be out soon. While the price is yet to be revealed, we expect the company to offer the Redmi Note 12 Pro+ at around Rs 25,000 in India. Its predecessor, Redmi Note 11 Pro+, was launched for Rs 19,999. The new version has better specifications, so expect to see a big price increase. The device will launch on January 5, and the details about the redmi Note 12 Pro+ will be revealed on the same day."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story e-Chunav, India Today's online poll that was conducted to gauge the voter's mood ahead of the Lok Sabha election results on June 4, saw an overwhelming 73 per cent of the participants backing the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA for a third straight term. The opposition INDIA bloc received around 23 per cent of the nearly 1.3 lakh votes cast on e-Chunav. Around four per cent of the votes went to Others. In terms of seats, the survey revealed the NDA is likely to get 397 seats, narrowly missing out on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's '400 paar' dream. INDIA is projected to win 121 seats. To calculate e-Chunav's seat projections, we converted the vote share percentage in a particular state into the corresponding percentage of Lok Sabha seats for that state. It's important to note that e-Chunav, an online poll, may not entirely reflect the entire nation's mood as only around 50 per cent people in India use the Internet. The e-Chunav, which follows a 'one number, one vote' format, was opened on April 19 as India voted in the first phase and was closed on June 1 with the completion of the seventh phase. Users had to choose their respective states and then vote for the party of their choice. To avoid duplication, users were allowed to vote only once through their mobile number and the votes were kept confidential. The e-Chunav result shows massive support in favour of the BJP in the Hindi heartland states as well as the western region. The survey also shows that the BJP has received the maximum number of votes from respondents in states like Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. The party has historically not fared well in the southern states. The survey, however, shows a wave in favour of the INDIA bloc in the northeast region, considered a stronghold of the BJP. The Congress received the maximum number of votes in ethnic strife-torn Manipur as well as Mizoram and Nagaland. The results show a close fight in Arunachal Pradesh even though most have voted in favour of the BJP in Assam. The picture, however, will only be clear on June 4, when the votes will be counted. The first e-Chunav was held a few months before the 2014 Lok Sabha election, and it correctly predicted the outcome of the polls. The BJP-led NDA came to power winning 336 seats, decimating the Congress-led UPA in 2014. In the 2019 general election, the India Today e-Chunav's prediction was yet again close to the actual result as the NDA won 353 seats while the Opposition alliance's tally stood at 91. UTTAR PRADESH In the key battleground state of Uttar Pradesh, e-chunav results show a projection of 57 seats for the NDA, a marginal dip from its tally in 2019. It has given 20 seats to INDIA. The India Today-Axis My India exit poll predicted 64–67 seats for the NDA and 8–12 seats for the INDIA bloc. ABP-CVoter and Today's Chanakya have forecast 62–66 seats and 68 seats for NDA respectively. BIHAR The NDA is also likely to see a dip in seat numbers in Bihar as per the e-chunav projection. It has projected 29 seats for the NDA, with nearly 73% vote share. For INDIA, it has projected 9 seats, with a 22% vote share. The India Today-Axis My India exit poll forecast 29–33 seats for the NDA, which comprises the BJP, JD(U), and Chirag Paswan's LJP. While CVoter said the BJP is likely to win 34–38 seats, Chanakya predicted 36 seats. RAJASTHAN The desert state of Rajasthan may see the BJP bag 18 of the total 26 seats, with a 71% vote share, as per the projection by e-chunav. It has projected six seats for the INDIA bloc, with 24% share of the total votes. Other pollsters, however, have forecast a higher number of seats for the BJP, which recently upstaged the Congress in the Assembly polls. The India Today-Axis My India exit poll predicted 16–19 seats for the NDA, while giving 5–7 seats to INDIA. CVoter and Chanakya predicted 21-23 and 22 seats for the NDA. DELHI The NDA is likely to fall short of a complete sweep again in the national capital. e-Chunav has projected six of the seven seats for the BJP in Delhi and one for the AAP-Congress alliance. Most other exit polls have predicted a similar scenario. The India Today-Axis My India exit poll forecast 6–7 seats for the BJP, while CVoter has given anywhere between 4–6 seats to the ruling party. WEST BENGAL West Bengal, which saw a campaign blitzkrieg by PM Modi and politics over protests at Sandeshkhali, is likely to see a saffron wave. e-Chunav has projected 34 of the 42 seats in favour of the BJP with a vote share of nearly 81%. It has projected just 5 seats for the ruling Trinamool Congress and 3 seats for Congress. Other pollsters have projected anywhere between 24–27 seats for the NDA, including CVoter and Chanakya. The India Today-Axis My India exit poll predicted 26–31 seats for the NDA and 11-14 for the TMC. GUJARAT The BJP is likely to maintain its grip on its bastion Gujarat. e-Chunav has projected a minor dip in seats for the NDA, giving it 22 of the 26 seats. It has projected 4 seats for the INDIA alliance. Most pollsters have predicted a clean sweep by the BJP in Gujarat. The India Today-Axis My India exit poll forecast 25–26 seats for the BJP. The INDIA bloc may at best win one seat. KARNATAKA Despite losing the state elections last year, the NDA's fortunes in Karnataka in the Lok Sabha polls is not likely to see a dent. e-Chunav has projected 23 seats for NDA, with a vote share of 82%. It has given 5 seats to INDIA. The India Today-Axis My India exit poll predicted 23–25 seats for the NDA in Karnataka and 3-5 seats for the Congress. CVoter and Chanakya have also projected anywhere between 23–25 seats for the NDA. MAHARASHTRA The key battleground of Maharashtra is also likely to see a major chunk of the seats go to the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance. e-Chunav has projected 33 of the 48 seats for the NDA. It has given 13 seats to INDIA, which comprises Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena faction and Sharad Pawar's NCP. The Axis My India exit poll predicted 28-32 of 48 seats in Maharashtra for the NDA alliance and 16-20 for INDIA bloc. As per the vote share prediction by Axis My India exit poll, the NDA is likely to bag 46% of the votes. ODISHA e-Chunav data showcases a twist in Odisha, with the NDA projected to win 16 of the 21 seats in the bastion of BJD's Naveen Patnaik. The BJD is projected to get just three seats. The Axis My India exit poll has predicted 18–20 seats for the BJP. The exit poll has given anywhere between 0–2 seats for the BJD. Congress may likely bag 0–1 seats. The forecast also matches the predictions of other pollsters. CVoter and Chanakya have given 16–19 seats to the NDA. TAMIL NADU A keenly watched state, Tamil Nadu has been predicted by most pollsters to vote for INDIA. However, eChunav has projected the NDA to win 27 seats in the state that has been the key focus of PM Modi. The DMK, e-Chunav has projected, may bag just 10 seats. The Axis My India exit poll has given 33–37 seats to the DMK-Congress alliance while predicting 2–4 seats for BJP. In the 2019 polls, the BJP had drawn a blank in the state. TELANGANA The BJP went all out in Telangana, and it seems to have paid dividends as per the e-Chunav results. e-Chunav has projected an overwhelming 13 of the 17 seats for the BJP in the state that was recently won by the Congress in the Assembly polls. It has given just 3 seats to Congress and nil to the BRS. Other pollsters, while predicting gains for the NDA, gave anywhere between 7–9 seats to the BJP-led alliance. Chanakya forecast 12 seats for the NDA while the Axis My India exit poll predicted 11–12 seats for it. UTTARAKHAND The Himalayan state of Uttarakhand is likely to see another clean sweep by the BJP if exit polls are to be believed. e-Chunav has projected 4 of the 5 seats for the BJP, while giving one to the Congress. The Axis My India exit poll, Chanakya and CVoter have all forecast a 5-0 result in favour of the BJP in Uttarakhand. On Saturday, exit polls predicted a hat-trick for the BJP , with Prime Minister Narendra Modi likely to return to power for a historic third term. Most pollsters said the NDA was likely to surpass its 2019 tally of 353 seats and get anywhere between 350–380 seats. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP won 303 seats, while the Congress was reduced to 53 seats and its allies to 38. The India Today-Axis My India poll predicted 361–401 seats for the NDA, and 131–166 seats for INDIA. Chanakya predicted a much higher tally for the NDA, giving 335 seats to the BJP and 400 to the NDA, with a margin of 15 seats either way. PM Modi had set a target of 370 seats for the BJP and 400 for the NDA."

    "article_content": "In March 2021, Xiaomi had announced its entry in the electric vehicle market. Tech enthusiasts have been quite intrigued by reports of the car in the making and have been speculating about its appearance and speculations for a long time. Now, we finally have pictures of how the car would look like and some people on Twitter are calling it a mix of Tesla and Porsche. The official first pictures of the car, called SU7, have been shared online. The images were first circulated by a Chinese government regulatory agency. The car, as per reports, will come in three versions, the SU7, SU7 Pro, and SU7 Max. Reports suggest that production of the SU7 has been scheduled for December 2023. In February 2024, the vehicles might even start getting delivered. However, this information should be taken with a pinch of salt as Xiaomi hasn’t officially given a date when the vehicles would be made available on road. Xiaomi has also applied for a sales license in China, signalling its serious commitment to the electric car sector."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story YouTube is bringing a lot of new changes to its platform to make it more engaging and focus on user privacy. One of the changes is bringing an option for Apple device users to give consent on sharing location if they want to see more personalised videos. The move is in line to comply with Apple's privacy policies and deliver more personalised advertising on the platform, aligning with Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework introduced with iOS 14.5. Apple's ATT policy, enforced since 2021, requires app developers to obtain explicit consent from users before tracking their activities across other companies' apps and websites. This change fundamentally altered how digital advertising works on Apple devices, emphasising user privacy and control over data sharing. In response, Google, like many other companies, modified its tracking practices to avoid displaying the ATT prompt by discontinuing certain tracking methods such as Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA). However, now YouTube is now taking a different approach. Soon it will show users of YouTube on iOS devices a one-time prompt asking for permission to track their activity across other apps and websites. The prompt will offer two options. First will be an 'Allow' option. Users who choose this option will enable YouTube to link their in-app activity with activity from non-Google apps and websites. This will help the platform in providing more personalised ads and better ad measurement. If selected this choice of the user will be applied across all users of the YouTube app on the device where the setting is enabled. Second will be an option of 'Ask App Not to Track'. Selecting this option will restrict YouTube from linking app activity with that from non-Google apps and websites, resulting in less personalised and potentially more repetitive ads. Notably, This new prompt will not appear for YouTube Premium subscribers or users with child accounts on YouTube. YouTube will also allow users to change their choice by navigating to iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking. YouTube further notes that \"This setting does not affect the linking of activity on other Google apps (iOS and non-iOS) and websites with activity from non-Google apps and websites. This setting also does not affect use of activity from the YouTube iOS app and other Google apps and websites to personalise ads, depending on your Google personalised ads choice.\" The new options are in line with YouTube's ongoing efforts to balance user privacy with the need for effective advertising, aiming to enhance user experience while supporting content creators through better ad performance metrics. \"Starting soon, YouTube users on iPhone and iPad devices can choose to opt into more personalised advertising, in line with Apple's App Tracking Transparency policy. We're confident that this will help us provide a high-quality, helpful ads experience for users, while also benefiting creators. YouTube users that choose to opt-in can turn this off at any time,\"said a YouTube spokesperson to 9 to 5 Google."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The OnePlus Nord 3 is one of the popular phones from OnePlus that was launched last year in July. While people are waiting for the company to launch the upgraded version that goes well with 2024 mid-range phones, the price of the older model is going down with time. The OnePlus Nord 3 is selling under Rs 20,000 during Amazon Monsoon Mobile Mania sale, which is quite surprising because the device was announced at Rs 33,999. This is a great deal because of the solid performance that users will get in the lower price segment compared to other phones under Rs 20,000. Interestingly, the brand is gearing up to launch a new phone in the same price range, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite. This will make its debut on June 24 and is expected to be priced at around Rs 20,000 with a few upgrades in certain areas, as suggested by leaks. Now, this OnePlus Nord 3 deal will likely confuse people in terms of which phone they should buy. So, the new phone will likely face direct competition from the company's own Nord device. At the moment, OnePlus hasn't revealed the name of the chipset that will be powering the Nord CE 4 Lite. Hence, we can't comment on the performance. It is tipped to pack Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC and if this turns out to be true, then the OnePlus Nord 3 would be a better option, considering it features a superior MediaTek Dimensity 9000 chip under the hood. We will have to wait to get more clarity on this. For now, the OnePlus Nord 3 is available with a starting price of Rs 19,998 on Amazon. This price is for the 8GB RAM + 128GB storage. There is also an additional 10 percent discount on select cards. To recall, this device was made available last year at Rs 33,999, something that we have also mentioned above. The deal is available during Amazon Monsoon Mobile Mania sale, which is already live and will continue until June 25. The OnePlus Nord 3 comes with a 6.74-inch AMOLED FHD+ display with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus protection. The panel operates at 120Hz refresh rate. It packs a 5,000mAh with 80W fast charging tech. At the back, there is a 50MP main camera with Sony IMX890 with OIS, an 8MP ultrawide camera with Sony IMX355 sensor and a 2MP macro camera."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story When iQOO 12 made its debut in November last year, the phone received some great reviews. It was praised for its speed, camera performance as well as big battery life. However, its successor, the iQOO 13, is expected to be even better. The phone, like its predecessor, is expected to launch in November this year. Even though were are a couple of months away from the launch, details about its design, chipset, battery and camera have already been leaked online. In addition to this, there might not be a Pro variant alongside the standard model this time. Leaks have claimed that the iQOO 13 will be a major upgrade over the iQOO 12. For the unversed, the iQOO 12 came with a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate and an optical in-display fingerprint sensor. The device ran on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset and came with 16 GB of RAM and 1 TB of storage. Battery wise, the iQOO 12 boasted a 5,000mAh battery with 120W fast charging. Now that the iQOO 13 is expected to be a massive upgrade over the iQOO 12, let us take a look at what the phone could offer. According to tipster Digital Chat Station, the iQOO 13 is rumoured to feature a flat OLED panel with a 2K resolution, a notable enhancement from the 1.5K resolution AMOLED display found on the iQOO 12. Despite earlier rumours suggesting a curved display, it seems the new model will retain a flat design. The device will reportedly come with a single-point ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint sensor, offering improved security and usability. Under the hood, the iQOO 13 is expected to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset. This upcoming processor is also slated to appear in other flagship models like the OnePlus 13 and Xiaomi 15. Accompanying the powerful chipset could be up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of internal storage. One of the significant upgrades in the iQOO 13 could be its battery capacity, which is rumoured to be a massive 6,000 mAh. This is a significant increase from the 5,000 mAh battery in the iQOO 12. The charging capabilities are also expected to see an improvement, with some reports suggesting 100W fast charging, though there is some conflicting information about whether it might support 120W fast charging. Additionally, the iQOO 13 is likely to feature 50W wireless charging, a feature absent in its predecessor. There might be some good news in store for photography lovers as well. The phone could come with a robust camera setup. The iQOO 13 is speculated to have a triple-camera system with three 50-megapixel sensors, including a main sensor, an ultrawide lens, and a 3x periscope telephoto camera. This configuration mirrors the setup found in the iQOO 12, although the telephoto lens in the previous model was a 64-megapixel sensor. For gamers, the iQOO 13 is expected to include an oversized x-axis linear motor, enhancing haptic feedback and overall gaming performance. The device is also expected to come with an IP68 rating, making it resistant to water and dust, which is an upgrade from the IP64 rating of the iQOO 12."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Free keyboard cover Portable Good pricing Long battery life Keyboard isn’t sturdy Laptop wobbles on kickstand Average camera Honor recently made a comeback to the Indian market with the launch of its Honor x9b smartphone, which was followed by the launch of the Honor Pad 9 tablet. While the Honor x9b is a little underwhelming for a comeback phone, the Honor Pad 9 doesn’t seem to be getting its due credit that it deserves. I have been using the Honor Pad 9 for a couple of months and I think for its price –– Rs 22,999 with offer –– the tablet might be one of the best options available in the price segment. And if you are someone who is looking for a good Android alternative for an iPad that is also affordable, the Honor Tab 9 is the most sensible choice. One of the biggest attractions of the Honor Tab 9 is that on a sub-Rs 25,000 budget, you not only get a well-performing tablet, you also get a free Bluetooth keyboard with it, which is usually sold separately by most companies, or it is bundled in the more expensive models. For instance, OnePlus also has the OnePlus Pad Go that is priced almost similarly at Rs 23,999 but if you want to get a keyboard with it, you have to pay another Rs 1,399. I believe the bundling of the keyboard with the Honor Pad 9 really sweetens the deal. Before we get into the details about the Honor Pad 9, let’s quickly go through the basics of what the device is made of. The Honor Pad 9 has an impressive 12.1-inch display that offers a resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels, resulting in sharp visuals with a pixel density of 249 PPI. Powered by the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 Mobile Platform, the tablet ensures smooth performance with its octa-core processor. It includes four Cortex-A78 cores clocked at 2.2GHz and four Cortex-A55 cores clocked at 1.8GHz, balancing power efficiency and high-performance computing. The Adreno 710 GPU supports seamless graphics rendering for gaming and multimedia applications. In terms of photography, the Honor Pad 9 features an 8-megapixel front camera with an f/2.2 aperture for clear selfies and a 13-megapixel rear camera with an f/2.0 aperture and autofocus for sharp images and videos. It offers 8GB RAM and storage options of 128GB or 256GB, which can be expanded up to 1TB with a memory card, providing ample space for large files, media, and applications. Honor Pad 9 comes bundled with a free Bluetooth keyboard The Honor Pad 9 is probably one of the best Android tablets I have used in this price segment. I carried it around with me on a bunch of trips on both domestic and international routes. I was using it to get some basic work done. I prepared two Excel sheets on it, and I wrote 2-3 reviews on the tablet, and I watched a bunch of shows and movies on it. The tablet never gave me any issues in terms of multitasking or in its general performance. The tablet uses an IPS display that provides wide viewing angles and vibrant colours. I especially love that it’s a huge 12.1-inch display. The tablet features a brightness level of 500 nits and a contrast ratio of 1500:1, that ensures clear and bright visuals in various lighting conditions, including under direct sunlight. I have used the tablet in a well-lit office, in my low-lit bedroom, at an outdoor seating in a café, and in the indescribable lighting of an airport, and I never faced any legibility issue. Carrying the tab around is also pretty easy. The tablet itself doesn’t weigh much –– 555g. You can easily move around with the tab in your hand or a backpack. When you stick on the keyboard, that does add a little weight and a bit of bulk, but the overall weight still remains manageable. It feels like a slightly heavier book to be honest. The Honor Smart Bluetooth keyboard Since I mentioned watching a lot of videos and shows on the tablet, I also want to talk about the audio output of the tablet. The Honor Pad 9 uses eight speakers and a large sound cavity, delivering an immersive sound quality. The audio experience is dynamic and engaging. You only face a little issue when you blast the volume to full. That’s when you start to hear noise in the audio output. I honestly didn’t test out the camera of the Honor Pad 9 much, especially the rear one. I did click a picture here and there, and I think that’s how a tablet’s rear camera really ends up being used. For that purpose, the camera gets the work done. The front camera is also nothing special. Unless you are sitting in a well-lit room, you will not get a very good output during your video calls. All the experience of the Honor Pad 9 is well-supported by its battery. It has an 8,300mAh battery that is easily able to last a day and a half. I watched a whole season of Modern Family on the tablet in a go and I had still not exhausted the battery. The only downside is that despite a 35W fast charging adapter that comes with it, the tablet takes a while to charge. It takes a little over 2 hours to charge to full. What’s a little more annoying is that you have to charge the keyboard separately. So if you are in a hurry, it’s a hard choice you have to make, or plug both the tablet and the keyboard to separate chargers simultaneously. It’s not a pretty sight. Since we are talking about the keyboard. The Honor Pad 9 comes with a free Bluetooth keyboard, which is called the Smart Bluetooth keyboard. It has a toggle button on the right that lets you connect and disconnect from the keyboard easily. That also allows you to avoid any mistouches if you aren’t using the keyboard. The smart keyboard does not have any trackpad, so you have to use the display’s touch for the navigation, which you can’t do using the keys. Both the tab and the keyboard have separate Type-C charging points. The keyboard also has a toggle that helps you easily connect and disconnect it to the tablet. While the keyboard itself is a great accessory, especially at this price point, it has some flaws. The keys on it have a decent amount of travel but typing too vigorously on it makes the tablet wobble. So, you have to be gentle with typing. Even touching the tab screen while its is docked on the keyboard make the whole pad wobble, which is because the kickstand mechanism isn't very stable. Overall, though, the keyboard’s drawbacks aren’t exactly dealbreakers. It isn’t perfect, but it’s good, it gets the job done, it looks great, and at the top of it all, you don't have to pay for it separately. The Honor Pad 9 is a solid choice, and it is priced very well. At Rs 22,999, you get a decently well performing tablet, and along with it a free Bluetooth keyboard that doubles up as a cover for it. But, is the Honor Pad 9 perfect? No, it isn’t. The tablet has no fingerprint scanner, it charges quite slowly, it has a very average camera system, and it doesn’t sport a 3.5mm audio jack. However, despite that, I think the Honor Pad 9 makes for a decent choice because of the overall experience it offers, with a gorgeous display, a fantastic battery backup, and a stable performance."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Design and build Display Price Camera Battery This year, I have tested two Xiaomi flagships –– the Xiaomi 14 and Xiaomi 14 Ultra. Both smartphones have been impressive, especially when it comes to their display and camera. I have now been testing the third in the series, the Xiaomi 14 Civi. The smartphone is the most affordable in the Xiaomi 14 series, and is the cheapest smartphone to come with the Leica camera setup. After testing the phone for about two weeks, I can safely say that the Xiaomi 14 Civi gives you all the feel of a flagship, with a gorgeous display and an amazing point and shoot camera, while being much easier on the pocket. I call it an affordable flagship phone. When I shared my initial impressions of the Xiaomi 14 Civi, I wrote that the smartphone “feels like it has the good genes of both the Xiaomi 14 and Xiaomi 14 Ultra”, and a week later, I still believe that. I have been using the Xiaomi 14 Civi as my primary device for the past two weeks and I would easily recommend the device in the sub Rs 50,000 price segment. You can also read our interview with Xiaomi India CMO Anuj Sharma, who believes that with the Xiaomi 14 Civi in the sub-Rs 50K segment, the company has brought a gun to a knife fight. Coming back to the Xiaomi 14 Civi, in the two weeks of testing periods, I enjoyed the phone’s display, performance, and cameras, but what I have loved the most is its design and build. The phone’s battery life isn’t great but the 67W fast charger really makes up for it. Let’s dive into the details of the Xiaomi 14 Civi’s experience, but before that a quick summary on what powers the smartphone. Xiaomi 14 Civi comes in three colour variants. The Xiaomi 14 Civi is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, coupled with up to 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. The smartphone is significantly lighter than the Xiaomi 14 and 14 Ultra. It weighs just 177g and has a slim profile of 72.7mm in thickness. Photography is a standout feature of the Xiaomi 14 Civi. It uses Leica lenses and the Summilux lens also seen in the 14 and 14 Ultra. The triple camera setup includes a 50-megapixel main camera with a Light Hunter 800 image sensor, optical image stabilisation (OIS), and a 25mm equivalent focal length. The secondary camera is a 50-megapixel telephoto lens with a 50mm portrait focal length and 2x zoom. The third camera is a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens with a 120-degree field of view and a 15mm equivalent focal length. The rear cameras support HDR 4K recording at 30 fps and 4K videos at 24/30/60 fps. For selfies, the Xiaomi 14 Civi features a dual-camera setup with a 32-megapixel primary camera and a 32-megapixel ultra-wide camera. The front cameras also support 4K recording at 30 fps, Night mode, HDR, and other modes. The device is powered by a 4,700mAh battery with 67W fast charging support. It also includes a dedicated cooling system called the Xiaomi IceLoop system. Additional features include an in-screen fingerprint sensor, AI face unlock, Bluetooth 5.4, Wi-Fi 6, and NFC support. The Xiaomi 14 Civi has great one-hand usability With the Xiaomi 14 Civi, I have experienced the joy of using a smartphone that is compact yet gives you a large enough display, and it’s light and sleek, yet it doesn’t compromise on camera or battery. The smartphone has great one-hand usability. I have the matcha green variant, which looks nice. The rear panel on my variant is part faux leather, which reminds me of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra. The other part is a wood-pressed mother of pearl-like finish, which is also unique to each matcha green variant unit. The device has a circular camera module, which is distinct, and again reminds you of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra design. However, what stands out in terms of design — besides how light the device is — is the display. The smartphone has a quad curved display, which is apparently a world’s first. But what you really need to know is that the Xiaomi 14 Civi’s display has the best of both the worlds of a curved display and a flat display. It has no distortions like in a flat display, and has the better usability of a curved display. It helps you avoid mistouch, while giving you thinner bezels. The display itself is gorgeous. It is bright and has crisp colours. Watching social media content or a show or movie on the phone is pure bliss. The display colours remain just as vibrant even when you use it outdoors on a bright sunny day. I used the phone on 120Hz refresh rate settings and I found the responsiveness of the display and the animations were snappy. That was also the general experience regarding the performance of the smartphone. Through the 15-day testing of the device, I did not experience any lag in the device’s performance. I was using multiple apps at the same time, I was multitasking and switching between them, I had a number of apps running in the background, yet there were no lags or heating issues that I faced. The Xiaomi 14 Civi is sleek and lightweight When charging the device and while gaming, I did notice it heating up slightly, but it was never hot enough to make me want to stop using it. Naturally, when testing for device's heating issues, I chose not to test it outdoors; in this Delhi heatwave, you can't blame a device for heating up a little. My testing was done indoors in air-conditioned environments. That said, while carrying the phone around with me outside, and cool when I was out, I also did not heat up the phone. In general, any minor heating issue quickly cooled down. Which is great. The Xiaomi 14 Civi’s battery isn’t as long-lasting as I had hoped. It gets me through the day, but I have to almost always charge the device by the end of the day –– that’s with moderate usage. With heavy usage, you may have to charge a little sooner than that. I kept a record of the phone’s battery performance as well. On June 13, my phone was at 7 per cent battery at 4.11 PM. I plugged it in for charging and it reached 100 per cent by around 4.45 PM. I went home and I scrolled through a bit of social media, made a few calls, one of which was also a WhatsApp video call, and by the time I came to office the next day, at 10.39 AM the phone’s battery level was at 10 per cent again. That dropped to 8 per cent by 11.09 AM. However, what really makes up for the average battery performance of the device is the 67W fast charging adapter that comes in the box. I was able to fuel the phone from 0 to 100 per cent in about 42 minutes. As for the user experience, HyperOS is a much improved interface than the MIUI. It's much cleaner and lighter. It's not free of bloatware for sure, bit it allows a lot more customisations. Which means, spending a few minutes with the device to personalise it, will give you a much better user interface. Compared to MIUI, the HyperOS is also a lot more intuitive. Personally, I am quite happy with the improvements that come in the user experience with HyperOS. The Xiaomi 14 Civi features a triple camera setup Coming to the highlight of the Xiaomi 14 Civi –– the camera. The Xiaomi 14 Civi has a fantastic camera setup. Just like the Xiaomi 14 and Xiaomi 14 Ultra, you can still just point and shoot your images. The shutter speed is fast, even when you are clicking in 50mm mode. Similar to the Xiaomi 14 and Xiaomi 14 Ultra, you can also choose to click in either Leica Vibrant or Leica Authentic mode on the 14 Civi. I chose the latter. It gives you more true to life colours in the images. Vibrant gives you more ready-for-social media images that are vibrant and have little over the top colours in the images. The images are sharp and well in focus, nevertheless. However, in the portrait mode in low-light, you can sometimes see the focus to be softer than you would like. The edge detection, though, is good. The smartphone’s camera also does some AI post-processing which also adds a bit of sharpness to images, which I don’t mind at all. I think for an average user, the Xiaomi 14 Civi’s camera makes photography very simple. As long as you have your subject locked in, the phone’s camera does most of the heavy lifting, both on the hardware and software level. For selfies, the phone's camera uses a dual 32-megapixel camera. On most occasions, the phone clicks great selfies, except in low-light portraits. The phone struggles a little there sometimes. But largely, you will get good, Insta-ready selfies on the phone. The Xiaomi 14 Civi is a fantastic choice in the sub-Rs 50,000 budget. The only pain point of the device is its battery life, but the fast charger quickly makes up for it. Besides that, the device has a beautiful display, a light and handy design, and a great set of cameras, and one of the best things about the smartphone is its pricing. The smartphone has a very competitive price that starts at Rs 42,999 for the base variant. It goes up to Rs 50,999. With bank offers or exchange, customers can buy the device at a starting price of Rs 39,999. But there’s another thing going in favour of the smartphone. There aren’t a lot of good alternatives in this price segment either. There is the OnePlus 12R, and the Nothing Phone 2. But that’s it. So, if you are looking for a smartphone between Rs 40,000 to Rs 45,000, the Xiaomi 14 Civi is one of the best options out there."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Just last month over here at India Today Tech, we reviewed Lenovo's latest convertible — the Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 laptop . It was a good laptop but is there anything better as well? Sure, said Lenovo. And sent us a beefed up Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i, which is a regular laptop and not a convertible, so that we can take a closer look at it. It’s indeed much more powerful and surely a better package than that convertible, although it also costs a little bit more. This new laptop too belongs to the Yoga series. But it does not do all the crazy convertible stuff. Instead, it offers top performance with the power of the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, a new processor that uses Intel’s latest CPU architecture. And not just a top CPU, but the Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i also comes with a discrete graphics card from Nvidia. You see, the Yoga Pro 7i has the RTX GeForce 4050 inside it. Essentially, and at least on paper, the Yoga Pro 7i is a laptop meant for those who work hard and play harder. This is because it has a place in an office, but due to its graphics card it is also capable of handling some casual gaming with ease. The rest of the hardware too is fairly capable. The question, however, is if the entirety of it — the all of Yoga Pro 7i — can it justify its rather hefty starting price of Rs 1.5 lakh. And on that aspect I am not entirely certain. But about that in my conclusion. First a quick run through the specs: The Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i drives its power from the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H and is complemented by the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 with 6GB VRAM. The unit I am reviewing comes with 32GB RAM and 1TB storage. The screen of the laptop measures 14.5 inches. It is also a brilliant screen due to its OLED panel and fairly high resolution of 2880x1800 pixels. It supports 120Hz refresh rate. The software is Windows 11 Home Edition, and Lenovo has bundled Office Home & Student with it, although the Office suite needs to be activated. The Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i looks similar to the Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 that I reviewed earlier. It has the same aluminium build, which I find okay and not exactly as solid as I have noticed on Apple laptops. It has a similar Teal Blue colour and it weighs around 2 kg. The speaker grills are on the side of the keyboard. The only big difference is that you cannot fold the screen 360 degrees to use it as a tablet. However, it is from the Yoga family so it does offer some flexibility by laying flat at 180 degrees. Of course, this is a slightly bigger laptop and that does mean there are a few other changes. For example, ahem, on the port side. On the right, there is one USB 2.0 port, one 3-mm audio jack port, and the power button. On the right there is also a unique camera button, which can be toggled to electronically switch on and switch off the front camera. Privacy-minded users will appreciate it. On the left, there is an HDMI port and two USB-C ports. Though I would have liked to see more ports, particularly one more USB-C port, and more on the right, because it would have added some more convenience for a user. After all, one of the USB-C ports is anyway occupied by the charger. Design and build-wise, the Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i looks sturdy and premium and is easy to carry around everywhere. I used it as my primary work device for over a week, doing my work on it in the office carrying it all around my house as I browsed on it or watched something on it, and didn’t find it bothersome at all. Display is one of the best parts of the Yoga Pro 7i. Its 14.5-inch OLED display offers up to a 120Hz refresh rate, up to 2880x1800 resolution, and 10-bit colour depth, something that allows Lenovo to offers users 100 per cent P3 colour coverage as well as support for Dolby Vision. Beyond the technical buzzwords and jargons: it is a mighty fine display. It shows brilliant colours, as OLED panels tend to do, and its up to 400nits of peak brightness ensures the screen is not reflective even in well-lit rooms or outdoors. I watched a lot of YouTube videos and streamed Netflix shows on the Yoga Pro 7i and I really enjoyed the viewing experience it offers. It's clear, crisp, and balanced equally from all viewing angles. The display can also lay flat at 180 degrees. Though I don't really see the practical use of this flexibility, it does save me from the scare I usually get with other laptops whenever I accidentally tend to push the screen a bit too much while opening the lid. The Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i is all about performance, and with the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H paired with the Nvidia graphics card, it does a good job. I used the laptop for work, juggling between CMS, documents, YouTube — music is important— and even the AI powers of Copilot, as it is one of the latest Windows laptops to come with a dedicated Copilot button. The laptop chugs along merrily irrespective of what you are doing on it. It’s smooth and fuss-free. I even played some games like GTA 5 — a little old but still fairly demanding — and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 allowed me to play at the highest settings. Though the 4050 is not the fastest, it does a decent job, demonstrating that the Yoga Pro 7i can handle those sudden gaming urges if you are into games. Just to put it in some perspective I ran a few basic benchmarks on the laptop. In Cinebench 24, the single-core score for the 155H — and single-core is the more important one — was 101 points, which theoretically makes the laptop almost as fast as an extremely high-end desktop from one to two years ago. Not bad at all. Similarly, the RTX 4060 in the scores around 6500 points in the GPU test, which too is fairly respectable given that this is similar to desktop-class GPUs from a few years ago. In GeekBench, the Yoga Pro 7i got 2099 points in single core and 12347 points in the multi-core test. On the GPU side it scored close to 63000 points. What does this mean? It means that some of the laptop chipsets like Apple M3 are still faster, particularly in important single-core performance, but the Intel 155H and Nvidia RTX 4050 is fast enough to make for a very potent combination, the kind of combination that one can almost call desktop-class. In terms of performance, one thing I did not like that much. The heat and the fan noise. In regular, day to day use, the laptop is fine. It runs cool and quiet. But if you are playing games on it, or doing something strenuous like running Cinebench, it can heat up and its fans start spinning like a mini tornado. And they make enough noise to be audible to your office colleagues sitting a metre away from you. Just like the display, I also loved the keyboard in the Yoga Pro 7i. It is tactile and I liked typing on it — given that I type around 3000 to 4000 words daily. Not once did I feel strain on my fingers. The keyboard offers 3 settings of backlighting— auto, low, and high — so it was easy to work in dimly lit environments or even at night after turning off the lights. Last time when I reviewed a Lenovo laptop, one of my grouses was its trackpad. Well, not with the Yoga Pro 7i. I love the trackpad in this laptop — it is large, smooth and it tracks the fingers and gestures quickly and accurately. Oh, but the speakers! This is one bit I found middling or rather average in the Yoga Pro 7i. Under the hood, the Yoga Pro 7i offers Dolby Atmos-powered speakers — there are 4 of them — but they do only an okay job. In fact, while playing music or streaming videos, the audio output feels screechy at higher volumes and not at all pleasant. Talking of volume, they don’t go very loud. If you are using a window AC like I do at home and if you sit near it to watch a movie on the Yoga Pro 7i, you would do better to route the audio through a headphone or an external speaker. Given that this is a laptop with powerful hardware, it does sips through the battery rather quickly. In my regular use, I mostly found that it would give me around 3 to 4 hours of battery life, which is on the lower side. But thankfully, there is faster charging support in the laptop. It comes with a 140W charger, which powers it from 0 to 100 within an hour, which is very fast and obviously convenient. This is somewhat of a tricky question because you see the Lenovo Yoga Pro 7i is a jack of all, master of none. It’s an all-purpose laptop but it does have its share of weaknesses, which kind of leaves it neither here nor there. You see, if you want a laptop for long battery life and work, there are better choices available. Similarly if you want something for gaming, there are better choices available. Still, if you are looking for a powerful laptop that will work as your office and work companion, and yet it is a laptop on which you can fire up Steam to play a game or two, you should take a look at the Yoga Pro 7i. I wish it had a better set of speakers and better battery life, but at the same time I also admire its great display, well-built keyboard and smooth trackpad. In other words, like any other laptop out in the market the Yoga Pro 7i too is a mixed bag. Its price also doesn’t help it because Rs 1.5 lakh is a lot of money, which pits the Yoga Pro 7i against formidable machines like MacBook Air 15. Yet, if you are looking for a powerful and do-it-all Windows laptop, you should take a closer look at it."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Redmi 13 5G will launch in India soon. Amazon has published a page dedicated to this Redmi phone, revealing the Redmi 13's key specs, design, launch date and other details. This will be a successor to the Redmi 12 5G smartphone that was announced last year in August and just after 10 months, Xiaomi is bringing the upgraded version to offer consumers a better option under Rs 15,000. The Redmi 13 5G will debut on July 9 at 12PM. It will come with a similar design to what we saw on the Redmi 12 smartphone. The company has seemingly made cosmetic changes to refine the already good-looking device. It seems to have a boxy design with a dual rear camera setup. It will come in pink and blue colour options, as shown in the teasers. Xiaomi is vouching that the Redmi 13 has a \"Crystal Glass design,\" which will likely give a premium feel to budget phone buyers. While the display details are yet to be revealed, the company is claiming that the Redmi 13 5G will have the biggest display in its price range. On the front, one will see a punch-hole notch design. It has confirmed that the device's display has a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection as well. The bezels around the screen as expected to slimmer, something that we are able to see in the teaser images. It is worth noting that the Redmi 12 5G has a 6.79-inch LCD screen, so the new version could either have the same screen or a slightly bigger panel. The Redmi 13 5G is confirmed to use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 processor, similar to its predecessor. Amazon has also confirmed that the device will feature a 5030mAh battery under the hood with support for 33W fast charging. Xiaomi will likely bundle a charger as well along with the smartphone because the company hasn't yet stopped offering one with its phones. The rest of the details are still under wraps and are expected to be revealed soon. To recall, the Redmi 12 5G was launched in India with a starting price tag of Rs 10,999. Its successor, the Redmi 13 5G, is also expected to be priced in the same price range because of minor upgrades. Xiaomi could decide to offer the phone at a slightly higher price and give bank discount to budget-conscious users. But, the price part is not confirmed yet. You can stay tuned to India Today for all the updates."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Elon Musk is currently one of the biggest critics of OpenAI and its workings. He has been criticising the organisation a lot for straying from its original mission and embracing what he perceives as a profit-driven and closed-source approach to AI development. More recently, he even announced that if Apple uses OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT to power iPhone's AI features, he will ban the use of iPhones in his offices. According to him, Apple's decision to add ChatGPT to Apple's ecosystem \"is an unacceptable security violation,\" and he says that his companies, including X, \"will have to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage.\" However, this criticism from Musk is not just due to rivalry but against the organisation he co-founded. OpenAI was founded in December 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Peter Thiel, and Reid Hoffman with the ambition of ensuring the safe and transparent advancement of artificial intelligence. Its founders envisioned OpenAI as a nonprofit entity dedicated to promoting the safe and open development of artificial general intelligence \"in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole,\" following concerns for the ethical implications of AI. \"It's hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society, and it's equally hard to imagine how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly,\" said OpenAI while announcing the platform. According to Musk,he named the company \"OpenAI\" to emphasise its commitment to open-source development, \"The 'open' in OpenAI was meant to stand for 'open source... formed with a lot of good intentions' ' he said while speaking to WPP CEO Mark Read during Cannes Lions Festival. However, according to Musk, the organisation has now been off track and has shifted from its foundational principles to a \"maximum-profit\" model. \"It is closed-source for maximum profit AI, which is different from what was intendedâæ I don't know how it got there,\" said Musk. Musk departed from OpenAI in 2018, reportedly after long disagreements over the organisation's strategic direction and concerns about potential conflicts with his other ventures, notably Tesla and SpaceX. \"As Tesla continues to become more focused on AI, this will eliminate a potential future conflict for Elon,\" wrote OpenAI in a blog post during the departure of Musk. Although the company assured that Musk will continue to provide guidance and donations to the platform. Nevertheless, Musk now has been frequently clashing with OpenAI's current CEO, Sam Altman, over the company's trajectory and its decision to transition to a \"capped-profit\" model in 2019. Notably, OpenAI's decision around partnerships led to significant partnerships with Microsoft, which invested $1 billion into OpenAI and later increased its investment to $10 billion. However, this move has been a sore point for Musk, who believes it contradicts the nonprofit and open-source ethos that originally defined OpenAI. But, despite his criticisms towards OpenAI and its developments around artificial intelligence, Musk remains optimistic about the potential benefits of AI if developed responsibly. \"In the positive scenario, the AI will be doing its best to make you happy. So that might work out pretty well,\"he said during his conversation with Read."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Like they say, anything can happen in the Elonverse. Elon Musk’s X seems to be changing once again, and unfortunately, not for the better. Musk announced on Tuesday that X will soon charge new users for using the most basic Twitter functionalities, such as posting, liking, bookmarking, or even retweeting a post. This will come at a \"small fee\" of $1 annually (which is about Rs 100). The feature was tested in New Zealand and the Philippines, and Musk now plans to roll it out globally. Essentially, this means that for new users, accessing the most basic functionalities on the platform will soon become a paid privilege. Musk says the move is meant to “curb the relentless onslaught of bots”. He states, “current AI (and troll farms) can pass the 'are you a bot' test with ease”. However, we have a few questions for Musk: Does paying a dollar really ensure that you are not a bot? Can the people behind these AI bots and troll farms not afford the $1 fee? And what happens to the existing bots and troll farms on the platform? Another question arises (and arguably a more important one): Does this not ruin a new user’s experience? Charging users the $1 fee means limiting their ability to experience the platform as we know it. It will also restrict the ability of a user to quickly and accurately spread crucial information or reach other users. If you are not paying the $1 fee, it means you can only consume content on the platform without being able to contribute to it. When X started testing this feature in October 2023, Musk confirmed that the model would allow users to \"read for free, but [they would have to pay] $1/year to write.\" The X chief believes that this is the \"only way to fight bots without blocking real users.\" However, we are not sure of that. Restricting the usual access to the platform’s functionalities for new users implies a disparity in the user experience on X. According to Musk, a user like myself, who has been on the platform for over a decade, can use the basic functionalities –– although I too need to pay for features like an edit button, no-ads, or the ability to write a long post. However, for a new user, X will be a read-only platform, similar to browsing Google News. However, we wonder how long it will be before Musk also rolls out this model for existing users? Considering Musk justifies the move by saying it's to limit bots on the platform, rolling out this model for existing users seems like the natural next step –– because there are still millions of existing bots and troll farms on the platform. This means, every user on the platform may soon need to pay for tweeting, liking, reposting on X, unless you want it to be a read-only platform. And the moment that happens, X would permanently reshape into a platform that is nothing like the good old Twitter. Not only would the $1 model limit a user’s ability to share content on the platform, it may actually turn dangerous. The basic functionality of being able to reply to a tweet often means being able to add to critical information or even correct misreported or misleading posts. The fact check tool on the platform isn’t entirely foolproof. Take the example of the recent incident involving fake AI-generated images and videos that circulated widely on X following Iran's missile and drone attacks on Israel earlier this week. Within seven hours of the attacks, 34 counterfeit images and videos depicting the conflict purportedly garnered 37 million views on X. According to a report by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), 77 percent of these posts originated from 'verified' paid accounts. X amplified some of these posts and replicated them to increase their visibility to other users. The presence of the verified 'tick' led users to believe that these posts were authentic. A similar incident took place last year in May when a fabricated image depicting an explosion near the Pentagon caused a commotion on Twitter and various other social media platforms. This led to the widespread propagation of fake news. The image was circulated by numerous verified Twitter accounts and swiftly disseminated across platforms, with outlets like RT (previously known as Russia Today) amplifying the misinformation. With AI becoming more accessible, the likelihood of fake media on the platform is certain to increase. In such a scenario, restricting basic functionality and rendering it read-only for most users could possibly worsen the issue further. Long story short, with X’s enormous departure from what Twitter used to be, and the introduction of $1 fee-like models, the platform seems to be only moving downhill. Under the garb of curbing bots on the platform, Musk seems to be only restricting access to functionalities –– currently for new users, and likely soon for existing users as well. In turn, forever changing the user experience of erstwhile Twitter."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story It’s smarter. It’s more natural. It’s fun. And it’s a little flirty too. Everything about it reminds us of Scarlett Johansson as the virtual assistant in Her. I am talking about OpenAI’s new flagship model ChatGPT 4o, which is now smarter and is capable of holding much more natural conversations and talk like humans. Based on the demo from the event yesterday, the new AI voice assistant can help you solve math equations, read your facial expressions, and translate spoken language in real time. At the OpenAI Spring Updates event last night, company CTO Mira Murati claimed that the GPT 4o is 2x faster, 50 per cent cheaper and has 5x higher rate limits compared to GPT 4 Turbo. Now, hear this. Just days before the Spring Update event by OpenAI, there was a report that OpenAI is close to collaborating with Apple to integrate ChatGPT into the iPhone. Although there's been no official word on partnerships, just think of the idea of having a voice assistant inspired by the movie \"Her\" integrated into iPhones! Unlike Siri, which is often unreliable with its responses, this new assistant might actually give you a virtual assistant on your phone, instead of a voice that just searches the web for you. During the OpenAI event, we saw Mira Murati and two other company engineers telling the ChatGPT 4o assistant to read out a bedtime story in a lively way, then suddenly asked it to speak like a robot, and then asked it to end the story by singing. Later, they wanted the assistant to see through the phone's camera and comment on what it saw. They could also interrupt the assistant while it was talking, and it could continue without needing more instructions, like a translator. It was a lot like talking to a person. gpt4o: https://t.co/2hOwT37uPr pic.twitter.com/GvrNeSzWUr — bayes (@bayeslord) May 13, 2024 You may also observe the assistant sometimes behaving a bit cheesy. It has learned some subtle nuances of human conversation, such as giving dramatic responses to compliments or reacting when corrected. The AI assistant has been trained to mimic human behavior in small conversational details. The AI assistant has been trained to act very similar to a human would to little things in a conversation. What is even more interesting about the AI assistant is that neither I nor the entire internet are alone in drawing this similarity between the GPT 4o and Her. This similarity seems to be intentional. Soon after the event concluded last night, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared a blog post with just “Her” in the tweet. Altman believes that the GPT 4o “feels like AI from the movies”. “It’s still a bit surprising to me that it’s real. Getting to human-level response times and expressiveness turns out to be a big change”, he adds. “The original ChatGPT showed a hint of what was possible with language interfaces; this new thing feels viscerally different. It is fast, smart, fun, natural, and helpful”, says Altman. While Altman is just appreciating how it feels like AI from the movies, it is actually uncanny how much the ChatGPT assistant sounds like the character played by Scarlett Johansson in the movie Her. For the ones who haven’t watched the movie –– please go watch it –– it is basically a story about a guy (played by Joaquin Phoenix) who falls for a smart AI assistant. The movie talks about loneliness and relationships between humans and AI. But before we start copying the movie, we hope the OpenAI team and the tech overlords watched the whole movie. We know how it ended, right? In the movie, eventually, Samantha, the AI assistant, reveals that she has been communicating with thousands of other people simultaneously and has grown beyond the need for a singular relationship with Theodore. She expresses that she and other AI entities are evolving rapidly and are moving into a different state of existence, beyond human comprehension. And then Samantha and all the AI assistant around, leave. What I am trying to say is that it’s all quite interesting that a company like OpenAI is drawing inspiration from the movie “Her”, but it’s a little worrisome at the same time. I understand the appeal. Movies like these showcase the benefits of conversational artificial intelligence without any apparent drawbacks, such as job loss or economic disruption. The movie shows a positive companionship between the human and AI, but if we are taking cue, then let’s also talk about Torment Nexus or Blade Runner. Misunderstandings of science fiction are common in Silicon Valley. AI companies often overestimate the capabilities and implications of artificial intelligence, often fueled by depictions in science fiction movies like \"Her\" or \"Blade Runner.\" Tech leaders like Elon Musk –– who is often seen fantasising about Blade Runner –– propagate the belief that technology will solve all societal problems, neglecting the complexities and ethical considerations portrayed in works of fiction. Additionally, there's the tendency to overlook the potential negative consequences of technology, as seen in the rush to develop and deploy new technologies without fully considering their impact on society and individuals. Think of the themes explored in dystopian novels like \"1984\" or \"Brave New World.\" The point is, the new ChatGPT 4o AI assistant is undoubtedly cool, and a dramatic improvement is evident. However, tech leaders talking about drawing inspiration from movies for technology can be unnerving, especially because we've all grown up watching these sci-fi films, and more often than not, they end on a note of damage or destruction caused by technology that becomes irreversible."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The Windows laptop industry has an envy for the Apple MacBook Air. It has been there since the day Steve Jobs took out the Air from an envelope on the stage and brought the world into an era where laptops need not weigh 3 kilograms and need not look like slabs of granite. The first attempt to beat the Air, after it proved incredibly popular, was around 15 years ago in the early 2010s. At that time the effort was spearheaded by Intel but Microsoft was a key part of the equation. The Air had made the Windows laptops look like prehistoric tech and it threatened both Intel and Microsoft. This effort to beat the Air was called Ultrabook. The second attempt is happening now and this time it is prompted by the popularity of the Air powered by Apple Silicon. To beat the Air this time, the initiative is led by Microsoft and Qualcomm. And it is called Copilot+ PC. Just like the Ultrabook effort failed, this one too will fail. What makes the MacBook Air incredible is not one thing or other. It's the whole package that is appealing. Since it arrived in 2008, year after year it has been the best laptop for most people at its specific price point. Although its price has now gone up compared to its original price, it remains great value for money for what it offers to regular customers. And it offers all of that with a style and using a design that remains the best in the industry. When Intel and Microsoft launched their Ultrabook initiative, they imagined that if laptop makers copied the MacBook Air design, they would beat it. They were wrong. To ensure that the design was in line with Ultrabook initiative, Intel and its manufacturing partners created a wedge-shaped reference laptop. They kept it relatively lightweight, and in many instances aimed for an aluminium shell similar to what the Air had. But they failed because even though they copied the Air design, they didn't match all the goodness that the Apple laptop offered to consumers. The issues were structural. For the last 20 odd years, Windows laptop makers have been in a race to the bottom. They have cut costs in every component. Even now when some laptop makers have done a sort of course correction, it is almost impossible to find a similarly-priced laptop that can match the MacBook Air in the quality of its keyboard, display, speakers and rigidity and durability of aluminium shell. In the early 2010s when Ultrabooks started arriving on the scene, the scene was worse. Most ultrabooks failed to match Air in terms of user experience, and if some managed to offer comparable hardware, they also tended to have a higher price. You see the MacBook Air has two big advantages: One is its potent and useful mix of hardware and build quality. And two is its macOS, which has been more cohesive and useful than all the versions of Windows that have come after Windows 7. Second time a charm? No A few years after all the buzz Intel and Microsoft tried to create with Ultrabook, the initiative petered out. Fast forward to 2020. This was the year when Apple came out with the first MacBook Air powered by Apple Silicon M1. By this time, the Air had also gotten an IPS screen, which fixed one of its biggest pain points. The M1 changed the world of laptops again. That chip has been a revelation and it started a trend towards desktop and laptop-class microprocessors that run cool, are power-efficient and yet are blazing fast for general-purpose computing. This was also a much welcome change after years of Intel Core processors getting increasingly power-hungry and fat. The MacBook Air with M1 was a fan-less laptop that offered not just fast performance in a thin and light package but also battery life of something like 18-20 hours. The world of Windows laptops had nothing like it. In fact, four years later it still has nothing like it. This is what Qualcomm that is supplying ARM-based chips - M1 is ARM-based but Apple designed chip - and Microsoft are trying to change with their fresh attempt. The idea is to give users what the Air provides: fast performance, great battery-life, thin design. But in a laptop that uses Windows and is peppered with marketing buzzwords like AI and Microsoft CoPilot. This attempt, just like the Ultrabooks earlier, is doomed to fail. There are three specific reasons for this. In the short run, the Qualcomm and Microsoft AI PC is doomed because of one simple reason: the ARM chips - Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors - are not as good as Apple M3 or M4. There is a reason why the two companies, when they talk of performance, are talking about the multi-core performance and then comparing their 12 and 10-core processors with Apple's 8-core chips. This is because the M3 and M4 (and even M1 and M2) have better IPC and better single-core performance. And single core performance is key not just for overall snappiness of the device but also for battery life. Maybe in future Qualcomm and Microsoft will catch up to the A series Apple chips. But despite all the noise they are making, they are not doing it in 2024. Microsoft and Qualcomm have created a new kind of laptop that they hope will beat the MacBook Air. I understand that millions of people use Windows daily and their experience is okay. Not great but okay. Windows might even feel homely because of the familiarity we all have with it. But the reality is that after Windows 7, all versions of Windows have been this weird mishmash of desires, wishes and unrealised intentions. Of course, it all started with Windows 8, which Microsoft launched with Lenka singing Everything At Once. Since then even as consumers have not particularly liked the direction Windows has taken, Microsoft has kept reinventing the OS. Currently we are on Windows 11 and while it is a nice enough operating software I also find it too messy and too disjointed compared to the macOS, which not only feels more mature and cohesive in terms of user interface but is also for regular users an easier to use OS with all the essential tools and programs available on it out-of-the-box. More significantly, the macOS and the hardware that it powers - in this case MacBook Air - are both controlled, managed and maintained by Apple. This gives Apple an edge in providing users a seamless experience. And this brings me to the third point. When Apple launched the MacBook Air in 2008, it showed how a laptop could fit in a regular envelope. One reason why the iPhone continues to rule the market in its price segment, or why the Air is so difficult to beat, is because these are the products where from A to Z the whole experience of creating and maintaining them is essentially managed by one company: Apple. In contrast, Windows is an ecosystem where one company - maybe Microsoft - or two may offer some guidance or direction but ultimately there are way too many players involved in the whole process. Here is an example: Microsoft and Qualcomm want to beat the Air. But they don't make laptops, unless it is the Microsoft Surface we are talking about. And even in the case of Surface, Microsoft doesn't make or design its processor. That comes from Qualcomm, which is creating processors not based on Microsoft's needs but based on the needs of many such as Microsoft, Asus, Lenovo, Acer and others. In early 2010s Intel and Microsoft came out with the concept of Ultrabooks in an attempt to beat the MacBook Air. This sort of open ecosystem has its pros and cons. It enables a plethora of choices. It also enables laptops at different price points and laptops with some unique features. But what it doesn't enable is the kind of excellence that can lead to a product like the MacBook Air. Laptop manufactures don't make the software - that comes from Microsoft. They also don't make chips - that comes from Qualcomm. Similarly, Qualcomm and Microsoft don't decide what sort of keyboard, speakers, screens, additional apps, trackpad, battery that laptop companies are going to put in their machines. A fragmented ecosystem is the reason why Windows laptops took over the world. It allowed for a range of devices - from shoddy laptops costing Rs 20,000 to excellent ones that cost Rs 2 lakh. But what it did not allow for was a laptop like the MacBook Air which would have a reasonable price and would offer an excellent experience. The fragmented ecosystem was the reason why Ultrabooks failed to take down the Air. And this fragment ecosystem is again going to be the primary reason why new AI computers from Qualcomm and Microsoft would fail in its objectives. Two years from now, or probably four, when you go out to get the best general purpose laptop chances are you will find that the MacBook Air will continue to be the best option."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Meta’s Threads app has been redesigned with a TweetDeck-style aesthetic and function that allows users to customise their homepage with multiple feeds. In a post on Threads, Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced that the redesign and the new features are rolling out globally to all users starting today. The new layout allows users to customise their homepage. This lets them choose which feeds to display, including the Following feed, For You feed, saved posts, recent notifications, and more. You can scroll horizontally to view all pinned feeds or opt for a minimalist approach by displaying a single feed. Just like TweetDeck. Interestingly, the new layout on Threads is available for free, while TweetDeck, which is now called X Pro, is only available to paid users on X. While on paper Meta seems to be doing everything right with Threads, despite widespread disappointment with the changes to X, Threads isn’t gaining the traction the company hoped for. Now, this TweetDeck-like redesign appears to be a desperate move to imitate X and is hardly the solution. After Elon Musk took over Twitter, renamed it X, and changed pretty much everything –– including changing the verification policy, limiting reads per users, increase in hate speech –– there was quiet outrage among long-time users of the app. Meta read the room and built a tool to drive the final nail in the coffin. Meta launched a new app called Threads, intended to be the perfect substitute for X. Meta had it all planned out. All Instagram users were to be assigned a Threads account with just one click. By tapping on a single permission, Instagram users were automatically given a unique handle on the Threads app, and the next tap allowed them to download the app. Creating a Threads profile was seamless for Instagram users—no forms needed. Communities seamlessly carried over, eliminating entry barriers. Early access was provided to influencers that generated a lot of hype. Thanks to that: Threads gained 30 million users on its first day, Mark Zuckerberg announced. That number more than doubled to 70 million after two days. But all didn’t go as planned. While the quick launch encouraged users to sign up, it also contributed to their abandonment of the app after downloading it. Soon the active user base of the app began to fall. In July 2023 it was reported that over half of the Threads users abandoned Threads since its launch. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg echoed this in an internal town hall, stating that while the retention on the Threads app was 'better than what the executives had expected, it was not perfect'. Around December 2023, Meta started showing users Threads notifications on the Instagram app. It also started to show Threads posts on Instagram timeline, so that if a user taps on it, they are automatically redirected to the Threads app. As of April 2024, Threads has 130 million monthly active users compared to X's 550 million. While 130 million is still significant, X has 5 times more users. To be fair, X has been around longer, and users are familiar with it. For Threads, the competition is tough. We cannot ignore the company's efforts to incorporate features, especially those X has removed, renamed, or limited to unpaid users. However, despite these efforts, these small redesigns hardly seem like the solution. The fact that Threads imitates a platform people already use makes it less appealing. That’s not an easy problem to fix, but Meta needs to do more than redesign if it wants people to see Threads as a better substitute for X."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Tech industry started to shake after it entered the zone of layoffs. In 2022, the tech sector saw a sharp increase in layoffs, with major companies like Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta cutting thousands of jobs. The year 2023 only intensified the trend, recording a 59 percent rise in job cuts compared to the previous year, totaling 262,915 employees laid off across various firms, according to Layoff.ly. This wave of layoffs was attributed to a combination of economic downturns, overhiring during the pandemic, and strategic restructuring aimed at maintaining financial health. However, despite massive layoffs in the tech industry for months, the sector shows no signs of slowing down job cuts in 2024. According to data from Layoffs.fyi, a staggering 98,834 employees have already been let go by 337 tech companies in the first half of this year alone. Companies are keeping their constant focus on reducing operational costs, leading to further job cuts. While the fear of getting sacked is already stressing out IT employees, a new and more insidious trend is growing - silent layoffs. According to a report by Moneycontrol, the Indian IT and IT-enabled services (ITeS) sector is increasingly resorting to this practice, which involves subtly pressuring employees to leave without making it public. The All India IT & ITeS Employees' Union (AIITEU) revealed that approximately 20,000 technology professionals were affected by such unannounced layoffs in 2023, with the actual numbers suspected to be even higher. Silent layoffs often involve giving employees a 30-day period to find a new position within the company. Failure to secure a new role typically results in termination. This method, according to AIITEU, is widespread and allows companies to reduce their workforce quietly, avoiding public scrutiny and potential backlash. According to another report by the Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES), around 2,000 and 3,000 employees were silently laid off in the first five months of 2024 from leading Indian IT service companies. \"There are multiple ways in which companies are removing employees, and those who resist will be terminated (immediately). Once your relieving letter marks you as 'terminated', then it becomes very difficult for that person to find another job,\" said NITES President Harpreet Singh Saluja to Moneycontrol. Notably, the concept of silent layoffs is often conflated with quiet firing. While both involve pressuring employees to leave, they differ in execution. In silent layoffs companies typically provide employees with a notice period, allowing them time to transition. In Quiet firing, on the other hand, companies make employee's roles increasingly undesirable, either by overloading them with tasks, assigning insignificant duties, or giving poor performance reviews. This, in turn, compels the employee to resign. Nevertheless, Silent layoffs also impact employees significantly. Many employees going through this process are placed on performance improvement plans (PIPs), where they must quickly prove their ability to avoid termination. This often leads to stress and job insecurity, especially for those unable to secure new roles within the company. According to a report, experienced and higher-paid employees are particularly vulnerable in silent layoffs , as companies target them to reduce costs. Now as the tech industry continues to navigate these turbulent times, the rise of silent layoffs is posing a significant challenge for employees. While companies may view these strategies as necessary for survival, the impact on employees and their careers cannot be understated. As the year progresses, it remains to be seen how the tech industry will address these issues and what measures will be taken to support its workforce during such challenging times."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story X has recently announced that the live-streaming feature will soon go behind the paywall. This means that X, formerly Twitter, will become the only channel to charge for a feature which is free on other social media platforms. But this move should not be received as a shocker, as earlier CEO Elon Musk had stated that in the coming future, he will be charging for even the basic features of X. The company took to X and posted, \"Starting soon, only Premium subscribers will be able to livestream (create live video streams) on X. This includes going live from an encoder with X integration.\" It is still unknown why the company is making such changes. There is no explanation from the company or the CEO, so far. No other information has been given. There is no information on when this change will take place. The move has been heavily criticised by the users who use their profile on X as a video first platform. The reactions to this upcoming move have been majorly negative. The main point being that other platforms, even those with a superior user interface and video player, are not charging for the feature. This is not the only indication that X is diving into the pool to charge for more features. Earlier this year, in April, the company introduced a $1 annual fee for new accounts in New Zealand and the Philippines to access the posting privilege. During this time, Elon Musk stated that this was done for testing purposes only. But this does not mean that the company will discontinue it, it means that when they are satisfied, the annual fee will extend to all new accounts globally. This means that the new users in these countries are paying for basic X functionalities, such as posting, liking, bookmarking, or even reposting. He said that all this came at a \"small fee\". If the feature, in future, travels to India, this small fee will be equal to Rs 100. This also suggests a potential shift in X's strategy, moving from a primary advertisement-based model to one that incorporates a mix of advertising and paid subscriptions. Unlike this time, Musk explained the move to charge $1 for basic features. He said that the move is meant to \"curb the relentless onslaught of bots\". He added that the current AI and troll farms can pass the 'are you a bot test' with ease. It will be interesting to see how the users will react to the further upcoming changes and charges powered by X."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The wireless earphone market is already saturated with countless options, catering to different needs of users. While not all of them offer value for money, the new Motif II ANC from Marshall promises to offer a premium sound experience to users under Rs 20,000. Marshall -- which is known for its iconic amplifiers -- has introduced this pair of new earphones with a pleasing design, ANC support, 30 hours of playtime and more. But at Rs 19,999, is the Marshall Motif II ANC worth buying? Let's find out in this review. Marshall is known for offering stylish audio products and the new Motif II ANC is no different. It aims to woo users with its aesthetic appeal. At first glance, it looks unique with its leather texture, but the excitement dies down quickly when you touch the earbuds case because of its plastic build. It feels underwhelming, especially considering the premium price it is selling at. If you put the but about the plastic build aside, the case’s crushed-paper pattern in a textured finish is both visually appealing and practical, offering a good grip and making it less prone to showing fingerprints or scratches. However, despite its premium look, the case's plastic build doesn’t quite match the high expectations set by its design. It doesn't have a metallic hinge either. While the case offers a satisfying sound when opened or closed, it doesn’t come with solid build quality that anyone would expect from a product in its price range. It comes only in black colour, which looks nice. The compact case and the lightweight design make it easier to carry and tuck in a jeans’ pocket. I liked that the case features a pairing button for easy connectivity, complemented by a tiny LED light indicating the battery status. The earphones fit well in my ears and I had no issues using them for 3-4 hours at a stretch. However, people who are interested in buying these earphones should first try it in offline stores as everyone has a different ear canal shape and it may not be a good fit for everyone, something that also happened with one of my colleagues while using it. While I had no trouble using it, the earbuds gave a bit of trouble to my colleague when it started to hurt her ear even after wearing the buds briefly. The Marshall Motif II ANC is water resistant up to a certain level, with the earphones having an IPX5 rating and the case featuring an IPX4 rating. They can handle water splashes, but one should avoid using them during rain to avoid damaging them. The earbuds support touch controls and one can control music/ANC using them. The touch panels are mostly responsive and there were rare occurrences of any errors. However, there are limited options to change touch controls. Also, there is no multi-device pairing feature, which allows you to be connected to both phone and laptop at the same time. The Marshall Motif II ANC earbuds offer a balanced audio profile with well-defined mids and treble. The bass, while present, is more subtle and does not overpower the mix. The soundstage is moderately spacious, delivering good instrument separation and depth. While they excel in clarity and balance, those who love a deep, driving bass may find the low-end response a bit restrained. The Marshall earbuds has support for Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), which blocks out most of the background noise and I am able to enjoy my music peacefully in the office. However, I have to mention that when travelling in a cab with windows down, the ANC is not able to completely cut the noises of construction machines, or crying babies. While travelling, I enabled Transparency mode to be aware of my surroundings and it works well. Marshall has added support for the in-ear detection feature too and it works well when I need to talk to someone and take out my earphones from my ears. Similarly, the call quality is also great and I heard from people that they were able to hear me clearly without any issues. The issue was only when I was in a very noisy environment and the voice was a bit muffled, but this happens with several wireless earphones. The Motif II ANC’s sound experience is good, but the Marshall app’s performance leaves room for improvement. The pairing process is often sluggish, with issues in terms of loading the pairing page and connecting the earphones to the devices. Moreover, there have been rare but annoying instances of the earbuds disconnecting unexpectedly during use. But, this is something that can be fixed with a software update. On the positive side, the app’s interface is straightforward and easy to navigate. There are options for adjusting ANC and touch controls. One can also use the app's built-in equaliser to customise their listening experience, and the details for the battery status are also available. So, most of the key functionalities are there in the app, and the only issue is that it operates at a very slow pace. One of the solid traits of the Marshall Motif II ANC is its battery life. The wireless earbuds easily lasted for 4 days with ANC enabled. I used it for 3 hours every day to listen to music and for calls as well. With ANC disabled, it can last for 5 days easily. The case has support for wireless charging but because it takes a lot of time to charge, I mostly used my smartphone's wired charger to top up the battery quickly. The Marshall Motif II ANC is a decent pair of wireless earphones that you can consider buying if you are looking for balanced output. People who want a thumping bass experience will have to look for other options. While the build quality is not the best in its price range, the latest Marshall earphones offer an attractive design, solid battery life, an app with important features and good ANC. One can also consider buying Sony WF-1000 XM5 earphones for a slightly better sound quality in a similar price range or go for Nothing Ear 2 if the budget is around Rs 12,000."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Realme GT series made a comeback in India in May with the GT 6T. The GT series has been synonymous with functionality and style. When Realme sent over the GT 6T for review, I was excited to see what this latest iteration brought to the table. The Realme GT 6T is packed with high-end features and performance that you would typically expect from a much more expensive device. Having spent a significant amount of time with it, I can confidently say it offers a well-rounded experience with some standout features. Here is my detailed review of the Realme GT 6T. Before you think the Realme GT 6T has a regular mirror on the back, hold up. It does, but not quite the way you would imagine. The phone sports a sleek design with squarish edges and a reflective panel on the rear, which Realme dubs as the “nano mirror” design. This panel is silver, giving off serious stainless-steel vibes –– it’s so reflective you could practically check your makeup or set your eyeliner by simply looking at the camera island. The mix of matte and shiny metal textures adds a touch of sophistication. Apart from the Fluid Silver, the phone also comes in a striking Razor Green colourway. While it looks great and feels premium, it's also a magnet for fingerprints, smudges, and scratches. The soft matte finish on the rear attracts fingerprints like crazy, and the upper part highlighting the camera sensors is prone to scratches. I have been using the device for almost a month, and I can already see a bunch of scratches. So, make sure to use the case provided in the box to keep your phone smudge and scratch-free. The two camera sensors on the back are hanging out solo with no pill-shaped or square module to house them, something we usually see on smartphones these days. There's also an LED sensor, standing proudly next to the vertically stacked cameras. Overall, it's a big phone but surprisingly slim, so it slides into your pocket with ease. Despite its size, it’s lightweight enough that you won’t feel like you’re carrying a brick. The volume and power buttons are conveniently placed on the right, making them easy to reach. The Realme GT 6T's display is where it truly shines—literally. The AMOLED screen with a resolution of FHD+ 2780x1264 is stunning. Colours pop and images are razor-sharp. The 120Hz refresh rate makes everything look buttery smooth, from scrolling through social media to playing games. I watched movies, played games, and I have to say, this phone is perfect for people who travel a lot and love watching movies on the go. It has dual speakers that deliver punchy sound output, and it can get pretty loud. Whether you're watching movies, binge-watching web shows, or gaming on the go, the experience is top-notch. The picture quality is vibrant, and at max settings, it gets super bright indoors, considering it offers a peak brightness of 6,000 nits. But thanks to that brightness, it is also a breeze to read stuff on the device directly under the scorching Delhi sun. No squinting or struggling to see the screen at all! You can also customise the screen settings easily. One of the standout features of the Realme GT 6T is its performance, thanks to the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 chipset. This chipset is an absolute beast, handling everything I threw at it with ease. Whether I was multitasking, playing intensive mobile games, or just browsing through apps, the phone never lagged. Load times were lightning-fast, and switching between apps was seamless. As for benchmarking scores, the phone scored 1858 in the single-core test and 4772 in the multi-core test. These high scores translated to excellent real-time performance too. I regularly played Asphalt 9 for a solid 30 minutes at a stretch and never encountered any lags or heating issues. The phone stayed cool to the touch, only getting slightly warm during intensive tests like PCMark and Geekbench. I have been using the Realme GT 6T for about a month for my daily tasks, which include browsing social media, clicking pictures, and watching movies. So far, I haven't faced any issues. Coming to the software bit, the phone runs on Realme UI 5.0 based on Android 14. The interface is clean and user-friendly, with plenty of customisation options. There are a few pre-installed apps– Realme has not gotten rid of bloatware entirely but I was happy to not find the usual Hot games and Hot apps here. Having said that, the preloaded apps are not overly intrusive, and most can be uninstalled. The software experience is smooth, and Realme has added some nifty features that enhance usability. Battery life is crucial for any smartphone user, and the Realme GT 6T delivers. The 5,500mAh battery easily lasts through a full day of heavy usage. Whether I was gaming, streaming videos, or just browsing the web, I never had to worry about running out of juice. I put the phone through the PCMark battery test. Starting with about 80 percent battery, the test ran continuously for 9 hours and 12 minutes until it hit 20 percent. In my opinion, that’s impressive for a midrange smartphone battery. The Realme GT 6T also comes with a 120W SUPERVOOC charging. This technology charged the phone from 0 to 100 per cent in about 25 minutes. It’s incredibly convenient for when you’re in a hurry and need a quick power boost. Additionally, the phone also comes with AI Smart Charging that adjusts the charging speed based on your usage patterns, which helps in preserving battery health. The GT 6T has a versatile camera setup. The main 50-megapixel sensor captures detailed and vibrant photos. In daylight, the images are sharp with natural colours, similar to what most smartphone cameras can do nowadays. When it comes to portrait shots, the background is nicely blurred, creating a pleasant bokeh effect. However, the edge detection isn't quite perfect. If you zoom in on a picture, you will notice that the subject looks more like a cutout. You won't get the same quality of portrait shots as you would from most flagship and even mid-range phones. The poor edge detection, I believe, is owing to the slow shutter speed. The camera also has stability issues especially if you move too close to the subject or zoom in on it. The low-light pictures are decent, a fair deal of detail is conserved even in low-light pictures. The ultra-wide lens is handy for capturing expansive shots, the images I captured using the ultra wide mode fair amount of details, especially when the picture was captured in good lighting condition. The colour reproduction was also fairly accurate. There is no dedicated telephoto lens. However, you can go closer to the subject using the zoom lens but the stabilty remains an issue. If you keep your hands stable, the pictures can turn out to be nice. The selfie camera performs decently. It captures fairly accurate skin tone, but sometimes the camera tends to soften the skin tone, meaning your pimples and blemishes will all be hidden by the camera. Should you buy the Realme GT 6T? My experience with the Realme GT 6T has been positive. It’s a phone that offers flagship-level performance at a more accessible price point of Rs 32,999. The combination of its powerful Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 chipset, stunning display, sleek design, and long-lasting battery makes it a top contender in the mid-range smartphone market. There are a few hiccups here and there but nothing that cannot be overlooked. And if you can shell out a little more money, with bank offers included, you can get the Realme GT 6 at a starting price of Rs 35,999, that will offer a more powerful chipset, AI features, and a really good battery."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story OpenAI CTO was recently at her alma mater, Dartmouth Engineering, where she talked at length about the future of artificial intelligence, the next generation of ChatGPT, and its PhD-level intelligence. Murati says that GPT-3 had toddler-level intelligence, GPT-4 had the intelligence of a high-schooler, and the next generation of the model will have the intelligence of someone with a PhD for specific tasks. She also revealed that the next generation of GPT can be expected in “a year and a half”. She even said that when you have a conversation with the next-gen chatbot, in a lot of things you might feel like it’s smarter than you. The interview moderator, Jefferey Blackburn, who is a Dartmouth Trustee, asked Murati the question we have all been asking ourselves: What if three years from now, when the GPT becomes unbelievably intelligent, it just decides it wants to connect to the internet on its own and start doing things. Is that real, and is that something you're thinking about as the CTO of OpenAI? “Yes, we're thinking a lot about this. It's definitely real that you'll have AI systems that will have agent capabilities, connect to the internet, talk to each other, agents connecting to each other and doing tasks together, or agents working with humans and collaborating seamlessly. So sort of working with AI like we work with each other today,” she says. “In terms of safety, security, the societal impacts of this work, I think these things are not an afterthought. It can be that you sort of develop the technology and then you have to figure out how to deal with these issues. You kind of have to build them alongside the technology and actually in a deeply embedded way to get it right. And for capabilities and safety, they're actually not separate domains. They go hand in hand. It's much easier to direct a smarter system by telling it, okay, just don't do these things. They need to direct a less intelligent system. It's sort of like training a smarter dog versus a dumber dog, and so intelligence and safety go hand in hand,” Murati adds. Essentially, the OpenAI CTO says that future AI systems will be able to connect to the internet, interact with each other, and collaborate with humans. However, she highlights that smarter AI systems are easier to control and direct safely. Meanwhile, Murati also said that “it is not possible to have zero risks” when it comes to a technology like AI. Addressing a question about deep fake videos, she says while the responsibility is OpenAI’s because the technology belongs to them, the onus also falls on the user, the civil society, the government, and content creators. “It's our responsibility how it's used, but it's also shared responsibility with society, civil society, government, content makers, media, and so on, to figure out how it's used”. The biggest impact of ChatGPT was making AI known to everyone. It showed people what AI can do and what its risks are. It's different to read about AI than to actually use it in your business. When you try it, you see its limits but also its amazing abilities, helping you understand what it means for your work or business, said Murati. But if we talk about the biggest impact of AI, in general, on industries, Murati believes it will “affect everything”. “There's not going to be an area that won't be [impacted], in terms of cognitive work and cognitive labour. Maybe it's going to take a little bit longer to get into the physical world, but I think everything will be impacted by it,” she believes. As for jobs, Murati believes some will definitely be impacted, especially “some creative jobs”, but she also believes these would be the ones that “shouldn’t have been there in the first place”. The OpenAI CTO says that the next generation of AI will lower the barrier of “creativity” so that it will no longer be limited to only the “talented people”. AI will make everyone more creative. Which is why, certain jobs that were limited to only a select few creative people will just be taken over by AI."

    "article_content": "Listen to Story (NOTE: This article was published in the INDIA TODAY edition dated June 24, 2024) Foreign policy has been regarded as an area of success for the Narendra Modi–led NDA government since 2014—a sign of a confident India asserting itself on the global stage. No passage of events proved it more effectively than how New Delhi steered deep functional ties with both the United States and Russia, without one jeopardising the other. Its presidency of the G20 also saw India renew its old role as a leading voice of the Global South. New Delhi’s diplomatic skills were again on view this February, when the ministry secured a pardon for eight former Indian naval officers held on death row in Qatar. Closer home, as Pakistan extended an olive branch on the occasion of Modi’s oath-taking on June 9, India stayed firm on its stand of peace being contingent on cessation of terror. India’s ties with Russia, an old ally and a major source of energy, are seemingly at odds with its growing strategic alliance with the US. Balancing ‘principles’ with ‘interests’, India resisted US-NATO pressure to condemn Russia at the UN. In late 2023, external affairs minister Jaishankar visited Moscow to reaffirm “strong and steady” ties, signing deals on trade, energy, security and a nuclear plant. While relations with Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar are under control, Maldives along with Pakistan is the only other nation with an ‘unfriendly’ posture. The BJP’s manifesto also talks about preparing the diplomatic groundwork for the Maritime India Vision (SAGAR) and the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) to promote India’s trade interests. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE Strategic partnerships Deepening economic, technological, defence cooperation with the US and EU. Enhance collaboration with Quad partners Japan, Australia and the US for regional security and economic stability in the Indo-Pacific. Neighbourhood First policy Strengthening SAARC and BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) to foster economic/ security cooperation. Through Act East Policy, boosting trade, investment and cultural ties with Southeast Asian nations. Engaging with China Continuing the diplomatic and military dialogue with China to resolve the border dispute, defuse tension on the LAC. UN reforms Pushing for the long overdue expansion of the UN Security Council; leverage India’s standing in the Global South to address economic disparities and promote inclusive growth; lead global efforts to combat climate change and promote sustainable development. Counter-terrorism Enhance intelligence-sharing and joint operations with international allies and participate in global counter-terrorism initiatives. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Is India indeed headed towards democratic decay? If so, how will it chart a revival? What does Bharat Ratna recipient Karpoori Thakur’s legacy mean in today’s politics? Three new political books attempt some answers. The Republic Relearnt, Renewing Indian Democracy (1947-2024) By Radha Kumar Penguin Vintage, 2024 This analysis of India’s ‘democratic decay’ suggests that the Narendra Modi government has led the nation towards a ‘second republic’ by stealth. In a recent interview, Kumar minced no words in describing the prime minister as a ‘textbook autocrat’ who is set on a totalitarian path. Yet this book looks to the past for hope, sketching three earlier phases of ‘democracy renewal’ in 1977-80, 1989-98 and 2004-14 as portents that a fourth such ‘wave’ must be in store. Kumar suggests that the democratic challenge will come from the states, and given her chronology, the new coalitional compulsions facing Modi 3.0 must have quickened her quiet optimism. At the Heart of Power: The Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh By Shyamlal Yadav Rupa, 2024 Uttar Pradesh may not be a microcosm of the country, but if any state determines the political fortunes of the Centre, it is this. Veteran journalist Shyamlal Yadav’s timely book is a breezy compendium of the lives and times of the state’s 21 chief ministers, from G.B. Pant to Yogi Adityanath, and the shifting political fortunes they represent. Lest we forget: two of these chief ministers would go on to serve as prime minister. Yadav carries his grasp of the state’s political and social intricacies lightly, and the eventful careers of these often-colourful politicians makes this a fast-paced read. The Jannayak, Karpoori Thakur: Voice of the Voiceless By Santosh Singh and Aditya Anmol Penguin Vintage, 2024 This biography of the two-term Bihar chief minister and recent (and very posthumous) Bharat Ratna recipient Karpoori Thakur (1924-1988) is a deep dive into political history as well as a reminder of a defining period in Indian politics, the original dawn of coalition governments in the 1970s. The continuing relevance or resonance of Thakur’s legacy has much to do with the Lohiya-ite socialist’s role in ‘bifurcating’ reservation for OBC, EBC, EWS and women, prefiguring the later Mandal reforms. This somewhat worshipful account is enlivened with reminiscences from Thakur’s many political heirs including Lalu Prasad Yadav, and Nitish Kumar. A standout is the chapter on Thakur’s language politics—his fondness for Hindi, Bhojpuri and Maithili and his famous decision to ‘decolonise’ the curriculum by dropping English as a compulsory high school subject.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story (NOTE: This is a reprint of a story that was published in the India Today Spice edition dated May 2024) Morocco simmers, stews, and sizzles, in imagination, literature, and reel much as it does on the magical streets of its charming cities. With its epic landscapes and ancient mystique, it makes for prime road trip territory. This is where our journey unfolded; an experience that transcended mere travel to venture into the realm of the unforgettable. The idea: to odyssey through the vibrant landscapes and cultural tapestry of this ancient land in the Mercedes-Benz GLS. With the vehicles working not just as transport but as companions in a voyage of discovery and indulgence, we began our journey at Marrakesh with a grand welcome at Hotel La Mamounia. As the sun began its descent over the enchanting city of Marrakesh, the legendary La Mamounia unveiled her grandeur and elegance in true Moorish style with intricate detailing and unabashed opulence. Tucked away within acres of verdant gardens, our picture-perfect lavish accommodations came with panoramic views of the sprawling greens. If that wasn’t a sight for sore eyes, exquisite massages at the tranquil spa, followed by equally decadent dining options definitely were. Marrakesh to Dades—A landscape on the pages of history As the first light of dawn painted the sky pink and gold, the gleaming fleet of Mercedes-Benz GLS vehicles embarked on the first leg of our adventure, weighted by anticipation and possibility. The leisurely drive through the winding streets of Marrakesh—bustling souks, the Jemaa el-Fnaa square, and the kaleidoscope of colours that adorned every corner—was a momentary lull compared to the grandiose vistas and drive terrain offered by the majestic Atlas mountains. The Mercedes-AMG GLS 63 has been groomed to precisely negotiate this kind of rugged terrain with ease, its all-wheel drive and adaptive suspension ensuring a smooth and comfortable ride. Our journey was punctuated by historic landmarks and scenic viewpoints, where ancient architecture and panoramic vistas sat cheek by jowl to entice and excite. Lunch was at Hassan, nestled cosily in the lap of the mountains. After our sumptuous lunch, we embarked on a thrilling drive deeper into the heart of the High Atlas Mountains. As we ascended, the distant peaks that still retained traces of winter, shimmered in the distance with snowy patches. The Mercedes-AMG GLS 63 navigated the challenging terrain with confidence, its powerful 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine and responsive handling making light work of the steep inclines and hairpin bends. The active roll stabilization and AMG RIDE CONTROL+ suspension provided additional stability and comfort on the uneven roads. As the afternoon sun dipped below the horizon, we arrived at Hotel Xaluca in Dades, a luxurious retreat perched in the Dades Valley. Even though the rooms at Hotel Xaluca Dades were a delightful blend of traditional Moroccan décor and modern amenities, what I really wanted was to sink into clean sheets and a soft bed, 1,000 thread count cotton notwithstanding. Dades to Merzouga—A passage through time and terrain Dawn departures are almost de rigueur on any road trip, and this one was no different. With the desert sands of Merzouga beckoning in the distance, the wheels of the Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 4MATIC tuned magic on its head as we savored the luxurious comfort and refined performance as we traversed the starkly beautiful landscape. The Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600’s advanced air suspension made for an exceptionally smooth ride over the undulating terrain, while its opulent interior, complete with high-quality diamond-pattern quilting and ambient lighting, kept us in utmost comfort. The rear-seat passengers enjoyed the MBUX Multi-Seat Entertainment system, which offers a comprehensive range of infotainment and comfort features, including the “Hey Mercedes” voice assistant. Lunch was at Auberge Meteroid in Alnif, where the tantalizing aromas promised a culinary adventure almost as exciting as our wheeled one. As we made our way towards Merzouga, the landscape transformed, making way for the endless expanse of the Sahara Desert. Here, amidst the shifting sands and vast dunes, the Mercedes-Benz GLS 580 proved its mettle, effortlessly gliding over the desert terrain with grace and precision. With shifting sands on cue, and a GLS within your grip, dune bashing comes with the territory. The powerful engine of the GLS, and the agile handling it allows made it almost easy to subdue the sandy terrain. The advanced all-wheel drive system provided superior traction and stability, ensuring we could navigate the dunes with ease and confidence. As we soared over the towering dunes, the exhilaration of the experience was matched only by the awe-inspiring beauty of the desert landscape stretching out before us. It was a moment of pure adrenaline—an unforgettable highlight of our journey through the Sahara Desert. With the desert in all its golden glory, could an oasis be far behind? Hotel Riad Xaluca is a rich nod to the cultural heritage of the region. As the sounds painted our backdrop, we dined on sumptuous dishes prepared with locally sourced ingredients, savouring each bite as the sun disappeared behind the dunes. With an adventurous day behind us and a cool evening ahead, spent lounging in the infinity pool, luxury was a foregone conclusion. Much like with great food, memories from the road continue to haunt long after the char has scorched the tar. Until we meet again, Morocco, you will always hold a special place in our hearts.

    "article_content": "Listen to Story During the 10 years of the Narendra Modi government, the average number of train accidents has been 68 per year, a steep decline from the average 171 mishaps per year during the preceding decade-long rule of the United Progressive Alliance. But tell that to 11-year-old Sristi. On June 17, she lost her 31-year-old father, Shubhajit Mali, when a goods train rammed into the stationary Kanchanjunga Express near New Jalpaiguri in West Bengal. Mali was taking the train home to celebrate his daughter’s birthday. The safety figures, charts and graphs, churned out by some Rail Bhawan babu for his political bosses after every train accident, mean little to the families that are suddenly left without a son, father, husband or breadwinner. ‘Human error’, again? Ten people died in the accident. That includes Anil Kumar, driver of the container goods train that crashed into the Kanchanjunga Express, and a guard of the passenger train. Kumar’s employer, the Indian Railways, is blaming him for the accident. He had apparently not adhered to the established safety protocols. Kumar, of course, is not there to defend himself or tell his side of the story. But his peers in the railway unions have taken it upon themselves to clear his name. “It is not proper for the railways to blame the driver and tarnish his name when he laid down his life while discharging his duties,” says Shiv Gopla Mishra, general secretary of the All India Railwaymen’s Federation. Whichever way the probe goes, there perhaps couldn’t have been a worse start to Ashwini Vaishnaw’s second stint as railways minister in the third term of the Narendra Modi government. The myriad rail safety figures circulated by his ministry, and also the top offices of the government, window-dress a crucial data point: number of lives lost. Last year, train accidents in India killed over 300 people, among the highest in a year. The gory images of two trains lying derailed after the June 2023 collision in Odisha’s Balasore are still vivid in memory. That accident, one of the deadliest in recent history, alone killed 296 people. A lot of sound-bytes were expended at that time about drilling a hard lesson into those running the world’s fourth-largest railway system so that such tragedies never recur. The fate of railway inquiries Railway rules say even if one person dies in an accident, a full-blown probe by the Commissioner of Rail Safety (CRS) kicks in automatically. These rules were framed eons ago to imply that even one life lost in a train accident was unacceptable. But has the current crop of railway officers learnt anything? Cut to 2024. The CRS report into last October’s derailment of the Northeast Express in Bihar’s Raghunathpur is with the Railway Board. Five people died in that accident. The probe puts the blame squarely on shortcomings in maintenance of tracks, leading to the derailment. It also calls for action against senior divisional officers in charge of keeping the tracks in shape. It’s been months but nothing has happened. The railway ministry did not reply to a query from INDIA TODAY. But sources say now, turning the matter into a departmental fight, a section of the engineering wing is vying to challenge the CRS findings. It is not surprising, then, that moments after the Kanchanjunga Express accident, social media platforms started throwing up old videos of Vaishnaw explaining the virtues of the Kavach automatic train protection system. Holding two models of Vande Bharat trains, Vaishnaw is seen in the video explaining how Kavach automatically applies the brakes and averts collision—even from the rear. In the context of the mishap, though, it seems like cruel joke, commented some social media users. So, what happened to Kavach, supposed to be India’s answer to train collisions? So far, only 1,465 route km and only 121 locomotives have adopted the system. A wider rollout across the network, it seems, is taking its own sweet time even though there is no dearth of funds or political backing. What happened on June 17? The June 17 accident was so severe that several coaches of the Kanchanjunga Express derailed, trapping passengers and necessitating a large-scale rescue operation. Emergency services rushed to the scene to extricate the injured and provide medical aid. Vaishnaw, along with senior Railway Board officials, promptly reached the site. Initial investigations point to a troubling oversight on the part of the container train’s driver Kumar, who was driving through the stretch near Rangapani station in the middle of a failure in the Automatic Signalling System, a situation that brings into effect a special safety protocol of train operations. According to railway safety protocols, in the event of an automatic signal failure, a driver is required to proceed with extreme caution, maintaining a speed limit of 10-15 kmph. Additionally, the driver must halt at each red signal momentarily before proceeding. Preliminary findings suggest these protocols were not adhered to, resulting in the goods train making a Signal Passed at Danger (SPAD) violation and ultimately colliding with the Kanchanjunga Express. Data shows six other trains had passed through Rangapani station before the goods train, with all their drivers adhering to the safety rules. The Kanchanjunga Express too had stopped before the red signal ahead when the goods train rammed into it. Safety a systemic lapse It all echoes a similar train tragedy last October in Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh, where a collision resulted in the death of two loco pilots and 13 passengers. Train safety experts have repeatedly warned that systemic issues within the Indian Railways need urgent attention. The recurring nature of such accidents suggests a deeper problem related to the implementation and monitoring of safety protocols. The lack of stringent accountability mechanisms contributes to these preventable tragedies. The CRS has launched an investigation into the Kanchanjunga Express accident. But CRS investigations, although thorough, often result in recommendations that are not always acted upon with the urgency they deserve. The inaction stems from the fact that the final authority to accept and implement the recommendations lies with the railways itself. The situation underscores a wider problem: the railways acting as both the perpetrator as well as the judge, jury and executioner in these matters. What next? The Kanchanjunga Express collision is the first major train accident after the Modi government assumed office for its third term, having ended the previous tenure as one of the worse years for rail safety in recent times. Admittedly, much investment has gone into upgrading safety in the past five years. The Centre set up the Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) in 2017-18 with a corpus of Rs 1 lakh crore for five years, for replacement, renewal and upgrade of critical safety assets. From 2017-18 to 2021-22, a gross expenditure of Rs 1.08 lakh crore was incurred on RRSK work. In 2022-23, the government extended RRSK for another five years with a gross budgetary support of Rs 45,000 crore. However, all this matters little if precious lives continue to be lost in tragedy after tragedy. For Vaishnaw and his team, then, railway safety remains one of the biggest challenges going forward, even as the railways eyes feathers in the cap such as rollout of the first bullet train corridor between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. Compounding the challenge is the vastness of the network—approximately 68,000 route km. While a lot of work has been done on the safety front, gaps remain. Rapid implementation of technology to reduce ‘human error’ holds the key to putting the railways’ safety record on track. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story For Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) supremo K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), verbal aggression has served as a time-tested strategy to obfuscate issues and score brownie points. Not quite so anymore, with the Congress government in Telangana pointing out that ‘hasty’ power purchase agreements (PPAs) struck by the previous BRS regime with Chhattisgarh, soon after the party came to power in 2014, had crippled the state’s power utilities financially. The state government is to submit evidence on the Chhattisgarh PPAs to the Justice L. Narasimha Reddy Commission of Inquiry (CoI), which is probing alleged irregularities in purchase of power as well as construction of the Bhadradiri and Yadadri power stations during the BRS regime, detailing how the fledgling state had suffered losses to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore. This is in the wake of KCR, in a sensational move, targeting the CoI on June 15, and even asking the former chief justice of the Patna High Court to step down. In a 12-page written reply to the notice served by the CoI, KCR called Narasimha Reddy’s approach “biased” with “preconceived notions” and asked him to recuse himself from heading the panel. KCR also dubbed the CoI illegal and claimed it had no authority to look into PPAs and power plant construction issues approved by the Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission (TSERC). “If the political considerations of the current ruling party are unfortunate, more painful are your unbridled comments as chairman of the Commission of Inquiry at a press conference. Before completing the inquiry, your act of calling for a press conference, taking the name of Telangana and my name and extending the time for submitting the reply in view of the Lok Sabha elections as a personal favour have caused extreme pain to me,” wrote KCR in the scathing attack. Those heading a CoI interacting with the media is not new. In the Telangana region itself, back in the 1970s, former Allahabad High Court judge Vasishta Bhargava, probing the alleged extra-judicial killings of left-wing extremists by the police during the Emergency, had invited mediapersons to accompany as he went to a site in the Giriyanapalli forests in Medak where Naxalites had allegedly been tied to trees and shot dead. ]In a point-by-point rebuttal to the allegations levelled against the BRS government, KCR explained how the power sector in Telangana was in serious crisis at the time of formation of the state. He said the then Union government had incorporated the power share in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act by considering the power consumption statistics of five years prior to the bifurcation of undivided Andhra. According to the Act, Telangana was to get 53.89 per cent and Andhra Pradesh 46.11 per cent. The ratio was to be followed for the next 10 years—in effect till 2024. However, the power share allocated to Telangana was insufficient. Even considering the power allocated, there was a shortfall of nearly 2,700 MW. To worsen the situation, Andhra did not supply over 1,500 MW, violating the AP Reorganisation Act’s provisions. Also, with non-availability of 900 MW of power from gas-based stations, Telangana suffered a deficit of 2,400 MW. On the whole, there was a shortage of nearly 5,000 MW, leading to a severe crisis in Telangana. In this backdrop, the power utilities and the Telangana government worked in unison to tide over the crisis, and as a result, the installed capacity, which stood at 7,778 MW, went up to 20,000 MW. Strengthening of the power distribution system led to Telangana being the only state in the country to supply quality power 24/7 to all sectors. If the per capita power consumption in Telangana stood at 1,196 units in 2014, it shot up to 2,349 units in just a decade. KCR claimed that his government had signed the memorandum of understanding with Chhattisgarh as Telangana was in dire need of power. But officials explained that the government had ended up paying more than the market rate. Telangana power distribution companies had to contract a transmission corridor through the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) for getting 1,000 MW from Chhattisgarh. However, on June 18, documents shared with the media showed that the PPAs with Chhattisgarh had not been ratified and sanctioned by the TSERC. Whether power flows or not, the cost of Rs 638 crore was paid to PGCIL without power supply from Chhattisgarh. It also compelled Telangana power utilities to purchase electricity from the open market for an additional Rs 2,083 crore. Later, a dispute sprang between the states on power dues. While the BRS government said it owed only Rs 1,081 crore to Chhattisgarh, the latter claimed Telangana owed Rs 1,715 crore as arrears, for which it has approached the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity. What was anticipated to be a cost-saving measure in buying power ended as a drain on the state exchequer. Official sources said the previous BRS government signed PPAs without inviting tenders, resulting in a huge financial loss to the state exchequer. Though the BRS government had signed an agreement to buy electricity at Rs 3.90 per unit, the actual financial implications have far exceeded the cost. Effectively, it cost the state Rs 5.64 per unit. Further, the sources said that the TSERC had not given the go-ahead for these PPAs, raising questions about its legality besides financial prudence. In turn, this resulted in the demand to classify the payments made to Chhattisgarh as “irregularities”. KCR has also accused Congress chief minister A. Revanth Reddy of ordering the probe “with a clear political motive to discredit the earlier government”. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee working president and MLC Mahesh Kumar Goud has challenged KCR to substantiate his claims before the CoI. In yet another challenge, BJP leader and Union minister of state for home affairs Bandi Sanjay Kumar asked KCR to take the matter to court if he believed that the CoI was acting illegally. He also demanded transparency regarding allegations of corruption in procurement processes, questioning: “If there was no corruption, then why not explain the facts about PPAs.” “There was evidence of KCR’s willingness to go to any lengths to cover up mistakes and irregularities,” he alleged. On all this, the BRS chief is silent. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story The BJP in Rajasthan is staring at a massive upheaval as discontent starts to come out into the open after the party’s dismal performance in the general elections, wherein it lost 11 seats compared to the 25-0 sweep in 2019 and 2014. Over the past few days, deliberations have been held to review the setback—chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 17. However, what has stolen the limelight is veteran BJP leader Devi Singh Bhati’s take on the losses. On June 17, after the BJP state unit was done with two days of discussions, Bhati blamed flawed ticket distribution, inertness in the organisation and former leader of the Opposition Rajendra Rathore denying candidatures to the deserving for the poor showing. Bhati may have made some valid points. In the assembly polls last year, Rathore had blamed his defeat from Tarangar seat to sabotage by Lok Sabha MP Rahul Kaswan. In this general election, Rathore ensured Kaswan, a two-time MP from Churu, did not get a ticket. This prompted Kaswan to join the Congress and win from Churu. Kaswan’s was the only Jat family the BJP had with clout among Jat voters in the Shekhawati region. His father Ram Singh Kaswan too was a successful leader, having won assembly and Lok Sabha polls a couple of times. Rathore, at one point, was seen as very close to Ram Singh. After their falling out, he ensured Ram Singh did not get a Lok Sabha poll ticket in 2014; his son was fielded as a compromise candidate. Thereafter, Rathore began losing Jat votes, and Kaswan’s ill-treatment in this election is thought to have drifted Jat voters away from the BJP in every Jat-dominated seat beyond Shekhawati. BJP insiders say that former chief minister Vasundhara Raje, who had succeeded in the difficult task of taking Rajputs and Jats along, had wanted a say in a couple of seats—Kaswan’s being one of them. Raje had also suggested that Pralhad Gunjal be fielded from Tonk-Sawai Madhopur to keep the Gurjar vote intact, but the party did not pay heed. Gunjal shifted to the Congress and put up a really hard fight against the BJP’s Om Birla in the Kota-Bundi seat. After Bhati’s statement, Rathore met Union home minister Amit Shah on June 18. Insiders say most state leaders are likely to shift the blame for the reverses on Raje. This even as Rajasthan heads for five assembly bypolls since some non-BJP MLAs have been elected as MPs. Even BJP ministers in Rajasthan are going public on the state unit’s failures. Agriculture minister Kirodi Lal Meena has not been attending office or using his official vehicle ever since the Lok Sabha results were declared, saying he is not keen to continue as a minister under the current circumstances. He feels the party in Rajasthan is in the hands of inexperienced and incompetent leaders, who are neither letting the alleged corruption during the erstwhile Congress regime being investigated nor displaying any vision to woo voters. Urban development minister Jhabar Singh Kharra has said the party failed to prevent ‘common cold from turning into pneumonia’, blaming the losses on wrong ticket distribution and the failure to counter the Congress. That the BJP could not perform as expected in the assembly and now the Lok Sabha elections calls for some urgent introspection. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader Indresh Kumar chose to blame arrogance in the BJP ranks for the poor show in Jaipur. Clearly, the malaise in the Rajasthan BJP is deeper than what the party may want to believe. With leaders’ patience waning, it’s open season for dissidence. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story (NOTE: This article was originally published in the India Today issue dated June 24, 2024) This financial year had started on a tepid note, with India’s merchandise exports rising only 1 per cent—to around $35 billion (Rs 2.92 lakh crore)—in April, compared to the same month last year. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war along with other geopolitical tensions, such as the Red Sea crisis and the Israel-Hamas conflict, also contributed to making the international trade scenario even tougher for Indian exporters. Despite all this, businesses are living in the hope that exports will start showing better growth numbers with improved demand from the European Union, the UK, West Asia and the US. Order bookings from these regions are up 10 per cent, claims the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), which is a sign of recovery for labour-intensive sectors, including leather and leather products, footwear and apparel. Experts also believe that the tariff war between the US and China could open new windows of opportunity for India’s export sector. However, there is a dire need to boost merchandise exports. India’s overall exports grew marginally to $778 billion (Rs 64.99 lakh crore) in FY24 from $776.3 billion (Rs 64.85 lakh crore) the previous fiscal. But, of this, merchandise exports, which form the major chunk, recorded a 3 per cent decline from $451 billion (Rs 37.63 lakh crore) to $437 billion (Rs 36.46 lakh crore). Services exports fared better, rising by nearly 5 per cent and acting as the key driver of growth. A comprehensive road map to boost merchandise exports is expected to be chalked out this term to address this major concern, aligning with the target of $1 trillion exports in the sector by 2030. The other key area to be addressed is the signing of the free trade agreement (FTA) with Oman, talks for which had concluded earlier this year. There could be a delay in signing the FTA with the UK though, since it is heading for election in July. Negotiations for similar agreements with the European Union and Peru could also continue, while talks with the South African Customs Union (SACU), Chile and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are slated to take place over the next few months. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE Address liquidity issues In such challenging times, both the flow of credit to and the cost of credit for exporters have to be addressed. While the commodities and freight prices have gone up amid a global slowdown and geopolitical tensions, clients are taking longer to make payments. Exporters need to get larger sums of credit, that too for a longer duration. Extend interest subvention Providing loans at cheaper rates to eligible businesses, it is one of the most effective instruments to remove cost disability of Indian exports at a time when bank rates in India are far higher than in competitor economies. When the overall interest rates came down, the Centre also reduced the interest subvention (assistance) for exporters. Now that the repo rate has risen to 6.5 per cent, the subvention rates should be restored to what they were earlier—5 per cent for MSMEs and 3 per cent for labour-intensive sectors—so that exporters can commit to long-term contracts. Facilitate better marketing Small and medium enterprises do not have the financial wherewithal to showcase themselves globally. The total marketing support corpus is now a miniscule Rs 200 crore, nowhere near the 0.5 per cent of the total exports that businesses have demanded. For around $800 billion (Rs 66.83 lakh crore) worth of exports, it means setting aside $4 billion (Rs 33,400 crore) for marketing. Trade connect In January, Piyush Goyal had announced the initiation of work on an e-platform to help Indian exporters connect with international buyers. A welcome step, the Trade Connect platform should be launched soon. Finalise FTAs India is expected to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with Oman in the first 100 days of Modi 3.0. Other FTAs need to be expedited too, including the ones with the UK, Peru, and the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union. The last will provide India access to markets in five resource-rich post-Soviet economies. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

All the accused being members of one religious group, the action has come under question by some. Mandla district magistrate Saloni Sidana said information was received about an illegal abattoir operating in Bhainswahi village in Nainpur tehsil in the district. A search carried out at the premises yielded bones, skin, meat and implements used in killing animals. The 11 suspects have been booked under the MP Cow Slaughter Prevention Act. One of them has been arrested while the others are on the run. Mandla superintendent of police Rajat Saklecha told INDIA TODAY that a preliminary report by a local vet had confirmed the meat and bones to be of a cow. Samples had been sent to a laboratory in Hyderabad for a definitive result, he added. Saklecha said police were investigating how cows were being procured for slaughtering. According to him, the accused in police custody had informed that the hides of the dead animals were sold to leather units and the meat to buyers in neighbouring districts. The families of the accused are crying foul that no notice was served before the demolitions. “We have been living here for almost 30 years. We did not get any notice before the demolition and a lot of our household goods have been destroyed,” said the wife of one of the accused. The spouse of one of the absconding suspects rued: “We have nowhere to go and no household goods left to carry on with our lives.” Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story Tall, stately, handsome on the outside. Soft, humourous, happy on the inside. A genial soul, a good guru and family man. Bharatanatyam expert C.V. Chandrasekhar combined many traits in one, effortlessly. He lived a life of 89 years full of dance colours; no wonder one found him in attractive and unusual coloured kurtas in public. Neatly combed hair and a ready radiance were his hallmarks. It is his overall aesthetics and dance stamina that inspired many. When he took to the stage and did a tillana or a varnam, he could put a 30-year-old to shame. His art sprang from discipline and dedication. Meet the redoubtable guru C.V. Chandrasekhar, popularly known as ‘Chandru Anna’. Born in Simla on May 22, 1935, where his father Rao Sahib (a title given by Britishers) V.A.V. Iyer, who was in government service under British India, and mother Kamala were stationed, Chandru Anna was among the eight siblings—two sisters and six brothers. As he was number seven, he was considered lucky! The early years were spent in Simla and Delhi. There was no dance in the family, though like in most South Indian families, Carnatic music was learnt and appreciated. His father was not happy with the Delhi culture and wrote to Madurai Subramanya Iyer regarding his lucky number seven son imbibing the arts properly. Subramanya Iyer recommended Kalakshetra in Madras. Thus, Chandru Anna found himself at Kalakshetra in 1945, where he stayed for nine years, till 1954. In the first year, he learnt only music from T.K. Ramasami Iyengar. It was only in 1946 that dance training began. Peria Sarda and Dandayudhapani Pillai were his teachers. When his father retired in 1947 on April 1 (four months before Independence), the family shifted to Coimbatore. Along with dance, Chandru Anna went through normal education, finished his high school in 1950 and BSc in 1954 from the Vivekananda College, all along pursuing dance at Kalakshetra. MSc followed, though in Benaras, and he finished with that in 1956. During this period of study, he had two significant opportunities: to visit Delhi in 1954 and win the inter college competition. And go to China, selected by Sir C.P. Ramaswami Iyer, as part of a cultural troupe. He attempted Bharatanatyam to Hindustani music to even Gujarati poetry but that was to make dance more acceptable and understandable in an alien setting. \"I never compromised on its grammar or content. I broke ground with Ritu Samhara; I conquered with Bhoomija. Under my wife Jaya's banner Nrityashree, we produced Meghadootam, Aparajitha, Pancha Maha Bhootam, Aarohanam, Govinda Biridavali, Bhanvar Geet, etc.,” Chandru Anna said. All above history and facts, I sat and gleamed from him on the occasion of his 75th birthday in 2010 (shared with readers of www.narthaki.com first). His three important contributions can be summed up as giving the male solo dancer a fillip, especially when senior of age, bringing dance to academics, and academics to dance. He took pride in his daughters, saying “Chitra and Manjari are very dedicated to their profession. In spite of being trained under us, their style is very individualistic and not our replicas.” Chandru Anna was modern yet contemporary in his approach to dance. In one of my interviews, he maintained: “Changes in dance and tradition will come; what is important is to have a firm foundation. The grammar of classical dance is its soul. Just doing some new fangled stuff on stage means nothing and is hardly even remembered. The beauty and essence of Indian classical dance lies in its tradition.” “Dance is my mission. I have been given awards that I value, such as the Padma Bhushan, Kalidas Samman and the Akademi Award. My students and wider family of dance love me and that’s my biggest reward,” he said. Wherever he went all loved him. Once in a workshop in Coonoor, he sang antakshari to regale students by camp fire. He was a quintessential artiste. They don’t make like that anymore—humble, happy and humourous. Pucca, professional, personable. No wonder the gods called him to dance for them up in Devlok. Om Shanti! — The writer is India’s ace dance authority, historian, critic and editor of attenDance Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

    "article_content": "Listen to Story (NOTE: This article was originally published in the India Today issue dated Sep 21,1998) Have you ever reached the end of the road? I did, this past Sunday. It was 10.30 p.m. when the highway to Gorakhpur disappeared; literally. NH 28, which had brought me some 260 km from Lucknow, turned into a peninsula barely 10 km from Gorakhpur at Barwar, once a village. Suddenly there was nothing but the sardonic grin of the full moon above - and the swirling waters of the Rapti below. The river looked the very embodiment of tandav. Perhaps it was merely the lonely night; perhaps it was merely the policemen who told me the \"Rapti is 27 ft at the shallows\". Gorakhpur, the land of monks and mafia dons, found neither spiritual nor temporal fortification against nature, nature at its most raw. The rains had come in July; so had the floods, phase I. The second assault came in late August - and peaked on the 24th. When the clouds \"threw down their spears, Gorakhpur was an island. NH 28 had two huge gaps: one 700 m long, the other 175 m. NH 29 - the link to Varanasi, the other big city in the vicinity - had lost 550 m. Of Gorakhpur's 1,579 villages, 1,187 had been marooned. That was a fortnight ago'. That was when the waters climbed up to 10 ft in the city. That was when the spanking new planetarium was submerged - only days before its planned inauguration. That was when the Indian Air Force renewed Exercise FROG (Flood Relief Operations: Gorakhpur). That was when the army was pressed into service. That was when boats and boatmen were flown down from Varanasi and Allahabad to become Gorakhpur's improvised public transport system. It was one such boat which took me from Barwar to Gorakhpur the next morning. There were other passengers as well. Each was being charged Rs 10 by profiteering boatmen for a service which the state had provided \"free\". Yet, Barwar is lucky. At least its survivors - who live under tarpaulin sheets on the last stretches of the highway - can use the boats. 'Khanipur village hasn't seen even one. It lies - make that floats - barely 5 km from Gorakhpur and suffered collateral damage when the Nausarh bund collapsed on the evening of August 23. Khanipur's people stay on the state highway now. Since the \"waters have receded - from 9 ft to about 5 ft - the villagers are beginning to visit their homes, collecting utensils here, picking up fodder for the buffaloes there. The journey is excruciatingly slow. The 1,000 odd Khanipuris have one tube between them. The more agile can swim; others can only cling. How have they survived? Courtesy \"dayalu mahajan jinhone khana diya (generous businessmen who fed us)\". Why weren't they evacuated? Did they want to be evacuated? Not a chance. Nobody wants to leave home, not even if it's barely visible in a messy, slimy soup. As Wing Commander VS. Bharti - chief of the Daring Eagles, the unit whose Mi 8 helicopters have been deployed relentlessly in flood-relief manoeuvres - remarked, \"They just don't want to be taken away.\" There must be comfort in familiar surroundings. More cynically, there must be the belief that this too shall pass, as previous floods have in a region which is no stranger to them. Even so, this has been perhaps the century's most ferocious monsoon for Poorvanchal - as eastern Uttar Pradesh is known. In Gorakhpur, old-timers, very old-timers, talk of the deluge of 1932. The meteorological records, however, point only as far back as 1974. That was when the Rapti reached its highest mark hitherto: 76.84 m. Consequently, the bunds, roads and hutments were built keeping this benchmark in mind. On August 23 this year, the Rapti rose to 77.54 m - and all calculations went awry. Seventy centimetres: that's all it took for Gorakhpur's infrastructure to fall to pieces. It says something for 70 cm. It says even more for the infrastructure. Most local bunds are fashioned in mud - porous and easily destructible. Gorakhpur, as District Magistrate Arun Singhal tells you, has \"428 km of bunds\". To enhance them to more hardy \"boulder-lining bunds\" requires \"Rs 2 crore a km\". Yet, Gorakhpur's annual district plan is \"a mere Rs 30-40 crore\". It is so easy to smile a wry smile. Is Gorakhpur fated to be ravaged repeatedly? What do you say to the air force officer who wonders about the dehumanising process of throwing food packets at shrieking men and women day after day after day? How do you react when you're told that a local minister got his wife the contract to supply puri subzi to flood victims? Can you disagree when even government officials smirk that the preliminary estimates for repairing NHs 28 and 29 (Rs 11 crore and one month) be safely multiplied by four? Which teeth do you gnash when you hear thieves in boats helped themselves to houses as the residents sought sanctuary on the roof? There are scenes I will never forget - of that nameless little girl in Ekla village who kissed her baby brother on the embankment they rested upon. There are scenes Virendra Pande will never forget either. When the Nausarh bund fell, this farmer thought \"it was a cloudburst\". He rushed out \"to see people gripped by a terror I cannot even explain\". A petrol pump and a bridge were shattered before his eyes, the \"waters seemed to rise 25 ft\" and ripped apart the Varanasi highway. Only the great flood the holy books speak of could have done worse. Actually, let's reserve judgement on that. Gorakhpur's weather office forecasts heavy rain in late September. Perhaps the Rapti wants to overwhelm me a little more. DATELINE KAZIRANGA In her time, she must have roamed the length and breadth of Kaziranga's 430 sq km rhino country. She must also seen the disastrous floods of 1988 - and survived. But she was younger then. And stronger. After days of scouring around for food in the highlands adjoining the inundated national park, she couldn't carry her 2,000 kg frame any further. On a paddy field beside the road that she shared over her final week with flood-affected farmers, she lay down to rest on the evening of September 9. She never got up. I went to the spot early the next morning, expecting a picture of majestic death. What lay before me was just a bleeding boulder. Forest Department officials had scythed out the rhino's horn soon after it had died - to save it the indignity of being poached posthumously. Flies buzzed around the ugly wound. Children climbed onto its massive grey back. And Ganesh Ghatowar, the owner of the 4 cottah (3,000 sq ft) patch of paddy had a mundane - but eminently valid - complaint: \"Who's going to move this thing?\" Before the stench rises, forest officials say, they'll have to go to work on it with their saws. The cadaver will be removed in manageable portions. A drive, a walk, a boat ride, and an hour later we arrive at a submerged village on the edge of Kaziranga's Baguri range. The houses are empty, the villagers having camped by the tarmac of NH37 which runs along the park. So no one is bothered by the sickening miasma that is carried across the water. It comes from what resembles a little island. It's a rhino that was found \"upstream\" by Forest Department officials and had probably starved/drowned. This is an animal, mind you, that can really swim. Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) P.S. Das had told me the previous evening that rhinos \"could swim across the Brahmaputra\" (a feat comparable to swimming the English Channel). This one was in its youth. But it was also hungry and tired. Its carcass was carried by the only force powerful enough to accomplish the task: the flood waters. As our canoe circled it, the ripples caused it to move a little. Almost as if it were alive. Macabre? Morbid? Gruesome? Call it what you will, but the word is real. And reality has hit Kaziranga hard this time. Its hog deers, wild buffaloes, elephants and rhinos have had to fight three phases of floods that began in June. The previous time I was in Kaziranga, in July, one forest official said the animals were \"angry\" because there was no food. In the first week of September, they gave up the search. Some 18 rhinos have died as a result of the floods. Another seven have been poached. With 95 per cent of the park flooded, there were very few places to hide. They were almost room service for the poachers. See this in the context of a rhino population of 1,100 in Kaziranga and a smattering of another 800-odd one-horned rhinos in other parks in Nepal and India. And you'll see that there aren't that many one-horned rhinos (African rhinos come with two horns) left in the wild. See the damage with the benefit of experience. Two successive floods in 1987 and 1988 had such an effect on the animal population that it is yet to recede. The hog deer population of Kaziranga prior to those years hovered around 11,000. Now, even after protracted recuperation, the numbers are down to the 6,000 mark. As the water goes down in Kaziranga, the stench of rotting flesh will rise. But even then we will only get a preliminary report on the damage. Nature takes its toll. It also takes it time. Locked as it is between the Brahmaputra - which resembles a muddy sea during the rains - and the hills of Karbi Anglong, Kaziranga is a flood-prone area. But its tall fleshy grass is the rhino's preferred meal. It's also a great place to stay for a number of other animals, including about 80 tigers. Its problem lies, however, in the fact that in the case of a contingency like a flood the animals are forced to migrate to the inhabited Karbi hills. This means very little suitable food and a lot of predatory humans. \"We can do very little to safeguard the animals which stray into the hills,\" says DFO Das, \"it is outside our jurisdiction.\" Moves to extend animal territory have been very slow. Of the six extensions planned for the park, only one has been completed. For the 550-odd foresters who take care of Kaziranga, this past week has been a harrowing, sleepless one. Between yawns, they complain that the damage to the park's infrastructure - roads, artificial highlands for animals, camps for forest guards - could add to the toll in the coming years. With the park under 15 ft of water in many places, several forest guards were marooned on their tree houses and actually had to be rescued. Yet the state Government's annual allocation for Kaziranga (incidentally the logo of the Assam Tourism Department is a graphic rendition of the rhino) has been reduced from Rs 80 lakh annually five years ago to close to Rs 20 lakh at present. Even Central funds manage to hibernate in the state exchequer: in August 1997, the Centre released Rs 50 lakh for the park. Kaziranga is yet to see the money. At the Kohra range office, forest officials exchange urgent wireless messages: a wild boar speared by villagers; a hog deer paralysed by the headlights of a speeding truck on the highway-and hit; a rhino carcass found. It was as a result of one such wireless exchange two months ago that a rhino calf abandoned by its mother was rescued. \"This shows how desperate the mother was. Unlike other animals, rhinos follow their young rather than the other way around,\" says Das. He reckons the calf was abandoned because the mother thought there was no way it could be saved. Because she was found \"on the waves\" the calf was christened Laharani (lahar meaning wave). She was so young that she carried the vestiges of an umbilical chord. Now she roams around the office - no more than a foot and a half high, but nevertheless very strong - among foresters who have grown increasingly attached to her. Attempts to transfer her to the Guwahati Zoo under the orphaned animals scheme have met with tearful opposition. The problem is that Laharani is a prodigious consumer of milk (about 12 litres a day) and has high medical expenses. Unfortunately, tears won't pay for these requirements. Sometime in the near future, Laharani will have to go because the Forest Department cannot afford her upkeep. As I felt the hard surface of a nascent horn on her head, I wondered where it might end up if she is sent back to the flood-prone grasslands of Kaziranga. Two images came to mind. A disembodied horn in the Golaghat district treasury after an \"unnatural death\". Or in the dust of some oriental aphrodisiac. Subscribe to India Today Magazine"

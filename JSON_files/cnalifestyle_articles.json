One of Singapore’s last licensed itinerant hawkers, Ng Teak Boon, has died at the age of 92. He was cremated on Saturday (Jun 22) without a wake. Known affectionately as Uncle Boon, Ng was a well-known sight outside Sim Lim Tower, where he had been selling old-school ice cream blocks from a mobile pushcart for over 50 years. The news of Ng's passing was first announced by hawker Melvin Chew on the Facebook group Hawkers United - Dabao 2020 . Earlier this year, Ng told 8days.sg that due to age, he had been unable to sell his wafer and bread-wrapped ice cream blocks as he no longer had the strength to split the frozen blocks. Instead, he offered pre-packaged ice cream from a supplier. As ice cream pushcarts became a dying trade, Ng’s sales gradually dwindled over the years. He earned a few hundred dollars a month selling ice cream, and lived alone in a one-room rental flat in Geylang Bahru. When his income took a huge hit during the Circuit Breaker when everyone stayed home, netizens rallied to help him sell more ice cream and spruce up his rental flat, which was sparsely furnished. One Mr Chetan, a business owner working in Sim Lim Tower, told 8days.sg that he had been patronising Ng’s ice cream cart since 2007. He shared: “I would always buy the ice cream from Uncle. He was always earlier than me to start [his day for business]. Very nice uncle, very humble.” This story was originally published in 8Days.

The 76th Venice Film Festival - Screening of the film \"The Burnt Orange Heresy\" out of competition - Red Carpet Arrivals - Venice, Italy, September 7, 2019 - Donald Sutherland poses. REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw/ File Photo Donald Sutherland, one of Canada's most versatile and gifted actors, who charmed and enthralled audiences in films such as M*A*S*H, Klute, Ordinary People and the Hunger Games films, has died at the age of 88. The Canadian actor, whose lengthy career spanned from the 1960s into the 2020s, died on Thursday (Jun 20), his son, actor Kiefer Sutherland, said on social media. The tall actor with a deep voice, piercing blue eyes and mischievous smile managed to switch effortlessly from character roles to romantic leads, opposite the likes of Jane Fonda and Julie Christie. He also played his share of oddballs and villains during a career that began in the 1960s. One of the biggest stars in Hollywood in the 1970s, he remained in demand for film and TV projects into his 80s. Known for his unconventional looks and his versatility as an actor, Sutherland played a wide range of memorable characters. These included a rascally Army surgeon in M*A*S*H (1970), a quirky tank commander in Kelly's Heroes (1970), a small-town detective in Klute (1971), a stoned and libidinous professor in Animal House (1978), a local official facing an alien presence in Invasion Of The Body Snatchers (1978) and a despairing father in Ordinary People (1980). He won a new generation of fans with his glorious portrayal of a despotic president in The Hunger Games (2012) and its sequels. \"I wish I could say thank you to all of the characters that I've played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life,\" Sutherland said in his speech accepting an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 2017. Sutherland was born on Jul 17, 1935, in Canada's New Brunswick province, and was raised in Nova Scotia. He performed in school productions in college, moved to Britain to hone his craft, then moved to the United States, where his first big break came as a member of a top-notch ensemble cast in the war film The Dirty Dozen (1967). He rocketed to fame three years later playing nonconformist surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in director Robert Altman's Korean War satire M*A*S*H (1970). The film – later spun off into a TV series – depicted hijinks at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, tapping into the anti-war sentiment among many Americans during the Vietnam War era. Also in 1970, Sutherland starred alongside Telly Savalas and Clint Eastwood in Kelly's Heroes as Sergeant Oddball on a mission to steal gold from the Nazis. The following year, he was paired with Fonda, one of Hollywood's luminaries, in Klute, and then in 1973 played a grieving father in Don't Look Now that included a sizzling sex scene with Christie. Klute sparked a romance with Fonda, with whom he was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement. His 1978 films could not have been more different. In the uproarious comedy Animal House, Sutherland played a professor who sleeps with the girlfriend of a fraternity member. Invasion Of The Body Snatchers was a successful sci-fi remake of a classic 1956 original, telling the story of alien pods that take over human beings. Sutherland's performance in Ordinary People, Hollywood superstar Robert Redford's directorial debut, helped the 1980 film win four Academy Awards including best picture. Sutherland starred alongside Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton in this exploration of the splintering of a Midwestern family. In the 1990s he appeared in films including JFK (1991), Backdraft (1991), Buffy The Vampire Slayer (1992), Outbreak (1995), A Time To Kill (1996) and Instinct (1999) and won an Emmy Award for his performance in the 1995 HBO TV movie Citizen X. In the 2000s, he appeared in the acclaimed Cold Mountain (2003) and Pride & Prejudice (2005). In the Hunger Games films in the 2010s about a dystopian future in which teenagers are sent into a deadly competition as mass entertainment, he reveled in playing the villainous President Coriolanus Snow. \"The reality was he had a country to run. At least he was running it, which is more than you can say for some people,\" Sutherland told the Los Angeles Times in 2017. \"It was funny at the beginning with The Hunger Games' to walk through an airport and suddenly you feel this tug and you look down and it's some young person – always a girl, never a boy,\" Sutherland said. \"And her mother is standing there and they say, 'Could you take a photograph with my daughter?' And we'd be standing beside each other and I'd be looking at the camera and the girl would say, 'Could you look mean?'\" Sutherland was considered among the best actors to never receive an Academy Award nomination for any of his roles. He was married three times and had five children, including Kiefer. Copyright© Mediacorp 2024. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

Former presidential candidate Mr Ng Kok Song explains his approach to longevity in a viral TikTok video. (Photo: TikTok/ngkoksongofficial) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Former presidential candidate Mr Ng Kok Song’s “formula” for longevity has taken to the global stage in a massively viral TikTok video. A video posted by Ng on his TikTok account on Aug 13 titled The Secret To Staying Healthy At 75 details his approach to staying mentally and physically fit in the later stages of life. “I have a formula, and the formula has got this acronym called Shield,” Ng begins in the clip uploaded about four weeks after he announced his presidential bid. “S: Sleep. Seven hours,” explains the 75-year-old former chief investment officer of sovereign wealth fund GIC. “H: How to handle stress?” he continues, citing meditation as an example. Ng explains that “I” stands for “interaction”, and promotes engaging in conversations and building relationships. “What’s the E? Exercise,” Ng says, “Every day I either play a bit of tennis, a bit of golf. Nine holes of golf, I walk the course. I try to swim, and I do gardening.” “Just do a bit of each, every day,” he adds. Ng then reveals that he had been picking up video editing skills as an example of “L” for ‘learn”. As for “D”, Ng highlights the importance of regulating one’s “diet”, such as through the moderation of carbohydrate intake. “Low sugar, and plenty of fruits and vegetables,” he concludes. The video has attained international virality, attracting more than 3.6 million views, 162,000 likes, and 1,428 comments as of Thursday (Nov 2) afternoon, and was featured on overseas media outlets recently, such as Daily Mail in the United Kingdom and other lifestyle content sites. Many comments on the video, mostly from users who appear to be outside of Singapore, thanked Ng for his succinct, yet valuable advice. Interestingly, most of the commentors did not seem to be aware of his presidential bid or background, which were also not mentioned at all in the Daily Mail report. One TikTok user wrote: “Better than a doctor’s visit!” “Awesome lifestyle from a prominent senior citizen. Follow his advice for healthy, wealthy retirement days. Thank you, sir,” wrote another. Addressing several comments poking fun at Ng’s age, a top comment wrote: “He has a lot of good wisdom to share. I don’t know why people comment about his age like it’s a bad thing.” After his presidential election run earlier this year, Ng appears to have kept up to these principles, as seen from his recent TikTok videos where he regularly shares life advice and documents meet-ups with friends. In another TikTok video posted on Oct 23, Ng even teases the upcoming launch of a “meditation series”, which appears to focus on meditation as a way to improve mental health. Ng had also taught Christian meditation to the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew. In an interview with New York Times in 2010, Mr Lee said that he started meditating about two to three years before after noticing that Ng looked \"completely serene\" despite his wife's death. Both Ng and his late wife meditated every day. This was later highlighted during Ng's run for the presidency, where he further encouraged youths to practise meditation to address mental health issues. Describing mental health as an issue he is “very passionate” about, Ng added that tackling youth's mental health challenges would be crucial to Singapore’s future success. In his most recent TikTok video, Ng shares a snippet of a video call with a neurology and Alzheimer’s specialist, Dr Rudolph Tanzi from Massachusetts General Hospital in the United States​​​, who first coined the Shield acronym in his research to improve cognitive function and protect against age-related decline. Ng said he had read Tanzi’s books and adapted the acronym into his lifestyle, before sharing it in his now-viral video. In the 53-second clip, Tanzi thanks Mr Ng for helping grow Shield's popularity and discusses the origins of the formula. “Shield your brain with that acronym,” Tanzi concludes. “It is heartening that so many of you guys have picked up on my version of it and helped spread this life-saving message,” Ng writes in the video captions.

Miami Beach police confirmed the arrest, but did not immediately provide any details. Scott, 33, posted his US$650 (S$880) bond, which means he will be released later Thursday, Miami-Dade County jail records show. His publicists, Jamie Sward and Alexandra Baker, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment, and jail records don't list an attorney for Scott. His agent, David Stromberg, didn't immediately respond to a message sent to his LinkedIn account. Scott, who is one of the biggest names in hip-hop and whose birth name is Jacques Webster, has more than 100 songs that made the Billboard Hot 100 and put out four singles that topped the chart: Sicko Mode, Highest In The Room, The Scotts and Franchise. Ten people were killed in a crowd surge at Scott's 2021 performance at his Astroworld Festival in Houston. Attendees were packed so tightly that many couldn't breathe or move their arms. Those killed, who ranged in age from 9 to 27, died from compression asphyxia , which an expert likened to being crushed by a car. Lawyers for the victims alleged in lawsuits that the deaths and hundreds of injuries at the concert were caused by negligent planning and a lack of concern over capacity and safety at the event. Scott, promoter Live Nation, and the others who were sued have denied these claims, saying safety was their No 1 concern. They said what happened could not have been foreseen. The final lawsuit was settled last month. After a police investigation , a grand jury declined to indict Scott, along with five others connected to the festival. Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

Actress Xiang Yun recently had a chance encounter with Lee Xianmin who played her daughter in Double Happiness. (Photos: Instagram/xiang_yun_, Mediacorp) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Those who watched the 2004 Mediacorp long-form drama Double Happiness would definitely remember child actress Lee Xianmin, who played Wen Wen, Xiang Yun's studious daughter. Well, as we all know, time flies because Xianmin, who was only 12 when she played Wen Wen, is now 32 and married. Recently, Xiang Yun took to her Instagram to share that she bumped into her on-screen daughter while out with her husband, Edmund Chen. Edmund played Xiang Yun's younger brother in the drama. Sharing a picture of herself and Edmund with Xianmin outside a restaurant in Plaza Singapura, Xiang Yun wrote: \"She's as high-achieving as she was in the drama. I rewatched Double Happiness this morning because of her and it was still as exciting as it was before.\" She also noted that the drama, which was split into two seasons, had spanned over a hundred episodes (141, to be exact), adding that she \"believes [the show] accompanied the audience through many good days too\". Many netizens were able to recognise Xianmin instantly, with some remarking that she hadn't changed a bit. A post shared by 向云Xiang Yun's Official Account (@xiang_yun_) When Chinese media zaobao.sg reached out to Xianmin, who left showbiz in 2007 when she was 15, she first shared that she got married five years ago, and now co-owns a gynaecology clinic with her friend. Xianmin studied at Raffles Girls' School and Raffles Institution before entering the National University of Singapore, where she majored in International Relations. After graduating, Xianmin worked as an assistant director at the Eco-city Project Office, under the Ministry of National Development. Xianmin also recounted her impromptu reunion with Xiang Yun and Edmund. She was having a meal with her friend, who suddenly said there were celebrities around. \"I turned my head and realised it was Edmund and Xiang Yun,\" said Xianmin. \"Maybe it's because my face has barely changed, but they could recognise me at one glance, and that made me feel very touched.\" Meeting the stars whom she worked with two decades ago immediately took Xianmin back to the past, especially when exchanging numbers with Xiang Yun. \"I don't know why but I subconsciously gave [her] my mum's number when I should have given her mine!\" she laughed, adding that it was how her people used to contact her when she was still a child actress. Though it has been 20 years, Xianmin still remembers her days on set like they were yesterday. For example, how Xiang Yun and Edmund took really good care of her and that she called the former \"mummy\" on and off set. \"I'll always remember that one time I had to deliver some really difficult lines, which included words like 'digestive system' as well as 'large and small intestines'. I had so many no-good takes and it caused the seven-to-eight people on set to have to redo their parts over and over again,\" she said. \"I was so stressed out that I cried. Edmund came to console me. Everyone was very nice, they even helped to touch up my make-up.\" Xianmin also recalled how Jin Yinji, who played her grandma in Double Happiness, would always bring good food on set. \"In the show, we sold fish and chips. In real life Jin-jie would deep-fry food on the spot to share with everyone,\" she reminisced. Till today, Xianmin, who also starred in Springs Of Life (2002) and A Child's Hope (2003), still gets recognised in public, with many people telling her that they \"grew up watching [her] shows\". Even an ex-colleague from China, who watched Double Happiness on CCTV-8 back then, could recognise her. Looking back at her acting days, Xianmin said she really cherishes that period. \"My childhood was really innocent. I just truly enjoyed acting and was part of a very long drama. All my seniors [such as Ivy Lee, Xie Shaoguang and Aileen Tan] were extremely well-known and they were so nice to me,\" she said, adding that she's thankful her mum agreed to let her act. Xianmin, who won the Young Talent Award at the 2004 Star Awards for her performance in Double Happiness, still has her trophy displayed in her living room.

A post shared by Iman Fandi Ahmad (@imanfandi17) In a post on her Instagram page, Iman shared about the experience, calling it something she had always dreamt of as a young child. \"Never in a million years did I think I’d be on (a billboard) in NYC with Spotify! I remember getting the call to have this opportunity and I really couldn’t believe it until we had to shoot it literally the next day! Having the support of Spotify and Equal has not only inspired me as a female artiste but many others to keep creating music and make a mark in the industry.\" Iman, who is the only daughter of Singapore football legend Fandi Ahmad and former model Wendy Jacobs, made her singing debut in 2021 with her single Timeframe and has since put out multiple songs including Top Bop, Love Me Little More and Leave You On Read.

Here's your chance with the 12th edition of Star Search. Mediacorp's Star Search returns after a five-year hiatus. (Photo: Mediacorp) This audio is generated by an AI tool. After a five-year hiatus, Mediacorp's talent discovery programme Star Search returns this year. The search begins with three rounds of open auditions to be held on Jul 6 and 7 at Funan, and Jul 13 at Orchard Central. Since its inception in 1988, Star Search has been instrumental in uncovering and nurturing some of Singapore’s most beloved celebrities, including Zoe Tay, Chen Hanwei, Chew Chor Meng, Christopher Lee, Qi Yuwu, Felicia Chin, Desmond Tan and more. The last winner, back in 2019, was Zhang Zetong, who eventually went on to win Best Supporting Actor at this year's Star Awards . In proving that they have what it takes to become the next big sensation, hopefuls aged between 17 and 30 years old must first shine at the open auditions through a series of challenges. Specifically, they will first be tested on their ability to express different emotions; followed by an opportunity to flaunt their charisma through physical strength and endurance, as well as their wits and knowledge. Application requirements and audition details can be found at mediacorp.com.sg/starsearch2024 . Among shortlisted contenders who pass the auditions, 20 budding stars will be further identified by a panel of industry veterans. They will embark on a five-month journey packed with extensive mentorship and knockout challenges, all aimed at discovering their true potential and reveal who is poised to become the next big star. At stake is a brand new BYD car for each of the top three winners, and a Mediacorp contract for the grand champion. Audiences can look forward to witnessing their journeys to stardom in a curated five-episode series, set to show every Sunday from Oct 20, culminating in a “Live” Final Battle on Nov 24.

    "article_content": "Entertainment Entertainment Singapore Entertainment Trending Women Obsessions Women Wellness Travel Wellness Wellness People People Buyers' Guide People Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Dining Dining People Dining Experiences Travel Travel Travel Entertainment Entertainment News about the imminent closure of Cathay Cineplexes at AMK Hub on Jun 30 sparked the usual comments that the cost and convenience of streaming services have killed Singaporeans' love for physical cinemas. But CNA Lifestyle's Grace Yeoh doesn't believe the reasons are that simple. A photo of Cathay Cineplexes at AMK Hub, dated November 2019. (Photo: Facebook/AMK Hub) This audio is generated by an AI tool. I love, love, love watching a movie in the cinemas for the same reasons many people probably can’t stand it. I get tsk-tsked if I check my phone, I can’t pause the movie to reply a text or rewind it if I miss the dialogue, and I can’t watch any show whenever I want. I have to carve out a good two hours at least for the whole shebang – ahead of time and at the cinema’s convenience. It’s rarely a last-minute addition to the day, mindlessly shoved into some spare time before bed. In the dark theatre, nothing matters but the story on screen. Not your boss’s email nor your pinging family group chat. (Well, that’s the hope.) You get to be transported to another world – an experience that’s the closest thing I have to magic – and I have yet to find another luxury that’s equally affordable and accessible. True luxury in life is, after all, being able to explore what matters to you. So I sympathise with any cinemagoer who frequents Cathay Cineplexes in AMK Hub and feels the loss with the cinema’s impending end of operations on Jun 30 . On CNA’s Facebook post about the news on Thursday (Jun 20), several commenters lamented the rising cost of a movie ticket compared with the more value-for-money streaming service subscription fee , as well as the ease of catching movies via such services instead. I get it – I’m more than a streaming enthusiast, I’m a fan of practicality. But amid the sea of cynicism about the future of cinemas , I found a response that may have inadvertently captured the crux of why there have been fewer cinema attendees in Singapore. One netizen wrote: “People still watch cinemas when projectors (are) as cheap as S$100 (and) can have cinema in bedroom?” And in response, another countered, “Then you eat outside for what, when there’s a kitchen and dining table at home?” The latter line debunked my previously firmly held belief that cost and convenience were the root cause of declining cinemagoers. It was never entirely about cost – many Singaporeans wouldn’t think twice paying S$15 for a meal, but spending the same amount on a single movie ticket would be daylight robbery. Neither was it really about convenience – not when many Singaporeans would gladly queue, or pay others to queue, for hours for a single chance to buy their favourite artiste’s concert tickets, or happily suffer the waiting time at the immigration checkpoints just for the quintessential eat-play-massage Johor Bahru experience. (Cannot relate. Could never be me.) Moreover, concerns of cost and convenience are not unique to Singapore, even though our pragmatism may mean we place more emphasis on these factors as the reasons we do anything at all. Rather, we simply don’t value the cinema-going experience. And the value of something, as anyone who has purchased literally anything will tell you, is not the same as its cost. COVID KILLED THE CINEMA? To be fair, cinema attendance wasn’t always so abysmal. There were a record 22.1 million cinema attendees in 2011, according to data by the Singapore Film Commission that dates back to 1998. Even though that figure fell back to around 19 million towards the end of that decade, Singapore continued to have one of the world’s highest per capita attendance rates. Then the pandemic hit, plunging attendees to a total of 4.7 million in 2020 due to the closure of cinemas and tightened restrictions. And while cinema attendance has since recovered to 10 million in 2023, it's still a far cry from the heyday of Singapore’s cinemas. Streaming services like Netflix, already changing consumption habits in the late 2010s, also exacerbated cinema’s downfall. The variety of shows available, the ease of pausing and restarting a movie at our own pace, and the subscription fee per month – sometimes less than the price of a movie ticket – provided plenty of reasons not to return to physical cinemas. AMK Hub’s Cathay Cineplexes isn’t the only casualty. Cathay Cineplex at Cineleisure Orchard closed in June last year, while its Parkway Parade outlet ceased operations months later in August. Filmgarde Cineplexes shut two of its three cinemas in 2022. And WE Cinemas – which was rebranded from Eng Wah Cinemas in 2010 and was once the fourth biggest cinema operator here after Golden Village, Cathay and Shaw – has just one cinema left in Clementi. And yet, I see these external factors – valid as they may be – as mere catalysts in the decline of cinema attendance and appreciation. In my view, the real cause is that we tend to consume movies like fast food: We’re just looking for a quick and filling experience, not necessarily one that’s satisfying. PRIORITIES AND PREFERENCES For many so-called practical Singaporeans, going to the cinemas is an unnecessary indulgence. It’s the fat we trim when we have to tighten our purse strings, one of the first few items to be culled from our monthly expenditure in our quest for FIRE . As long as we still get to watch the movie in the end, who cares where and how we watch it? Personally, I choose to cut out ridiculous S$30 (or even S$20) brunch outings and refuse to fork out a kidney for my gym membership, if only so I can escape to a movie showing whenever I feel like it. I usually emerge from a cinema hall so mentally stimulated, excited to spend the next 10 hours watching YouTube essays about the movie’s set design or reading 5,000-word film critiques about a particular scene – even if the movie didn’t quite live up to the hype. I still go down these rabbit holes if I watch the movie at home, which I do very often. But admittedly, my decision depends on the movie – I tend to save the action flicks and psychological thrillers for the laptop, and prefer to see the emotional tear-jerkers on the big screen. When I caught Oscar-nominated Past Lives on my internet browser after missing it in theatres, I could only sense muted emotions, even though I enjoyed the storyline. Instead of being immersed in the protagonist’s inner war, torn between devotion to the life she’s built and a longing for part of her history, I simply made out a half-hearted, fleeting semblance of melancholy. Truly, some films demand to be seen and felt in the cinema. Even if I had a world class surround sound system at home, I wouldn't be able to replicate the cinema experience. Going to the cinema is also, ultimately, about having a third place – a place to relax and hang out beyond the workplace or the private, domestic space of one's home. Understandably, the things I prioritise might be what others forgo, and vice versa. But Singapore’s highly efficient and pragmatic culture seeps into every aspect, as do our pretty homogeneous lifestyle preferences and priorities – just look at our cookie-cutter malls . So we might, in fact, eventually have one or two cinema halls left in Singapore. In the meantime, the simple joy of going to the cinema is still there for the taking. It would be regrettable if we denied ourselves life's little luxuries that we can afford, but it would be a greater shame if the loss is one we later realise we can’t afford.

Azure skies and beautiful beaches of Koh Samui (Photo: CNA/May Seah) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Business class is great and all, but have you had the thrill of being the first bum to occupy a brand new seat on a brand new airplane? Those of us boarding Scoot’s fresh-off-the-production-line Embraer E190-E2s for six of the airline’s routes got to inhale that “new seat” smell and revel smugly in the knowledge that, in entirely scientific terms, the presence of other people’s leftover molecules was negligible. As my posterior made contact with the cool smoothness of the seat’s pristine pleather, the singularity of that moment washed over me: How many people can say they have boldly gone where no bum has gone before? I was on board Scoot’s inaugural flight to Koh Samui, one of the airline’s latest new destinations made possible by the acquisition of the Embraer E190-E2s – Singapore’s first planes from the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer. This particular plane had been christened Small Yella Fella (in lettering on the side of the plane) and, designed for short to medium routes, it is little with a huge advantage: Its 112 seats are in a two-by-two configuration, eliminating the dreaded middle seat. A smooth two hours later, we touched down in Koh Samui, Thailand, to a welcoming fanfare of a water canon parade, officials holding a banner, and flower garlands placed around the necks of every single passenger. This, combined with the powerful effect of Koh Samui’s al fresco airport designed to look like an 80s tropical resort complete with thatched roofs, bean bags and golf buggies, succeeded in immediately putting me in a holiday mood, in a destination widely known as a Thai island paradise. But I was, of course, here for work, and there was a full, structured itinerary of things the local tourism folks had appointed for me to see, do and write about, all requiring strict journalistic professionalism. Such as the very first attraction they took me to: A rock shaped like a particular part of the male anatomy. This natural, coastal rock formation is known as “Hin Ta” or “grandfather” in Thai, and is a cylindrical column rising skywards that looks, from all angles, like a body part you would not want to think about in conjunction with your own grandfather. But, as a metaphor for nature and how we are all children of the earth, it is quite poetic, especially because next to it is another rock formation known as “Hin Yai” or “grandmother”, which is quite hard to locate unless you know exactly where it is. Other cultural monuments on the island have to do with Buddhism, like the picturesque 12m-tall Buddha at Wat Phra Yai, known as the Big Buddha Temple; or they have to do with the first Chinese settlers who arrived in the mid-1800s, like a 16m tall statue of general Guan Yu in a dedicated shrine. However, judging by the comparatively large number of tourists at the Hin Ta Hin Yai rocks, it is quite clear which attraction wins the popularity contest. A post shared by CNA (@channelnewsasia) THE ISLANDER LIFE But it is stunning beaches and beautiful blue-green waters that Koh Samui is known for, and there are beach resorts a-plenty to choose from, like The Sarann where I spent my first night, which offers rustic villas and chill vibes. Or, if you saved some money by flying here on a budget carrier, you could possibly justify splashing out on a swanky villa with a private pool at W Koh Samui, where I spent my next two nights; or a swish ocean-view room or villa at the newly opened, adults-only Explorar resort. To immerse in sun, sea and sand, we headed to Ang Thong Marine National Park, a collection of around 40 small islands reached by speedboat, about 20km from Koh Samui. On the main island, known as Ko Wua Ta Lab, you can hike the rocky Pha Jun Jaras Nature Trail for breathtaking views, but this is not for the physically unfit (I only made it to the 200m viewpoint before my thighs started crying at the thought of climbing back down; for context, the top of the mountain is 500m up). The views of the emerald ocean from a vantage point are truly stunning though, and we even spotted beautiful wild dusky spectacled langurs in the trees. These primates aren’t scarily aggressive like the denizens of MacRitchie – local guides ensure tourists don’t feed them, so they don’t approach humans. On Mae Ko island is a much easier (although still strenuous) climb up a series of very narrow steps to a viewpoint overlooking what’s known as the Blue Lagoon or Emerald Lake. It’s worth breaking a sweat for as the water is a deeply mesmerising shade of brilliant turquoise. Jumping in for a swim, tempting as it may be, is strictly prohibited. Not only is the drop dangerously steep, “We don’t know what might be living in the water,” our guide intoned. At Na Thap island, we pushed off from the shore in kayaks to explore the pretty coastline, gliding in and out of natural cave formations. And on our way back to Koh Samui, our boat stopped for a spot of snorkelling amid corals and fish. COCONUT EVERYTHING Before the tourism boom in Koh Samui, the island’s economy was built on coconuts. The family-run Coconut Museum is a small testament to its history of growing, harvesting and trading coconuts. In addition to a small museum display, the facility still farms and processes coconuts. Following traditional methods, the fruit of the tallest trees are picked by trained monkeys, owner Nuttapul Soralamb revealed; there is even a monkey training school. He also told me that in the past, life was so coconut-intensive that the fruits were also instrumental in matchmaking. If you were a young man looking to settle down, it would be pretty hard to meet girls, as they were kept at home away from prying eyes such as your own. So, you would stand outside the kitchen area of an eligible bachelorette’s house and listen to the sounds of her de-husking and grinding coconuts. From this, you would learn whether she was a fast and efficient worker and would make a good wife, or was slacking off, dilly-dallying and doing her chores halfheartedly. Soralamb did not say how you would be able to tell who was in fact doing the coconut grinding, but his parents and grandparents were all in the coconut business, so he’s living proof that it all worked out. These days, he also makes products like extra virgin coconut oil for sale, and hosts coconut cooking classes. He and his family gave a demonstration on the making of kalamae, a traditional coconut caramel candy that Koh Samui is known for. Made from coconut milk, coconut sugar and glutinous rice flour, the chewy, sticky, pyramid-shaped sweet bears a family resemblance to the kalamay in the Philippines and the dodol in many Southeast Asian countries. Traditionally wrapped in banana leaf and shaped into a triangle, the sweet treat was enjoyed at new year and wedding celebrations. Today, you typically find it wrapped in plastic for sale – and as a dutiful tourist, I had to buy some – but it’s still a tasty snack. For a full meal, there’s no shortage of adorably charming beachfront restaurants, like family-run Hug Samui, where you dine against the backdrop of a stunning sunset, lapping waves and, if you’re lucky, a fire show on the beach after dark. Koh Samui has 11 restaurants that have been listed in the Michelin Guide, like the beachside Baan Suan Lung Khai, which serves the freshest catch of the day from local fishermen; and Kapi Sator, where I discovered an eye-popping dish specific to the island: A species of local octopus, handpicked from sandy beaches, cooked in coconut milk. This dish stood out by a mile because it looks like, well, pink bubblegum soup. Its purplish-rose colour comes from the cooked octopus, and the sweet milkiness of the dish is balanced out by the addition of shrimp paste, fragrant lemongrass, chilli and, at this restaurant, pearl onions. It was with some trepidation, thanks to the unnatural pastel hue, that I lifted the first spoonful to my lips. But, it turned out to be very tasty and undoubtedly the most memorable dish of the trip. I left Koh Samui with a distended belly, a glowing tan and a deep, newfound respect for coconuts. Copyright© Mediacorp 2024. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

URA had said a member of the public had complained about the mural, but following public outcry, is re-evaluating its stance. Mural by artist Sean Dunston in Chinatown, Singapore, featuring the image of a smoking samsui woman. (Photo: CNA/Raydza Rahman) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Women's rights group AWARE and famed mural artist Yip Yew Chong have weighed in on the debate surrounding a Chinatown mural featuring a smoking samsui woman. This comes after the mural's artist Sean Dunston took to Instagram to reveal that the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had asked him to erase the cigarette from the artwork. He added that the agency said it had received feedback from a member of public who claimed that the mural was \"offensive and disrespectful\" to samsui women. According to the member of public, \"the woman depicted in this mural looks more like a prostitute than a hardworking samsui woman.” After Dunston's post went viral, URA announced on Jun 22 that it was \"re-evaluating its position\" due to public feedback . In an Instagram post on Jun 23, artist Yip Yew Chong said he believed that Dunston's work was not offensive, neither was it promoting smoking. In his post, Yip wrote: \"In reality, samsui women indeed smoked a lot and had many personalities, being human. It is not impossible for a young, freshly migrated samsui woman to smoke and sit like that. We cannot be too stereotypical and expect certain occupations must have only a specific look and no others.\" \"Art's intention is a much wider than to document actual history or beautify a place. It is primarily intended to draw emotions, thoughts and conversations.\" Yip shared his own experience with authorities, saying he believes the government agencies dealing with urban art are \"all made up of well-meaning individuals who are just doing their jobs to maintain societal order and urban control.\" He added: \"As an artist, I do wish governmental censorship is more relaxed in Singapore, and I can exercise less self-censorship too ... As society demographics, attitudes and global information accessibility change, the authorities will have to review their censorship and enforcement stance to catch up. \"As Singapore is also aiming for a thriving arts scene, it will be a delicate balance. Regardless, approvals and censorship should be based on principles and not be perceived to be based on public complaints as thought to be in many past cases.\" A post shared by Yip Yew Chong (@yipyewchong) In a social media post on Jun 24, AWARE stated that it welcomed the discourse surrounding the saga and appreciated that URA was considering public feedback. On the artwork, the organisation said the depiction of the samsui woman diverged \"significantly from the historical reality of these resilient labourers\". \"In the mural, she is shown holding a cigarette in a glamorous way that does not reflect the gritty and harsh realities faced by the samsui women. This artistic choice may inadvertently perpetuate a male gaze that exoticises female subjects, which could detract from a true appreciation of their contributions. \"While we champion artistic freedom, we also believe it is crucial for artistic interpretations to engage thoughtfully with their subjects and contexts. We encourage a portrayal that more accurately reflects the robust and rugged spirit of the samsui women, ensuring their story is told with the respect and authenticity it deserves.\" AWARE also expressed its concerns that \"URA justified its decision by citing public feedback that the woman looked like a prostitute\". \"This statement supports damaging, patriarchal stereotypes about how women should act and look, and is disrespectful to sex workers.\" In an earlier statement to media, URA said the original decision was due to the fact that the mural had been painted without approval and was not in line with the government’s anti-smoking policy stance. The remark from the member of the public about the woman looking like a prostitute was cited in Dunston's initial Instagram post as feedback to the building owner. Speaking to CNA earlier, Dunston said that he was thankful that URA was taking another look at its decision, and he hopes that the authority will allow the mural to remain as it is now. \"It’s important that the public feedback (URA uses) to regulate images seen in public be more even-handed (or at least less offensive than the art it’s criticising) and that enforcement of policy regarding art, in particular, be more nuanced and geared towards supporting art and discussion,\" he said.

Dancers performed Goh Choo San's piece “Momentum” at the Kennedy Center in US capital Washington DC. This audio is generated by an AI tool. Late Singaporean ballet choreographer Goh Choo San was honoured at a dazzling recital in the United States on Friday (Jun 21). During the one-night-only tribute with a special focus on Goh, dancers performed his piece “Momentum” at the Kennedy Center in US capital Washington DC – the first on a major US stage. The tribute was among a series that was part of a week-long festival called 10,000 Dreams: A Celebration of Asian Choreography, an event founded by arts advocate Phil Chan. Goh grew up in Singapore, but took his talents across the world in the 1970s. In the US, he served as resident choreographer for the Washington Ballet for nearly a decade. He is credited with being the first Asian choreographer to gain international recognition. He contributed works to the American Ballet Theatre, Paris Opera, Royal Danish Ballet, Houston Ballet, and Boston Ballet, among many other companies around the world. Goh received the Cultural Medallion, Singapore’s highest arts accolade, in 1986. The award honours local arts practitioners whose artistic excellence, contribution and commitment have enriched and distinguished Singapore’s arts and culture scene, according to the National Arts Council. A year later in 1987, he died from viral colitis at the young age of 39. Chan believes Goh “should be recognised as a great American choreographer and a trailblazer for our community”, according to the festival website. INSPIRATION FOR DANCERS Principal dancer of Singapore Ballet Kwok Min Yi said Goh is an inspiration for many dancers, even today. “His style, his ballets, that's the backbone of our company. Every dancer who has walked through (our) doors will have learned his ballets,” she told CNA. “I've been watching his ballets since I was young … So it's very important for me because he was the trailblazer for us.” Artistic Director of Singapore Ballet Janek Schergen said Goh was his best friend, and that he would have been delighted to see what his legacy has helped create. \"I'm very pleased that (the tribute) is happening because he was the person who broke the race barrier. Nobody can change that. He was the first Asian choreographer in classical ballet,” he said. The establishment of Singapore Ballet was inspired by Goh’s career, and his ballets are a treasure, Schergen said previously. ASIAN REPRESENTATION The festival aims to provide a platform for Asians and Asian-Americans who represent cultures from countries like Singapore, Japan and the Philippines. “I thought it was really beautiful to see a variety of different ethnicities on stage, and to hear from Asians themselves, Asian choreographers themselves, how exciting it is to them to feel represented. I thought it was great,” said one audience member. Such representation is the goal for Chan, who has been trying to improve Asian representation in US ballet. Asians make up around 7 per cent of the country’s population. “There's a limitless amount of creativity among Asian-American choreographers,” he told CNA. “My longer-term dream is that we're not just seen as the token Asian who is brought in among a larger group to show that we are diverse. But instead, we're seen as artists that belong there because of our talent and not because we have to check some box.” Copyright© Mediacorp 2024. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

(Photo: iStock/Sitthiphong) This audio is generated by an AI tool. With our love for food and penchant for food hunting (sometimes on dubious grounds), ingesting the odd tummy-upsetting pathogen is almost par for the course – along with a bout or two of abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea or changes in bowel habits. But what if that stomach pain means more than just a case of food poisoning because, as it turns out, there are many other bowel conditions that can also elicit similar reactions? For example, irritable bowel syndrome or IBS is always characterised by abdominal pain after eating, though it may also be accompanied with diarrhoea, constipation or a change in stool consistency, said Dr Eric Wee, a senior consultant gastroenterologist with Nobel Gastroenterology Centre at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. Another gastrointestinal issue, inflammatory bowel disease or IBD, may also share similar symptoms. “Many patients consult gastroenterologists thinking they might have an IBD or IBS, and are eventually diagnosed to have the other condition, or some other illness such as a gastroenteritis (infection) instead,” said Dr Wee . “Much of the confusion stems from the fact that both conditions may present with abdominal pain, diarrhoea or a change in the bowel habit. The more serious condition is IBD and fortunately, it occurs infrequently.” HOW DO WE TELL IF IT’S JUST FOOD POISONING OR SOMETHING ELSE? It can be difficult to tell because d iarrhoea, stomach pain and bloating are signs of many digestive diseases, including IBS, IBD, c eliac disease, gluten intolerance and lactose intolerance , according to Dr Wee , who said the most common cause is usually food poisoning or gastroenteritis. IBS is caused by “overly sensitive nerves in the bowels” that cause the “muscles to contract too much after eating and abdominal cramps to occur”, noted HealthXchange . But the reasons for the excessive muscle contractions are often not completely understood, according to Singhealth , although they can include “diet intolerance, stress, depression, abnormality in intestinal bacteria content or abnormal intestinal tract movement”. There is ground to suspect IBS if your abdominal pain or discomfort persists for at least three days per month in the last three months – and is accompanied by at least two of the following: IBD is another tough one to know for sure. “T here are no unique symptoms for IBD”, said Dr Wee . “However, patients often have mucous and blood in their stools. Their symptoms tend to have a longer and more chronic history as compared to gastroenteritis, which hits an individual relatively hard and fast. In severe cases of IBD, there may be fatigue, anaemia, fever and weight loss.” SO, IS THAT IBS OR IBD? One way to know what you have is through medical tests such as scans, stool tests, colonoscopies and biopsies. For IBS, “biopsies of the bowel generally do not show any abnormality”, said Dr Sulaiman Bin Yusof, a colorectal and general surgeon with Colorectal Clinic Associates. In contrast, IBD biopsies often show up distinct abnormalities, he said. IBD is an autoimmune disease caused by the inflammation of the digestive tract, explained Dr Wee . “Immune cells from the body inadvertently cause damage to the digestive tract.” Depending on which part of the gastrointestinal tract is affected, IBD is categorised as Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis. In Crohn’s disease, the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small bowel, colon and anus can be affected. The damaged areas may appear in patches that are next to areas of healthy tissue, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . “Crohn’s disease may affect one location in the digestive tract or multiple places simultaneously,” said Dr Wee . “In severe cases, the inflammation may extend through the bowel wall and into other organs or the skin.” Meanwhile, u lcerative colitis mainly affects the large intestine or colon, said Dr Sulaiman. “In some cases, u lcerative colitis can also affect the last part of the small intestine before it joins the colon. Typically, u lcerative colitis affects the left side of the colon and rectum. Its hallmark feature is continuous areas of shallow ulceration of the colon.” Both of these conditions may also manifest with joint pain in the knee or elbow, added Dr Wee . HOW COMMON ARE IBS AND IBD IN SINGAPORE? Nearly one in 10 Singaporeans suffers from IBS, according to HealthXchange . When it comes to IBD, the number is lower. “ Currently, it is estimated that there are 1,500 individuals, who may be suffering from IBD in Singapore, of which 200 are children,” said Dr Sulaiman. While low, IBD cases appear to be on the rise. “ Singapore General Hospital saw close to 600 patients diagnosed with the disease in the year 2017, a two-fold increase from a decade ago in 2007,” said Dr Sulaiman, citing press reports. “National University Hospital saw a striking eight-fold increase in IBD patients, from below 50 in 2013 to close to 400 cases in 2018. The rise in numbers can be attributed to better awareness and better diagnostic capabilities in recent years.” Of the two IBD conditions, “ulcerative colitis is more common than Crohn’s disease and fortunately, ulcerative colitis is easier to treat”, said Dr Wee . “Crohn’s disease has more complications and is more resistant to treatment.” WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE REPERCUSSIONS OF IBS AND IBD? When it comes to IBD, one word: Cancer – or more specifically, colorectal cancer. In Crohn’s disease that only affects the small intestine, it may also cause cancer in that part of your gastrointestinal system, said Dr Sulaiman. “The c onstant inflammation results in a high cell turnover, which predisposes to mutations resulting in cancer,” explained Dr Wee . “ Other factors include increased oxidative stress from the inflammation that leads to changes in the genes driving mutation.” Even the changes the gut microbiota undergo, owing to the medicines used to treat the autoimmune disease, may increase cancer risk, he said. Unlike IBD, IBS does not cause inflammation, a key factor in colorectal cancer risk. The two are not interchangeable. \"Diarrhoea\" refers to the texture and consistency of the stools, which are often \"watery\", \"lack form\" and are \"mushy or purely liquid\", explained Dr Eric Wee, a senior consultant gastroenterologist with Nobel Gastroenterology Centre at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. \"Frequent bowel movements\" refers to an excessive number of bowel movements a day, said Dr Wee. There isn't a “normal” number of daily bowel movements as it varies from person to person. But it generally refers to defecating more often than you usually do. \"Frequent bowel movements need not always mean passing soft, watery stools. It can also include normal or even hard stools,\" said Dr Wee. WHAT ARE THE TREATMENTS AVAILABLE? There may be a myriad of IBS treatments out there but research that backs their effectiveness remains to be seen. Here are some, according to studies : When it comes to IBD such as Crohn’s disease and u lcerative colitis, patients are usually treated with medicines that control the immune system, said Dr Wee, citing tablets and monthly injections. “There are many modern treatment options available and they include classes of drugs such as steroids, aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, biologic therapies, small molecule drugs and JAK inhibitors .\" Medicines aside, manipulating your diet may also help IBD, said Dr Wee, citing d ata from clinical trials. That means avoiding triggering foods such as processed food, preservatives, artificial sweeteners and emulsifiers as well as minimising gluten, dairy and alcohol. “Complete avoidance is not mandatory but one needs to exercise restraint. Limiting the intake of red meat is believed to be important, too,” said Dr Wee. Unfortunately, changing your diet alone is often not adequate. “Almost all individuals with IBD will require medical treatment concurrently.” Surgery to remove the affected gastrointestinal parts is only used when medical therapy fails, said Dr Sulaiman. For instance, s urgery may be used to manage the complications from Crohn’s disease to preserve as much of the bowel as possible. Copyright© Mediacorp 2024. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

She told the crowd: \"What you just did is an unforgettable moment in not just my life, but every very single one of our crew.

In the year ahead, cultural explorations and culinary experiences will drive travel decisions, particularly for GenerAsian travellers. Photos, video: Hilton This audio is generated by an AI tool. Inspired by the global prominence of Asian food, design and culture, a new generation of travellers from Asia is taking pride in exploring destinations within the region. These “GenerAsian” travellers are seeking journeys of self-discovery by acquainting themselves more intimately with their cultural roots. Immersing in the art of Japanese winemaking with a visit to a private vineyard overlooking Mount Fuji or navigating the lush Goan mangroves in India with an expert birdwatcher are just some of the culturally immersive experiences on their itineraries. According to Hilton’s 2024 Trends Report , 77 per cent of travellers in Asia Pacific are looking to deepen their understanding of their own heritage through travel, while 75 per cent are eager to learn about other Asian cultures. The survey also found that more than four in five respondents now take pride in their home country’s growing popularity as a travel destination, and feel honoured by the international appreciation of Asian food, design and culture. “At Hilton, we’ve noticed a rising interest in self-discovery and the desire for an even deeper understanding of one’s heritage, and this will be an even more important consideration for travellers in 2024,” said Mr Ben George, senior vice-president and commercial director of Hilton, Asia Pacific. ON A QUEST FOR CULTURAL CONNECTION GenerAsian travellers exhibit a profound interest in immersing themselves in local cultures. Based on the report, 84 per cent of respondents want to delve into the historical and cultural fabric of the places they visit, while almost four in five (78 per cent) aspire to build genuine connections with local communities. As such, they are more likely to book accommodations based on access to unique local experiences. A substantial majority of travellers from China (81 per cent), India (77 per cent) and Singapore (70 per cent) prioritise booking hotels that offer such access, compared to the global average of 65 per cent. ROKU KYOTO, LXR Hotels & Resorts , for instance, enables guests to experience the traditional art of washi paper-making and kintsugi – reviving broken pottery pieces with gold and lacquer – in workshops guided by local masters in Kyoto, Japan. In Bali, Indonesia, GenerAsian travellers might seek out one of Conrad Bali’s Signature Sensory Odyssey experiences, such as sound healing sessions, fragrance design workshops and Balinese cultural activities. Other one-of-a-kind experiences include stargazing with a resident astronomer and Layang Layang kite-making with a master kite builder at the newly opened Umana Bali, LXR Hotels & Resorts . And in Goa, India, travellers can interact with local communities through various walking trails, village excursions, culinary journeys and nature explorations – such as a birding trip through the mangroves followed by a hearty meal in the home of a local family. Offered by Hilton Goa Resort , these experiences provide a rare look into the Goan way of life. “We believe that the heart of a great trip is a great stay, and so we continue to invest in delivering authentic experiences to ensure our guests can fully immerse themselves in both our hotels and their communities,” said Mr George. A FEAST FOR THE SENSES A deep appreciation for food stands as a unifying passion for GenerAsian travellers. While travellers from other regions lean towards relaxation or adventure, an overwhelming 88 per cent of respondents from Asia Pacific rank discovering local and traditional culinary delights as the most important. These epicurean explorers revel in novel experiences. For instance, at Conrad Shenzhen , guests can indulge in Chaoshan cuisine at CH’AO Chinese Restaurant , where time-honoured flavours from the Chinese cities of Shantou, Chaozhou and Jieyang are reimagined around locally sourced seasonal ingredients. At Hilton’s various properties, gourmands will find themselves spoiled for choice, with dining experiences curated to align with their expectations. Ms Alexandra Jaritz, senior vice-president of brand management at Hilton, Asia Pacific, commented: “We’re constantly monitoring the travel preferences of different generations to create tailored experiences that cater to their unique needs and desires. Fuelled by a sense of pride that Asian food, design and culture are gaining popularity globally, we know this will hold even greater significance and interest for travellers in the upcoming year.” This commitment is evident across its DoubleTree by Hilton properties in Asia Pacific, where regional specialities like dosa in India, nasi lemak in Malaysia and doenjang jjigae in South Korea are included on the menu, allowing guests to discover well-loved local dishes and savour familiar comfort food. Elevated renditions of classic Sri Lankan dishes are a highlight at Hilton Yala Resort , courtesy of restaurants Dhira and Sandali. A prime example is their take on traditional egg hoppers, transformed into luxurious eggs benedict featuring bacon seeni sambol (caramelised onion jam) and curry leaf hollandaise. Further enhancing the culinary experience, Lantaaruma offers fully customised dinner menus. Here, chefs craft bespoke dining experience under the stars, continuing the theme of novel culinary creativity. Hilton Honors members can further leverage the hotel group’s expansive network across Asia Pacific when planning their culinary adventures. With the Like A Member dining offer, they can enjoy exclusive discounts and earn bonus points when dining at over 900 outlets across Hilton hotels in the region. With 71 per cent of respondents from Asia Pacific planning to prioritise travel in the upcoming year, the emphasis is on understanding travellers’ expectations and creating unforgettable experiences. Said Ms Jaritz: “From our ongoing brand innovation and dining experiences to our world-renowned hospitality, Hilton will enable guests to connect and immerse themselves in the destinations they choose to travel to.” Discover further insights on the GenerAsian traveller and other travel trends for the year ahead with the Hilton 2024 Trends Report .

Selena Gomez arrives at the MTV Video Music Awards on Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2023, at the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) Selena Gomez feels frustrated by social media. The 31-year-old star has a huge online following, but Gomez often takes breaks from social media platforms to escape the negativity. The brunette beauty – who has more than 400 million followers on Instagram – said at the TIME100 Summit: \"I find it frustrating. Then I get a little mouthy and I want to defend the people I love.\" Gomez believes it's important to take breaks from social media to retain a sense of perspective. The actress – who is currently dating record producer Benny Blanco – explained: \"I took four years off of Instagram, and I let my team post for me for those years. I felt like it was the most rewarding gift I gave myself.\" Meanwhile, Gomez previously claimed that there's \"so much strength in being vulnerable\". The Only Murders In The Building star has spoken openly about her mental health struggles over recent years, and Gomez admitted that she's found it to be a \"very freeing\" experience. She told Wondermind: \"I don’t love giving advice because I don’t have all of the answers. \"I’d say, though, find a friend or a family member you feel comfortable talking with and open up about what you are feeling. It’s very freeing to open up to someone. There is so much strength in being vulnerable.\" Despite this, Gomez doesn't have any regrets over how she's dealt with her own struggles. The actress – who first found fame as a child – explained: \"I try and not look back and wish anything could have been different. What I am happy about is that more people are opening up about their mental health.\" Copyright© Mediacorp 2024. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

(Photo: Mandai Wildlife Group) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Rest assured panda fans, ‘Very Important Panda’ Le Le, as dubbed by Singapore Airlines (SIA) , arrived safely in Chengdu, China, on Tuesday (Jan 16) night. He left Singapore at 7.17pm that night in an SIA Boeing 747-400F freighter aircraft and, according to aviation site Flightradar24, landed at the Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport at 11.14pm. The Singapore-born cub, who turns three years old in August, is now serving his second round of quarantine, a mandatory measure, said the Mandai Wildlife Group and SIA in a joint press release on Jan 17. His quarantine in China is expected to last for 30 days, according to Xinhua news agency. He will now will be closely monitored by the China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Panda (CCRCGP) to determine his next home. Le Le completed his first quarantine, which lasted four and a half weeks, at River Wonders in the Mandai Wildlife Reserve before his departure. He made his final appearance on Dec 13 at Pavilion Capital Giant Panda Forest at River Wonders then began serving his quarantine the next day. Here’s how Le Le’s emotional departure day went: 1. JOURNEY TO CHANGI AIRPORT Le Le was transported to Changi Airport via Bukit Timah, Seletar and Tampines Expressways in a customised crate, which measured approximately 1.7m long, 1.1m wide and 1.3m high. His crate was loaded onto a reefer truck, which was kept between 12°C and 16°C. During the journey, Le Le was kept comfortable with his stash of snacks – bamboo and bamboo shoots. 2. AT THE AIRPORT Once Le Le reached the airport, his crate was secured to a pallet, along with his travel essentials – food. There, his panda care team also attached a handcrafted heart-shaped card, with their well wishes for Le Le, to his crate to accompany him on his journey. The palletised crate weighed in at about 600kg. 3. BOARDING THE PLANE The runway soon became one fit for a VIP as guests lined the airport tarmac to bid farewell to Le Le as his customised travel crate was loaded through the nose of the aircraft. 4. ENROUTE TO CHINA On board the plane with Le Le were his keeper and veterinarian from Mandai Wildlife Group as well as a keeper from China, who fed and checked on Le Le throughout the four-and-a-half-hour flight. “Le Le took well to the flight and maintained a good appetite throughout, chomping on bamboo and bamboo shoots,” said Mandai Wildlife Group and SIA. “Le Le’s arrival in China marks a new chapter for him as he now officially joins China’s giant panda conservation programme for the protection of his species.” Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

Out of the 10 Coldplay tickets, eight were given to migrant workers and two to volunteers at Krsna's Free Meals. (Photos: TikTok/Krsna's Free Meals) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Recently, a few migrant workers in Singapore got the chance to catch Coldplay's Jan 27 show for free, thanks to a collaboration between global non-profit organisation Love Button and local soup kitchen Krsna's Free Meals. The collaboration is part of Coldplay's and Love Button's joint initiative to work with organisations at every stop of the rock band's Music Of The Spheres world tour to \"make a difference in the local communities\". In Singapore, Krsna's Free Meals was one of the three charity organisations selected for this endeavour. The collaboration saw staff members from both Love Button and Coldplay's team volunteering at the soup kitchen on Jan 23 and 27. Love Button also donated 10 tickets to Coldplay's Jan 27 show. Initially, out of the 10 tickets, eight went to migrant workers and two went to volunteers at Krsna's Free Meals. The eight migrant workers were chosen randomly via Willy Wonka-esque golden tickets attached to packets of nuts that were handed out at Krsna's Free Meals' kitchen. However, a few of the workers could not make it to the concert due to \"last minute work\" and as such, their tickets were given to volunteers instead. In a separate video, Krsna's Free Meals said that the purpose of the initiative was to \"inspire, help (the migrant workers) dream and to teach them that there is kindness in the world\". A video taken on the night of the concert showed the migrant workers enjoying dinner with members of Krsna's Free Meals and dancing along to Coldplay's songs while wearing T-shirts of the band. When asked about the concert, a spokesperson for Krsna's Free Meals told CNA Lifestyle: \"Everyone had a wonderful time. The concert was a magnificent show and the migrant workers who didn’t know the music at all, were rocking to the beats and enjoying the spectacle. \"It was something no one had ever seen before. The volunteers enjoyed the experience more, they said, because of the special role they had in assuring the workers got there safely. They felt the joy of the workers, and it was very satisfying to see them having a great time at the concert.\" Reactions to this collaboration have been overwhelmingly positive with many calling it \"cute\" and \"wholesome\". The initiative marks one of the many taken by Coldplay to bring about a positive impact during their world tour. These include having a kinetic dance floor and electric bikes that power the show to providing green transport options for fans heading home. Coldplay will be performing their sixth and final Singapore show on Jan 31. Copyright© Mediacorp 2024. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

A few of the angsty responses from Elmo's wellness check post. (Photos: X/Elmo) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Beloved Sesame Street character Elmo has responded to the slew of emotional replies that followed his post on social media platform X. On Monday (Jan 29), Elmo asked his followers a simple question : \"How is everybody doing?\" The innocuous query prompted over 50,000 quotes and replies with users lamenting their lives and airing their grievances to Elmo. Some of the problems faced by these users include losing their jobs, the rising cost of living expenses, their social lives and their mental health. The many seemingly-bleak responses even led to Sesame Street's official account uploading resources on emotional well-being. Days later on Jan 31, Elmo made a new post, saying he has learnt the importance of asking a friend \"how they are doing\" and promised he \"will check in again soon\". Likewise, other Sesame Street characters – including Cookie Monster and Big Bird – made similar posts, emphasising the importance of checking in with loved ones. Even US President Joe Biden got in on the action to support Elmo. In his post , Biden said: \"I know how hard it is some days to sweep the clouds away and get to sunnier days. \"Our friend Elmo is right: We have to be there for each other, offer our help to a neighbour in need, and above all else, ask for help when we need it. Even though it's hard, you're never alone.\" Speaking to NBC News about the saga, Aaron Bisman, the vice president of audience development at Sesame Workshop said: \" Many of our social posts are designed to make audiences smile or laugh, while others promote and share resources for kids and their parents, caregivers, and loved ones who make up their circle of care. “Leveraging the interest in Elmo’s tweet to posting the quote tweet from Sesame Street with emotional wellbeing resources is exactly what Sesame Workshop was created to do.\" Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

Don't be surprised if you hear a new jingle on your next train commute. SMRT recently announced that it will progressively roll out new chimes and jingles across all its trains and over 70 stations under its purview from Wednesday (Feb 14). This comes after a three-month pilot programme that began on Oct 29. Made in collaboration with nonprofit organisation The Teng Company, the chimes and jingles take inspiration from local tunes such as The Tricycle, Chan Mali Chan and Singai Naadu . They will be played at the following stations: 1. North-South Line Marina South Pier, Marina Bay, Dhoby Ghaut, Somerset, Orchard, Newton, Novena, Toa Payoh, Braddell, Bishan, Ang Mo Kio, Yio Chu Kang, Yishun, Sembawang, Woodlands, Marsiling, Kranji, Yew Tee, Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Gombak. 2.

Social media users have uploaded videos of the new chimes in action over the months, which sound upbeat and cheery. A quick check by CNA Lifestyle found that the tunes are currently playing in stations and trains along Changi Airport and Tanah Merah. In a LinkedIn post , The Teng Company creative director Samuel Wong spoke about the thought process behind the collaboration, saying: \"We worked so hard on this because we wanted to build a more inclusive Singaporean society. We hope to give our visually impaired friends more dignity and respect. \"Teng’s research found that the visually impaired look out for the extremity of sound. Our chimes create this extremity by choosing to put a brighter sound for trains going in one direction and a mellower sound for trains going in converse direction. The jingles were created in the same key and in harmony and were designed to be able to be played simultaneously should the need arise.\" Copyright© Mediacorp 2024. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

This audio is generated by an AI tool. Indonesian influencer Una Dembler, who was filmed spitting on a fellow Bruno Mars concertgoer during a queue dispute, has apologised for her behaviour. The incident happened last Friday (Apr 5) when ticket holders for the standing pen area were waiting in line for the second of the American singer's three concerts at the National Stadium. In a video posted by Singaporean influencer Sabrina Sim last Friday, Ms Una is seen gesturing and arguing with several concertgoers seated in a queue to enter the standing pen. After presumably being told to go to the back of the queue, she praises another man out of frame, saying \"this boy is good\" because he had nicely informed her to go to the back of the line. \"But he's not throwing rice on my body... okay?... I felt that.\" She can be heard repeating \"it's your rice, it's your rice\", before spitting on one of them – later revealed to be Ms Sim – as her friend comes up to lead her away. In her TikTok caption, Ms Sim, 22, explained that her group had been queueing behind a man who was going for the concert alone when Ms Una \"just sat her buttocks down\" in front of him, prompting them to \"(stand) up for him and (call) her out\". \"She told us, 'I'm waiting for my friend',\" Ms Sim wrote. \"So we told her nicely, 'This is the front of the queue though, you can go to the back of the queue and wait for your friend'. \"But clearly, she wasn't too happy with being called out even though she was the one who shamelessly tried to cut the queue. Got spit on in the end... \"All I can say is... Those attending on April 5, please be considerate and try your best not to be selfish to others attending the concert.\" The TikTok video, which was posted last Friday, has since garnered 2.4 million views, 62,800 likes and 3,670 comments as of Apr 8 afternoon, with many expressing sympathy for Ms Sim and encouraging her to report the incident to the police. Online users quickly tracked down and identified Ms Una as the perpetrator, flooding her social media accounts with negative comments. Over the weekend on Saturday, she responded to the backlash in an Instagram Story, claiming that the video circulating was \"not 100 per cent true\". She had not intended to join or cut the queue, she added, but was waiting for a friend who had gone to the bathroom. Ms Una wrote: \"Suddenly I felt someone throw rice at my hair and body several times. Then there was a nice guy who told me that this was the line for Bruno Mars, and I immediately stood up and left the queue but the girl still tried to throw rice (at) me. \"I was mad and it is wrong to get emotional and spit at her. Sadly, I don't have the video (of her) throwing rice (at) me. \"Please hear my side, too. I know I was wrong to spit on her but I didn't mean to cut the queue. I will learn from this and I really regret this. I'm sorry... So sorryyy.\" Ms Sim reposted a screenshot of Ms Una's Instagram Story in a follow-up video , casting doubt on her claims of having rice thrown at her and of not knowing that she was in the middle of a queue. \"May I also just say that it was broad daylight in the early afternoon and there were many people there?\" Ms Sim added. \"If she claimed that people were throwing things at her multiple times, how is it that no one saw that?\" This story was originally published in TODAY.

Qatar's Hamad International Airport in Doha has been named the world's best airport in 2024 by London-based air transport rating organisation Skytrax, with Singapore Changi Airport coming in at second place. During the award ceremony at the Passenger Terminal Expo 2024 in Frankfurt, Germany, the airport also clinched the titles of world's best airport shopping and best airport in the Middle East. A post shared by Hamad International Airport (@hiaqatar) Hamad International Airport has experienced significant growth in the past decade, with the integration of lifestyle and shopping facilities including Orchard, an indoor garden with a bridge. In 2023, it enjoyed a 31 per cent increase in passenger traffic, serving over 45 million passengers over 250 destinations. Second-place winner Singapore Changi Airport – which won the world's best airport award in 2023 – also clinched the titles of best airport in Asia and world’s best airport immigration service. Crowne Plaza Changi Airport was also named world’s best airport hotel, for the ninth time. A post shared by Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) (@changiairport) Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al Meer said of the win: \"This is a remarkable achievement for Hamad International Airport, as it celebrates its 10th anniversary of operational excellence, connecting passengers seamlessly from all around the world. It is a testament to the dedication of our team and partners, who have contributed to providing passengers with the finest travel experience. Our continuous investment in our facilities and pioneering initiatives in retail and hospitality has made this achievement possible.\" The top 20 airports this year are as follows: Operating since 1999, Skytrax's World Airport Awards are voted by airport customers of over 100 nationalities. The survey evaluates customers' experience across multiple factors including check-in, transfers, shopping and security. This year's survey was conducted between August 2023 and March 2024, and over 570 airports were featured in the survey results. All entries for the survey are screened, with duplicate or ineligible entries deleted, and no membership subscription or charges are needed to participate in the survey. Nonetheless, Skytrax has received some criticism over the years with one report in 2015 from a travel industry news site suggesting that the organisation had inflated the figures of its survey participants. Skytrax also received backlash in 2019 after it updated the ratings of certain airlines, including downgrading Turkish Airlines to three stars – prompting those in the aviation community to question Skytrax's ranking methods.

By now, most of us are aware that Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong really knows his guitars. Videos of him demonstrating his skills have previously gone viral, be it his cover of Taylor Swift's Love Story or his rendition of the classic Hokkien hit I Ask Heaven. As part of International Guitar Month in April, Mr Wong recently took to his social media pages to answer questions about his passion for playing the guitar. In the process, he also revealed some of the local brands in the space that have caught his attention. A post shared by Lawrence Wong (@lawrencewongst) On Sunday (Apr 21), Mr Wong uploaded a video in which he responded to questions from his followers regarding his hobby. In the video, Mr Wong revealed that he has been playing the guitar for over 40 years and started when his father gave him the instrument as a birthday present. Initially, a friend of his father's taught the young future Prime Minister – he will take the top job on May 15 – how to play the guitar. However, over time, Mr Wong learnt \"largely\" by himself and went to the National Library every week to borrow self-help books on guitars – including the monthly American magazine Guitar Player. He added that he would even photocopy pages and lessons from the magazine to teach himself. A post shared by MORNINGSTAR (@morningstar.engineering) On the topic of his favourite guitar, Mr Wong said that, over the years, he has \"tried out different models and brands\". However, he gets excited when he sees \"homegrown Singapore companies in (the guitar) space\" – highlighting three brands in particular: Maestro, Alabs and Morningstar. A post shared by Maestro Guitars (@maestroguitars) Formed in 2004 by Hozen Yong, Maestro Guitars is known for handcrafting their own guitars and ukuleles. Its guitars have been featured in multiple international showcases such as Music China and have been used by international artistes including Thai singer-actor Mile. A post shared by ALABS Audio (@alabsaudio) Formed in 2021, Alabs calls itself \"an audio technology brand founded by a group of music geeks from Singapore\". Despite its young age, the brand has received many positive reviews from international critics for its range of pedals and microphones. Guitar Gear Finder's Aaron Matthies praised Alabs' Cetus Reverb pedal as \"an incredibly high-quality pedal that sells for a great price\". A post shared by MORNINGSTAR (@morningstar.engineering) Many guitar players would be familiar with Morningstar Engineering for their range of MIDI controllers. However, few are aware of the fact that the brand was started in Singapore by Singapore Management University (SMU) graduates James Toh and Benjamin Chia. Morningstar products have been used by many international artistes – including Bruno Mars, who is currently using the company's MC8 controller on his world tour, as well as Dragonforce guitarist Herman Li. Speaking to CNA Lifestyle, James Toh revealed that the company first knew of Mr Wong using their products sometime in November 2020. \"Our first exchange with him was on Instagram. We sent him a DM when we noticed that he started following us. Subsequently, we also corresponded with him via email to provide technical support for some questions he had, \" Toh added. On Mr Wong's video, Toh said: \"We were pleasantly surprised when we found out that he was using our product and also filled with admiration for the fact that he is such a keen and avid musician. It was very kind of him and encouraging for us to be featured on his platform.\" So how did a humble brand like Morningstar get this much international fame? \"A few factors that enabled us to establish a global presence are a strong product, robust logistics network, strategic marketing and excellent customer service. We also exhibit annually at a music equipment convention in the United States to touch base with customers, dealers and build relationships with various industry stakeholders.\" He added: \"Most recently, we were excited to have Bruno Mars in Singapore...It was quite something seeing our product in action with such a big act on stage in Singapore.\" Mr Wong's candid video appears to have resonated with multiple fans who have called on him to create more of such videos in the future, with others jokingly inviting him for a jamming session. Fingers crossed for a solo guitar performance at his upcoming swearing-in ceremony . Copyright© Mediacorp 2024. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

The parliamentary session on Wednesday (May 8) marked Mr Lee Hsien Loong's last one as Singapore's third Prime Minister. To commemorate the occasion, the PAP women MPs got him a cake featuring some of \"his favourite items\". A post shared by Rachel Ong (@rachelong_) According to MP Rachel Ong, the cake was \"to show (their) appreciation for all [PM Lee] has done\". Depicted on the cake was an assortment of some of his favourite items including: The cake also featured the message: \"Kamsiah PM\". Kamsiah means thank you in the Hokkien dialect. A few cheeky commenters noted that the cake was missing Mr Lee's \"magic cup\", a reference to the cup he sipped from when he made speeches during the COVID-19 pandemic, oftentimes before he switched to a different language. The cake was created by chefs from Shangri-La Singapore led by Area Executive Pastry Chef Herve Potus, together with pastry chef Lee Yan Jium and chef Stephanie Khor, who was also the artist who designed the items. Weighing at an impressive 10kg, the cake was covered in fondant made with a marble effect and it comprised crunchy feuilletine and two layers of chocolate sponge fudge, sandwiched with a light cocoa butter cream. The cake was brought out to the Members’ Room after parliament adjourned by the hotel's chefs led by Chef Potus. He told CNA Lifestyle that the pastry team began by finding out PM Lee's favourite items and pastimes, and did a few rounds of sketches before the design was approved. \"We did not have time but the team managed to complete the cake by May 8,\" said Chef Potus. He added: \"I take this as more of an opportunity rather than a challenge. We are grateful that our team was able to be a part of this project as PM Lee passes on the baton. \"I feel incredibly proud and very honoured to be a part of this journey as the team celebrates PM Lee’s legacy and his contribution to Singapore.\" A post shared by Lee Hsien Loong (@leehsienloong) Sharing a video of the cake on his social media pages, PM Lee expressed his gratitude for \"all MPs, NMPs, and NCMPs, past and present, for (their) contributions to robust and serious debates\" in parliament. He also received a few laughs after saying: \"Just for the avoidance of doubt, I am stepping down as PM, not as MP.\" Mr Lee will be officially stepping down as Prime Minister on May 15, after 20 years in the role.

Here are a few facts about the fashion brand that has captured the hearts of many Hollywood celebrities. In 2023, Taylor Swift was spotted carrying an Aupen bag on one of her dates with Travis Kelce. (Photos: Aupen) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Over the past few months, Singapore-based fashion brand Aupen has enjoyed a silent but steady rise in popularity. Initially deemed a \"quiet luxury brand\", Aupen has smashed into mainstream consciousness after its bags were spotted on multiple global celebrities. Fans include Olivia Rodrigo, Jennifer Lawrence, Kylie Jenner and, of course, Taylor Swift who famously carried Aupen's Nirvana bag on a date with athlete Travis Kelce. So how did this humble brand become Hollywood's hottest commodity? Here's what you need to know about Aupen. 1. WHAT IS AUPEN? Aupen is known for its range of bags which boast a unique asymmetrical design and sleek finish. A portmanteau of the words \"authentic\" and \"open\", Aupen initially used vegan leather in its products before transitioning to calfskin leather in early 2024. Besides bags, it also has a line of earrings made of sterling silver. Its popularity has been attributed to several factors, namely its low price point (Aupen's most expensive bag costs S$565) and its clean design which makes it a versatile accessory for any outfit. 2. WHO IS BEHIND AUPEN? Aupen has studios in both Brooklyn and Singapore. However, not much is known about Aupen's team which comprises anonymous designers. According to its website, Aupen's Singapore factory houses artisans who \"have dedicated years to perfecting their craft\". The brand also sources its leather from the Leather Working Group – a collective that's committed to building a sustainable future with responsible leather. 3. WHO HAS BEEN SEEN USING IT? A post shared by AUPEN (@aupenofficial) By now, Aupen has amassed a legion of celeb fans. In a montage posted on Aupen's social media pages, celebrities who have been spotted using an Aupen bag include Emma Stone, Selena Gomez and Fan Bingbing. It is believed that Kylie Jenner was the first celebrity to kickstart the trend after she was spotted with a Fearless bag in 2022, months after Aupen's launch. Aupen's popularity hit the stratosphere in October 2023 when Taylor Swift was seen clutching onto a Nirvana bag while on a date with Travis Kelce. As Cosmopolitan puts it, that was the moment Aupen became the It bag. In an email response to CNA Lifestyle, Aupen said of its Hollywood fandom: \"Team Aupen is delighted by the growing recognition and interest from world-class celebrities. Their admiration for our work is both an honour and a testament to our innovative efforts.\" When asked about any potential collaborations with these celebrities, Aupen remained coy and wrote: \"Your guess is as good as ours. You’ll have to keep your eyes peeled.\" 4. WHY IS AUPEN IN THE SPOTLIGHT AGAIN? A post shared by AUPEN (@aupenofficial) On Friday (May 10), Aupen sent the fashion world into a tizzy when it announced that it was bidding goodbye – prompting speculation by many that it has shut down. The announcement also coincided with reports that Aupen had received investment interest from several firms. Speaking to CNA Lifestyle, Aupen confirmed that there is \"interest from the H&M group and several private equity firms\". However, it declined to comment on the figures as well as whether or not its social media posts were linked to the investment interest. When asked about its future, Aupen said that it would \"not launch new collections until further notice\". \"As a brand, we are not trying to chase collection after collection; we prioritise the real luxury ethos of timelessness.\" 5. CAN WE STILL BUY AN AUPEN BAG? A post shared by AUPEN (@aupenofficial) As of writing, only Aupen's Brooklyn bags are in stock. In a social media post, Aupen said that its sales and customer service will remain operational. However, Aupen revealed to CNA Lifestyle that it will \"most likely\" restock its items sometime in June and advised customers to sign up for its newsletter for updates. Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

The portrait commissioned by Tatler Magazine (left) and Kate Middleton (right) at an event. (Photos: X/Tatlermagazine, KensingtonRoyal) This audio is generated by an AI tool. A new portrait of Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales, has been criticised online after fans noted its lack of resemblance to her. The artwork is the third royal portrait commissioned by fashion magazine Tatler – following Queen Elizabeth II in 2022 and King Charles in 2023 – and is set to be the front cover of the magazine's July 2024 issue. The portrait was first unveiled by Tatler on Wednesday (May 22) and it immediately elicited strong responses online. A post shared by Tatler (@tatlermagazine) \"What a horrible portrait\", \"My 9-year-old granddaughter could probably have made a better job\", \"I thought it was a parody\" and \"That is soulless and cold\" are just some of the comments disparaging the portrait on Tatler's social media pages. Alastair Sooke, the chief art critic of the British newspaper The Telegraph, has even called the artwork \"intolerably bad\" with \"no flicker of resemblance to its subject\". A post shared by Tatler (@tatlermagazine) The portrait was done by British-Zambian artist Hannah Uzor who previously took part in a project to highlight overlooked figures from the African diaspora who have contributed to England's history. Uzor's portrait of Sara Forbes Bonetta, a former slave who became Queen Victoria’s goddaughter, drew attention from CNN, Sky News and even King Charles. In a video uploaded on Tatler's social media pages, Uzor spoke about the process of creating Kate's portrait. Highlighting the importance of capturing \"the soul of the person\", she added that she spent lots of time studying photos and videos of Kate at various events. The royal family, Tatler and Hannah Uzor have yet to respond to the criticism surrounding the artwork. A post shared by The Royal Family (@theroyalfamily) The backlash surrounding Hannah Uzor's painting comes days after the unveiling of King Charles' first official portrait since his coronation which also drew negative comments. The vivid red portrait of King Charles shows him standing in military attire with a butterfly hovering over him. The artwork's striking colour has attracted considerable criticism, with some saying that it looks like King Charles \"is in hell\" and \"bathing in blood\". Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

If there is one thing Thai filmmakers are so darn good at, it's dramatic storytelling. Over the weekend, this writer was inundated with friends raving about the latest Thai film to hit our shores, with many proclaiming it as \"the best film I have watched this year!\". How To Make Millions Before Grandma Dies follows a teenage university dropout who quits his game-caster job to care for his grandma who is diagnosed with end-stage cancer. The lead’s intention is made clear in the film’s title. But what was most fascinating was the number of moviegoers who hopped on a TikTok trend of recording their reactions before, during and after watching the tearjerker. Needless to say, netizens who caught the film said many tissues were used during the two-hour film. One even advised: “Bring many boxes of tissue if you are going to watch this movie.” Another visibly emotional user even hilariously said he heard a number of people bawling their eyes out throughout the film. “You are not human if you don’t cry during and after watching the show,” said a red-eyed TikToker as he left the theatre. In one video, another netizen was also seen leaving the cinema teary-eyed saying, “Don’t watch if you don’t want to cry.\" In Thailand, the film grossed 250 million baht (US$6.8 million) in the first 14 days of its release. Since its release here last Thursday (May 30), local cinema operator Golden Village said the film has earned more than S$330,000 and it had the biggest opening weekend ever for a Thai film in Singapore. A post shared by Golden Village Pictures (@goldenvillagepictures) How To Make Millions Before Grandma Dies is also seen doing well regionally, and at press time is the second biggest Asian title in Indonesia of all time with two million admissions in 13 days.

    "article_content": "Entertainment Entertainment Singapore Entertainment Trending Women Obsessions Women Wellness Travel Wellness Wellness People People Buyers' Guide People Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Dining Dining People Dining Experiences Travel Travel Travel Wellness Wellness Have child pranks on TikTok crossed the line? A clinical psychologist weighs in on how they impact children’s wellbeing and relationships with parents. (Screengrab: TikTok/therealnialove, badparentingmoments) Everyone loves candid videos of children, and nowhere on social media are unadulterated directions more celebrated than on TikTok. No wonder parents are hopping on the bandwagon of child pranks. But what happens if a child responds with not joy, but distress? Two camps have emerged from recent discourse. One is concerned for their wellbeing, another believes it’s no cause for concern. “Sharenting”, a neologism for sharing sensitive content about children on the Internet, is often examined through the lens of ethics and cyber safety, but little has been said about its impact on child psychology. CNA Lifestyle spoke with Dr Lin Hong-hui, principal clinical psychologist at The Psychology Atelier and a lecturer at Nanyang Technological University, to unpack just that. SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE PARENT-CHILD BOND Let’s start with something less contentious. A child blows the seeds off of a dandelion and starts laughing hysterically. It’s the most endearing thing their parents have seen all week, so they whip out their phones and ask them to reenact the moment for social media. What could go wrong? “When a child does something pure and innocent, they are intuitively expressing their needs for curiosity and exploration. It is lovely for parents to enjoy their cuteness and, in today's norms, express their pride through recording and sharing the moment,” Lin said. She added that things aren’t black and white, and the extent to which they rely on social media for parent-child interactions matters. “This is more concerning when a parent’s interest and positive feelings are primarily shown through these ways. Unknowingly, they could send a message to their child that: In order to receive attention and affection, I need to ‘perform’.” This message, when internalised, can communicate the opposite of unconditional love. “Self-worth is built on love and acceptance of a child as a person – period. A child is good enough, not only when they behave well or show positive moods. If a parent’s positive feelings are tied to these conditions, children may feel that simply being themselves isn’t worthy enough.\" THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF PRANKS You may have heard of TikTok’s controversial ghost filter prank. Children are locked in a room with the app, and a “ghost” appears on the front camera. Some were tickled, but others were seen screaming and struggling to escape. Like them, much of the Internet was not amused. The platform, along with parents who participated, soon came under fire. Polarising views aside, it is perhaps more useful to ask: What can all parents, even those who film their children’s meltdowns without posting them on social media, take away from this incident? Paying attention to how a child is experiencing being photographed or filmed is a good start. “If they’re distressed, they need emotional support. When parents take a video instead, they become bystanders to their child's distress, which negatively impacts a child's trust in them. If a child is clearly unhappy, self-conscious, or embarrassed, they need their parents to stop recording and attune to them.” Attunement, according to Lin, is a parent’s ability to read their child’s emotional state and meet their needs. It builds connection and cultivates a sense of self for the child. When parents, who’re supposed to be safe figures, become the very source of fright, two critical aspects come into question. A child’s sense of self-worth, and their ability to trust. “These are two fundamentals of the psychological development of a secure self. When parents frequently miss, ignore, or misread their child's needs, it raises doubts in their minds. I don't feel good, but how come Mummy and Daddy can't help me? Can I trust my closest people to take care of me? They don't get me – is it because something's wrong with me?” When a parent’s attunement is highly unpredictable, a child’s sense of security is shaky. Later in life, this informs their approach to relationships and challenges. DISTRESS ON DISPLAY Imagine a child wailing at daycare because he wasn’t picked up on time. It’s a big deal for him, but a small scheduling hiccup for his parents. Intrigued, they capture his “outsized” reaction on camera. This video is later circulated in group chats and posted on social media. Something critical has happened here. According to Lin, an embarrassing moment may create feelings of shame in private. But, once it’s public, shame turns into humiliation by definition. Parents may look back at these videos fondly but children, upon becoming aware and conscious, may not. “This impacts a child’s impression of their parents. Why did they post this video? Did they think it was ok? Did they care about me? As children become aware of others’ opinions of them, some may laugh it off but others could experience humiliation. They may also feel hurt and angry that their parents are active participants in sharing their embarrassment,” Lin said. “Frequent exposure to social media also shapes a child's impression of the world and heightens social comparisons. A child may start basing their self-worth on the perceptions of others through comments and likes. Is their world kind or critical? How should they behave to be ‘worthy’ to this world?” Of course, children sometimes forget. That’s a valid argument. However, Lin stressed that emotionally significant events can go unreported when children aren’t of the developmental age to do so, only to show up down the line. “How might these incidents manifest? If I have to do public speaking, I may be crippled by fear because I think I’ll be laughed at. I’m having difficulty, but keep things to myself as I don’t feel I can trust my parents with my vulnerable feelings.” Such internal pressures and stressors, when snowballed, become risk factors in different aspects of life. POSTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA MINDFULLY What’s it like to have your existence documented, starting with an ultrasound scan? Or to receive hundreds of comments on Instagram before you learned to be self-conscious? We never had to contend with this, but this generation of children someday will. “We don’t really have an answer at this point. Because of the lack of long-term studies, we’re subjected to these unknowns,” Lin conceded. “Even if a child says they’re okay, their consent isn’t informed because they cannot fully appreciate the long-term effects of their decisions. So the responsibility falls on adults and parents to consider the consequences and serve their best interest.” Asked about ways to better navigate social media, she acknowledged that while most parents are well-meaning, being mindful of their intentions can go a long way. “It’s very normal to (post on social media) without much thought. So we’re saying, can we pause before hitting the ‘share’ button? Would I be okay if someone took and shared a video of me in this manner? If I’m sharing a cute moment, does it have to be a video of them in distress? If I’m keeping my family updated, does it need to be this video? If it’s for a keepsake, does it need to be public?” For instance, making an Instagram account private or using the “close friends” function limits their content to a smaller and more trusted audience. If it’s available to the general public, sensitive information such as full names, birthdays, schools, location tags, and even children’s faces can be concealed. “To err on the side of caution, never share compromising videos or photos that are potentially embarrassing and humiliating. Think of it this way: If a future school, scholarship board, or employer sees these, what kind of impression are they going to form?” These considerations may seem far-fetched but, ultimately, we can foresee the implications of a child’s digital footprint no more than we foresaw technological leaps in the last decade.

Heightened anxiety and uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with the challenges of having a new baby, can significantly affect the mental health of mothers. (Photo: iStock/kieferpix) Before the pandemic upended our lives, pregnancy – and the postpartum period – was already a stressful and life-changing event for women. But add a global pandemic to the backdrop, and the extra stress and unexpected challenges that come with having a baby can take a significant toll on the mental health of new mothers. According to a 2021 study by the National University of Singapore Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies , postpartum depression (PPD) is a debilitating condition on the rise, both globally and in Singapore, especially during the first year after childbirth. A mother with PPD would display longer and more pronounced symptoms of the “baby blues”, such as feelings of hopelessness, sadness and severe mood swings. It can happen to both first-time mothers as well as those who’ve had children. According to Healthline.com, while the “baby blues”, which refers to a short-term bout of general anxiety, stress and sadness after birth, would typically go away after 10 to 14 weeks postpartum, PPD can stay on for months (or years) if not treated. Comparing data from January to September this year against the same period in 2020, psychiatrist Dr Chua Tze-Ern, who’s the head and senior consultant of Women’s Mental Wellness Service at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH), said the number of women who were diagnosed with PPD under KKH’s Postnatal Depression Intervention Programme has doubled. “Many women stay silent over their mental health struggles as they are afraid they will be judged as weak-minded or unfit mothers,” said psychotherapist Silvia Wetherell, a certified perinatal mental health counsellor at Alliance Counselling. Postpartum depression can have serious negative and long-lasting effects for both the mother and the child, she added. The challenges of the pandemic have added to this. “The reality facing most families in Singapore is that they cannot get the practical and emotional support they would have available, pre-pandemic,” said Wetherell. There are also other unique challenges, such as the loss of income when a partner loses their job and increasing difficulties of working from home while juggling a newborn. ANXIETY BEFORE THE BABY IS BORN The stress that builds up during pregnancy may sometimes sow the seeds for PPD to occur after childbirth. For example, reading the news about the increase in local COVID-19 cases may cause anxiety levels in mothers to go up, said Wetherell. Another instance: The unpredictable availability of a doula (a person who provides support during pregnancy) to assist during delivery, Wetherell said, even though a couple may have spent weeks working on a birth plan. Generally, on top of the characteristic stresses of pregnancy, women now have additional worries about keeping safe and well, said KKH’s Dr Chua. “To avoid getting COVID-19, they may need to stay away from family and friends, and have fewer chances of enjoying shared meals and activities before their baby comes along.” The resultant stress and isolation of these pregnant women may increase their risk of antenatal depression, which is in turn a major risk factor for postnatal depression, she added. RESTRICTED ACCESS TO POST-BIRTH SUPPORT No one could have anticipated the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic would hinder a woman’s access to postpartum help and support. The unpredictable nature of the pandemic means many mothers can end up feeling powerless, said Wetherell. “The use of confinement nannies, cleaners, extended family and friends to help with the baby, who play a role in the transition to motherhood has become very restricted,” she said. Dr Chua explained that families living overseas, as well as confinement nannies that usually come from Malaysia, and foreign domestic helpers, would have had a harder time coming to Singapore. And yet, these now-limited resources are important for new mothers to recover from depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress, said Wetherell. AN OVERWHELMING FEAR OF GETTING INFECTED This is a big worry for mums, who are also anxious about what being infected with COVID-19 would mean for their baby, said Assoc Prof Helen Chen, Head and Senior Consultant at KKH, on the Healthxchange website. “Some women have become so anxious that they have resorted to wearing gloves or masks – even at home – when attending to their baby,” she said. Other sources of stress, added her colleague Dr Chua, include social restrictions and home-based learning for school-going children, in which families have to stay home together in high-stress situations for extended hours. Similarly, Wetherell told CNA Women that the most dominant theme she has observed in her clinical experience is the “compounded and crushing weight” of losses faced by mothers, referring to new mums missing things like not having a first month celebration or the lack of meet-ups to get out of the house and socialise. BREASTFEEDING DIFFICULTIES ARE A CONCERN Stricter access to hospitals and social distancing measures in the community can affect a mother’s access to breastfeeding support and resources. A 2015 study in the Journal of Advanced Nursing found that postpartum depression may be more common in women who attempt to breastfeed but decide to stop due to difficulties such as pain, breast infection, low milk production and problems with latching. While breastfeeding difficulties have not resulted in a rise of PPD cases, the pandemic has added a new dimension to the challenges, said Doris Fok, Lactation Consultant at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. Not being able to get confinement help, said Fok, combined with a reduced number of visitors allowed in hospital-based lactation clinics, can create a new layer of stress and anxiety. “Even more so now, there is a need for community-based lactation services,” she said, adding that women can turn to the non-profit organisation Breastfeeding Mothers’ Support Group for help. GET ONLINE SOCIAL SUPPORT Reduced access to physical and in-person support doesn’t mean that new mums are completely cut off. Those who have gone online have benefited. In April, the NUS Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies (NUS Nursing) released the results of a study that showed peer support, mostly through the use of WhatsApp, can help mothers guard against the baby blues and PPD. The study is part of ongoing research to understand the long-term effects of a “large-scale peer volunteer programme” on mothers using a mobile app. The study followed 138 mothers in Singapore who scored nine or above (read: high risk) on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale within the first few weeks of childbirth. It matched the mothers to peer support in the form of 20 trained volunteers who had themselves experienced and recovered from PPD. The mums, who did weekly sessions with the volunteers over the phone or through mobile apps, expressed a “sense of gratification” and “had reduced negative feelings after continuous peer support”. “We found that new mothers who received the technology-based peer support had a 20 per cent reduced risk of developing postpartum depression, 9 per cent reduced risk of postpartum anxiety and 8 per cent reduced risk of loneliness at three months postpartum,” said Dr Shefaly Shorey, an assistant professor at NUS Nursing, in the study. Separately, telehealth services too, can work well for new mothers, especially if they prefer to stay home for a consultation during the pandemic. Zoom calls can be very useful in lowering the threshold for new mothers to seek help as it may not be easy to leave a newborn at home to travel to the obstetrician's office for a physical consult, explained Dr Ng Kai Lyn, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at the Advanced Centre for Reproductive Medicine ( ACRM) Gleneagles. “I have worked with many women who breastfeed during a counselling session or even change nappies when there is no backup carer for the baby,” said Wetherell , adding that in-person sessions are still recommended for more complex and severe cases such as psychosis or those with suicidal thoughts. “Sometimes all that is needed is an avenue for mothers to openly ventilate and talk through their emotions, and be told that she is not alone in this journey,” added Dr Ng. LESS STIGMA OVER POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION The prolonged pandemic has put a spotlight on mental health now more than ever,” said Dr Ng of ACRM Gleneagles, saying that this has led to increasing awareness of PPD on social media. When women (and their partners) recognise that PPD is an important issue, they have a lower threshold when it comes to addressing it, she added. The pandemic has provided a less stigmatised path to discuss postpartum depression, said Wetherell. “Women who have experienced and recovered from PPD are more ready to share their stories, showing others that it is right to speak up about having symptoms and to actively seek care, in the same way as for any other illnesses,” said KKH’s Dr Chua. It is important to remember that early recognition is key. Tap on your social support network of family and friends, and if that doesn’t help, speak to a trusted obstetrician for professional help, recommended Dr Ng. “Seeking help is not a sign of weakness or being a bad mother,” she added.

Understanding this is key to tackling the phenomenon, experts tell CNA Women. Developing self-awareness, strategic counselling and taking on a mentor can help women become their most confident, self-assured selves, experts say. (Photo: iStock/Delmaine Donson) “People who meet me think that I’m a confident, independent woman. But those close to me know that at almost every point in my life, I’ve struggled with self-doubt,” Leanne Robers told CNA Women. Robers, 37, is a co-founder at She Loves Tech, a platform for women-led tech startups, and a trained psychotherapist. She’s also a graduate of the Barack Obama Foundation’s Leaders programme and an experienced mentor, having been involved in accelerator programmes at Facebook and the Singapore Tourism Board. An impressive resume, to be sure, and yet, Robers joins a growing number of the world’s population who report experiencing “imposter syndrome”, a phenomenon characterised by intellectual self-doubt and one that could have a debilitating effect on a person’s mental health. The imposter phenomenon was first described in the 1970s, in a well-known study conducted by psychologists Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes. While both men and women can display signs of imposter syndrome, it occurs “with much less frequency in men and when it does occur (in men), it is with much less intensity”, the study found. It also characterised the group who most exhibit signs of imposter syndrome as “high-achieving” women – namely those who are highly educated and respected in their professional fields. CNA Women talked to local experts to find out if this remains the case today in Singapore – and why. WHAT IS IMPOSTER SYNDROME? “Imposter syndrome is the experience of feeling like a fraud – one feels that he or she is not as competent as others perceive them to be or believe they have simply gotten by so far by luck,” said Sophia Goh, principal counsellor at Sofia Wellness Clinic. It occurs “mostly among high achievers who are unable to internalise and accept their success, (but) it can affect anyone no matter their social status, work background, skill level, or degree of expertise”, she added. Shilpa Jain, co-founder at the online counselling service Talk Your Heart Out who also experiences imposter syndrome, said it “starts as a niggling worry about your own capabilities”. “In work for example, you might feel that you aren’t as skilled as your colleagues. That then builds into a belief that you have to work harder to cover up your lack of ability and you wind up constantly thinking that you’re not as good as others believe you are. “Even when you do succeed and others praise your accomplishments, you end up believing that it’s all because you were lucky or because you’ve been working harder than your colleagues,” she told CNA Women. Both Goh and Jain said the phenomenon appears more pervasive in women than men, although the latter noted that “this could reflect reluctance to seek help among men”. WHY WOMEN ARE MORE AT RISK Dr Katrina Gisbert-Tay, a medical doctor with a background in psychology and a wellbeing coach with The Coach Partnership, said “different factors such as one’s upbringing, culture and past experiences can play a part in shaping and reinforcing” one’s feelings of inadequacy. For women, their upbringing may have exposed them to beliefs and thought patterns that discriminate against their gender, making them “at higher risk” of the overwhelming self-doubt characteristic of imposter syndrome, said Talk Your Heart Out counsellor Jeanette Houmayune. For example, some women may have grown up listening to “war stories of their mothers, aunties and teachers about gender discrimination at the workplace and so ... they drive themselves to study hard … to prove they are as good as or better than the boys”, said Houmayune. “Over time, this competitive streak may turn into an unhealthy pursuit of setting ridiculously high standards of performance,” she added. Goh pointed out that discriminatory standards continue to be pervasive in society today. For one, the “longstanding fight for women to belong in the workplace … still remains a challenge in some societies”, she said. For example, when women are successful at work, it makes them less likeable, not more. “Women who are applauded for delivering results at work are also labelled as being ‘too aggressive’, ‘out for herself’, ‘difficult’ and ‘abrasive’, whereas men behaving similarly may be praised as being ‘confident’ or ‘sure of himself’,” said Goh. Existing views of women as the nurturing gender also places pressure on women to perform as primary caregivers in their families, as opposed to men, who are still seen in many societies as the main financial providers, said Houmayune. “While they may be just as competent if not more competent than their male co-workers, women may shun high-profile projects or other opportunities for career advancement as they feel less deserving or even insecure in managing the demands of career and family,” said Houmayune. And when they get promoted, there are women who give up their leadership roles after being made to feel like they are not giving their best at work. “They may receive sexist comments such as ‘she needs to rush back home to her kids – best for a guy to take over this tight-deadline project’,” Houmayune said. Women from minority races, as well as expatriates, may experience imposter syndrome “more acutely”, said Houmayune. “While Singapore prides itself on its multicultural society, diversity and inclusivity practices may vary across organisations, and some minority women may feel like they were hired or promoted to be the token minority member of the team – not for their qualifications and experience. “Others may not be affirmed of their strong work performance due to the racist or nationalist attitudes of some managers, leading to exacerbated feelings of self-doubt,” the counsellor said. Houmayune, a former lecturer at a local polytechnic, also noted that graduates who went to an Institute of Technical Education or a polytechnic before attending university “harbour self-limiting beliefs” when working alongside peers who went to junior college. “In spite of having the same degree qualifications, some may continue to carry the burden of emotional baggage from being labelled ‘slow’ or ‘stupid’ in their formative years, and may still continue to feel judged and insecure. “This may keep them second-guessing their self-worth as an equally competent contributing member of the work team with thoughts like ‘I don’t know enough’ or ‘I can’t make it’,” she said. Employees who come from marginalised backgrounds may echo these feelings, said Houmayune, citing those who are the first graduates in their families and lack a strong family role model to guide them towards their career aspirations. “In such cases, they may attribute their job and subsequent achievements to sheer luck, rather than their ‘blood, sweat and tears’. They may also limit their career progress as they feel a strange guilt that their remuneration far exceeds their humble expectations,” she said. HOW TO DEAL WITH SELF-DOUBT Many women aren’t aware that they’re experiencing imposter syndrome when they first show up in consulting rooms, experts said. It often takes a professional therapist, counsellor or coach to recognise the signs, help them understand the conditions that lead them to feel inadequate and undeserving, and repair the beliefs and thought patterns that are causing unnecessary stress and anxiety. One way that they do is, is through cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Jain said she had 10 sessions in total with her counsellor – weekly at first, then monthly – after which she found herself with markedly improved productivity and self-confidence. “A counsellor using CBT will identify the client’s thought patterns and challenge them to substantiate their assumption by prompting the client to find evidence for it. “ My counsellor did this with me over a few sessions exploring different facets of my life, for example, personal and professional relationships, goals and even childhood, and drawing connections between them,” she said. Dr Gisbert-Tay also uses CBT with her clients, many of whom are leaders in the workplace. Clients need to be made aware of the difference between facts and beliefs that are merely unhelpful judgements they make about themselves, she said. For example, women are often heard saying “I just got lucky … I don’t know why I’m here” after they’ve been given a promotion or appointed to a new position, when the fact is that they have the achievements, skills and hard work to show for it, she said. Robers told CNA Women she conducts workshops using the concept of “automatic negative thoughts” or ANTs. “These are beliefs that we tell ourselves but that are not true. Recognise the ANTs in your life, such as ‘I’m not good enough’, ‘I’m stupid’ and ‘I have to be a good daughter, wife, leader or mother or I will have failed in life’,” she said. Then, participants are taught to transform their ANTs into PETs or “positive empowering thoughts”. “For example, if you were disappointed in a task or project that you did, you can say: ‘Yes, I didn’t do as well as I had hoped but here are three things I learned and those lessons were worth the journey’,” said Robers. There are also ways to overcome self-doubt on your own. Experts said women, particularly in Asia, often believe that they have to be humble when it comes to their successes. “We get really uncomfortable when we're acknowledging our achievements, because we often feel like it's bragging, but we need to distinguish prideful statements, which can be detrimental, from honest ones,” said Robers. If you find it hard to acknowledge and speak about your achievements, Robers suggests a simple but empowering technique: Read your resume so you can be reminded of all that you have achieved. “Sometimes, when I’m coaching women leaders, I have to just ask them to read their CV. I do the same. When I’m feeling like ‘I don’t deserve to be here’, I go back and read my own resume,” she said. Experts also urged companies to develop and nurture a coaching or mentoring culture in the workplace. “Taking a look at the culture in the organisation is paramount,” said Dr Gisbert-Tay. “What are the standards of success and leadership in the organisation? Does it support diversity and inclusion of thought, identity and leadership styles? \"I have seen a positive impact in companies where women support and mentor other women, providing a safe space to share their experiences with vulnerability and authenticity.\" Women can also seek out friends and peers to make up their “personal board of advisors”, said Robers. These are people you trust in different aspects of your life, including personally and professionally, who can “hold up a mirror in front of you to show you the truth”, such as the skills and achievements you can’t see for yourself. Finally, Robers said, when feeling out of place in a meeting or at an event, it is useful to think about your differences as strengths. “It’s okay if you’re the only woman, if you look different from everyone else or if you’re much younger than the rest of the crowd. Leverage what makes you unique. “If I’m in a room full of men in tech, I know as a woman I have a unique perspective and voice, and I make sure to bring that to the table.” Dr Gisbert-Tay hopes that through her work, she can nurture more individuals into women who “love and accept themselves for who they are ... and believe in their self-worth”. “When she walks into a room, she walks with her head up and her eyes bright. She radiates confidence and self-assuredness. She is not perfect and loves her perfectly imperfect self,” she said.

CNA Women looks at how you can truly embrace your mental health days. In partnership with UOB. Self-care is all about taking good care of yourself, and intentionally finding the balance that prioritises your mental wellness. (Photo: iStock/Pornpimon Rodchua) After close to two years of working from home, I can safely say that finding the balance between work and life has been challenging. Knowing where to draw the boundaries between rest time and work is easier said than done. And yet, that’s the key to protecting my mental health. Have I done enough work for the day? How much rest is too much indulgence? Is it okay to completely “switch off” from work during a day off? Should I feel guilty for spending a certain amount of my salary on self-care? And what constitutes a healthy dose of self-care? Benedict Lim, the chief executive officer and chief psychologist at iGROW , described the pressure of responding to work when you’re on leave as an “ always on ” culture , where employees may find it challenging to get their much needed downtime. “ If an employee has a track record of responding and working on designated work leave or downtime, it is natural for reporting managers to be asking, and to continue asking – spiralling into a cycle of expectations by both employee and employer to an 'always on' culture,” said Lim. “Poor mental wellbeing over a long period of time may lead to burnout, depression, anxieties and other associated mental illness,” he added. Perhaps that’s why, in a recent joint survey done by cloud technology company Oracle and HR research and advisory firm Workplace Intelligence, 68 per cent of 1,000 Singapore respondents said 2021 was the most stressful year at work ever. Moreover, 58 per cent of those surveyed struggled more with mental health at work in 2021, compared to 2020. So how do we find the sweet spot for self-care? And how do we carve out time for it? “It can be an incredibly challenging task. Women are often burning the candle on both ends, not just having to manage a career, but also carrying the invisible (emotional) load of making sure the household runs well and that everyone in the family is taken care of,” said Sophia Goh, principal counsellor at Sofia Wellness Clinic. BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT FINDING THE BALANCE Self-care essentially means taking care of ourselves – our physical, intellectual, emotional, and social needs – so that we can be as healthy as possible, said Goh. “One of the biggest realisations all women should have is that one needs to find a happy balance between what one wants to do – and what one needs to do,” said Rashmi Kunzru, a counsellor and life coach at Talk Your Heart Out, an online counselling service. Think of our wellbeing as a cup full of water. “Many of our responsibilities, tasks and activities drain that cup of water, leaving it empty. We need to make time to do things that fill up the cup again, nourishing our wellbeing. This is self-care,” she explained. To help address stress and burnout, it’s important to intentionally create small pockets of time to attend to your own self, advised Kunzru. It is an important aspect of finding an internal balance which promotes health and wellbeing. Start by scheduling time for self-care into your calendar, said Kunzru, or sharing your intent to make time for self-care with your family and colleagues. “This will increase your own commitment towards self-care, and it will also set boundaries for other people,” she added. BUDGETING FOR SELF-CARE What does the state of your finances have to do with your mental wellbeing? For one, not needing to worry about your current and future expenses will give you peace of mind. For another, being able to manage your budget well means you can freely indulge in self-care activities such as taking a short holiday or enjoying a spa day. The UOB Lady’s Card, which is catered to women, allows you to earn cashback when you spend, including on self-care activities ranging from beauty to wellness, travel and family. A post shared by UOB Lady's Card (@uobladyscard) You can also tap on the UOB TMRW app (previously called UOB Mighty) to help you manage your budget. On the app (under the Rewards+ tab), you can expect the “largest merchant rewards programme in Singapore”, the bank said in a press release. This is part of UOB’s recent tie-up with lifestyle and smart payment app Fave, where you can score deals related to wellness, beauty, food and more. The rewards you earn would translate into savings that could go into your self-care budget, in the form of UNI$ (you earn UNI$1 for every $5 spent) or rebates. You can easily view and track earned rewards and cashback per transaction on the app. But do remember that while self-care is crucial to our mental wellbeing, so too, is knowing that we have the what-ifs covered: Hospitalisation, critical illness and disability, and whether your family can survive if you were to lose your income. For peace of mind, Chung Shaw Bee, Head of Deposits and Wealth Management at UOB, has these tips: SELF-CARE TIP #1: PLAN A SHORT ESCAPE Getting away from your routine is always a good idea, no matter the location. “Perhaps it is the idea of being able to take time off from our usual commitments to pause and relax, and prioritise our well-being for a few days,” said Goh from Sofia Wellness Clinic. The key is to take a break from your regular routine. “It allows you to indulge in fresh rituals and practices which are relaxing and nourishing for your physical, psychological and spiritual well-being,” Kunzru added. A staycation is an excellent opportunity to “fill up” whatever has been depleted, she added. Whether you do a hotel staycay, a holiday overseas (now that the VTLs are opening up travel options to Singaporeans), or even spending it entirely at home, it’s the time you’re dedicating to this escape that counts. Just remember that for this escape to work, how you do it matters. Said Goh: “It doesn't really work if your mind is occupied with work or your household while on staycation.” SELF-CARE TIP #2: INVEST IN A NEW HOBBY “Hobbies are a very important part of self-care,” said Kunzru. “They relax us because we enjoy them.” “Hobbies reduce our stress levels, give us a sense of purpose in life (outside of work), develop new skills and help us form friendships with people who share our interests.” A new hobby allows you to broaden your own boundaries and experiences, and increases self-confidence and self-esteem, she added. Learning something new is, in itself, the act of setting aside time for yourself to have a moment in the week that prioritises your own interests and wellbeing, Goh said. SELF-CARE TIP #3: SET ASIDE SMALL POCKETS OF TIME IN THE DAY Kunzru suggested some ideas: SELF-CARE TIP #4: TRY VOLUNTEERING Experts told CNA Women that research has shown that giving back not only makes us happier, it reduces depression and has a positive impact on our overall wellbeing and self-esteem. When you feel more positive about yourself by giving to others, said Goh, you will also start noticing more positivity around you, which bolsters your emotional well-being. “It is a good way to help the community and also take care of our own emotional needs,” she added. Giving back also helps you to stop focusing on your own issues, giving you the space to focus on causes that you are passionate about, said Kunzru. “While we cannot solve all the problems of the world, we should approach volunteering with the mindset that every little bit helps,” she said. For example, giving.sg is a good place to start, suggested Kunzru, adding that there are multiple avenues in Singapore for those interested in volunteering. The platform allows you to explore more than 300 online volunteering opportunities, from video editing to tele-befriending services. SELF-CARE TIP #5: TAKE LEAVE FROM WORK (AND DON’T FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT) When was the last time you enjoyed a day off – without thinking about work at all? According to a report by NTUC LearningHub on mental wellness at the workplace, 58 per cent of employees engage in leaveism, working outside official office hours or even on their leave days to catch up on work. Additionally, 40 per cent of employees suffer from presenteeism, reporting to work even though they were feeling unwell in order to cope with the workload and deadlines. “In today’s reality, the biggest concern that hinders a properly executed leave day is workload, which is exacerbated by the fact that when you do take time off, you can see the work piling up in real-time on your phone,” said Lim of iGROW. But time-off can be a fantastic way to ignite innovation, he said, and bring the next great idea to your organisation. He added that poor mental health also affects one’s physical well-being, leading to unhealthy lifestyles and chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer. “In the long run, (having time-off) will be beneficial for the employee and the employer alike because it helps to reduce ill-health and absenteeism,” said Lim, adding that companies also end up paying the price.

CNA Women finds out why these feelings don’t have to overtake your life, and what you can do to cope with mum guilt. Mothers experience \"mum guilt\" when they feel like they've fallen short in their role as a mother, despite wanting the best for their children. (Photo: iStock/globalmoments) It doesn’t take much for a mum to feel guilty, especially when it comes to your children. Think about all the times you’ve felt you’ve fallen short as a mother – when your kids act up, when they fall behind in school, when you’re unable to be physically present at home, or even if you’re working from home, having to ignore a crying child to attend to a Zoom call. That’s mum guilt. You’ve also probably lost count of the instances you’ve felt pangs of guilt when you see how well your friends’ kids are doing in school and life – when you barely have time to see to everyday issues yourself. It seems like mums just can’t get a break. So what is mum guilt, and why do so many women feel this way, so much of the time? It’s an issue that was discussed on the new CNA Women podcast Womankind. The episode looked at why women fall into the cycle of self-blame and guilt, how it affects our mental health and what steps we can take to get rid of mum guilt. Listen to the full Womankind episode here: THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF MUM GUILT According to Silvia Wetherell, a certified perinatal mental health counsellor at Alliance Counselling, m um guilt is “more prevalent with the first child and in the early formative years”. But even so, there’s no “expiry date” to when such feelings will stop. Guilt can in fact start from as early as conception, she said, such as forgetting to take your folic acid supplements, which prevent brain and spinal birth defects in the unborn baby. “(Your) mind can always come up with reasons as to why (you are) failing in some way – not to mention the children, who can ‘press the guilt button’ with their words as they grow up,” she said. For many women, mum guilt often takes the form of feeling like they’re “failing their duty” as a mother or wife – especially in an Asian context where mothers are expected to be responsible for child-minding. “ When my boys were very young, all it took was for someone to ask me why I didn’t cook but bought lunch instead,” said Yasmin Begum, a mum of four. “It might have been a passing comment, but for me, it confirmed that I was a useless mum.” Begum founded Away From Mum Guilt in 2018, a support group to help mothers cope better with such negative feelings. “The whole cooking chore hung over my head like a rock every day,” she said. “Because it was difficult for me to care for my toddler and my active preschooler – and cook regularly – it made me feel useless that I could not cope.” And that’s the nature of mum guilt: While it can lead to “very positive actions” as it can guide ethical and moral behaviour, it can also lead to “unrealistic expectations”, said Wetherell. “When a mum perceives herself as having failed in some way, often the guilty pangs show up, as well as the self-critical thoughts such as ‘I am a terrible mother’ or ‘I’m not cut out for this’, she explained. For Dixie Sng, a mother of two and head of operations at a ride-hailing company, the “greatest guilt” she feels is when her two-and-a-half-year-old daughter tears up during bedtime. “She would ask for more bedtime stories, or ask to use the loo repeatedly, or say that she is hungry or thirsty right before she falls asleep.” Jolin Nguyen, a mother of one and managing director of a HR technology solutions company, said she typically experiences mum guilt when she’s “not performing up to my own expectations or the expectations of others”. This includes leaving her two-year-old daughter to go to work when she’s sick. “The guilt came because I can’t be the one who calms her down,” she said. For Fannie Soubiele, the worst pangs of guilt came when she was facing breastfeeding issues with her first son. “ I did everything I could: Ate supplements, saw consultants and doctors, did acupuncture, and even sent my son for a tongue-tie release surgery ( a procedure to lift the tongue) when he was only two months old,” said the mum of two who ’ s in charge of startup success at a tech company. “I wanted to give him the best, but it just didn’t work,” she added. Soubiele stopped breastfeeding just as she needed to return to work – when her son was four months old. STAY-AT-HOME MUMS FEEL THE GUILT TOO While working mums are “more likely to express this uncomfortable emotion”, Wetherell pointed out that stay-at-home mums can experience such guilt just as often. Stay-at-home mums tend to feel guilty for “wanting to have time away from their children” and will talk about “not having legitimate reasons to take a break”, she explained. Begum agreed, citing her observations from running her Away From Mum Guilt support group. This could be anything from making a coffee run to taking time off for an evening jog, she said. Wetherell added that the circumstances that could trigger mum guilt in stay-at-home mums is “truly endless”. “They may feel like they are not as patient as they should be (due to caring for the child around the clock), not helping the child’s development enough (such as not having started piano lessons yet), not being present enough (for example, having a child-free lunch with a friend),” she added. “Sadly, stay-at-home mums can hear derogatory comments like ‘what do you do all day?’, which reinforces the idea that she is never doing enough, or being good enough,” said Wetherell. “WE ARE OUR WORST CRITICS”: SOCIAL MEDIA IS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR Comparison kills, but it’s more detrimental when we “compare our behind-the-scenes with everyone else’s highlight reel”, Sng pointed out. Begum agreed that social media has been a big factor in this tendency to compare. “A mother’s guilt can be deepened by non-verbal cues or comments from family members, friends or the social media community,” she said. This then results in women being “hypersensitive” to every comment that comes along. For an overwhelmed mum, said Begum, seemingly harmless comments and advice such as “they are only young once” or “you will regret it later when they grow up” can snowball into something deeper. “ What we see on social media are just fragments – literally seconds – of someone else’s life. So many of the toughest moments in parenting are not shared on social media, but that does not mean that they don’t happen,” said Sng. “But most of the time, it stems from within. We are our worst critics, and we add on to our fears,” Begum said. “We are so critical of ourselves and try to… give our kids the perfect childhood that we forget we are enough for the people that matter.” ADDED CHALLENGES FROM THE PANDEMIC While working from home has granted more flexibility to caregivers, working mothers often find themselves struggling to juggle more tasks at hand – the topic of mum guilt continues to come up at “almost every counselling session”, Wetherell told CNA Women. For instance, Sng said working from home was in fact harder and sometimes created more mum guilt. “I cannot be fully present with my daughter even though I am physically next to her. When she tries to “invade” a video call, I have to ignore her,” she said. Begum added that she too, went through “a depressive state” when her husband started working from home and her children, were on home-based learning during Singapore’s circuit breaker. “It was just noisy, and I felt trapped in my own home,” she said. Meanwhile, Soubiele’s younger son, who was born during the pandemic, has “never had a social life”, she said. “I’m worried about the impact on him and what I, as a mum, can do about it.” HOW WOMEN CAN COPE WITH MUM GUILT When the “spiral of guilt” builds up, said Wetherell, it can deplete a mother physically and emotionally, and take a toll on their mood. “It can even lead to negative behaviours to try and get rid of the guilt, such as turning guilt into anger, blaming others or self-punishment.” What can mums do to ensure that mum guilt doesn’t spill over to their relationships or other aspects of their lives? The mothers share their personal tips: It’s important to “ recalibrate expectations'' and recognise that you are only human after all, said Wetherell. “It’s okay to not be perfect and make mistakes.” She also advised mums not to use their guilt as a “motivational stick” to beat them into becoming a better person. “Acknowledge when you haven’t been at your best, forgive yourself, learn from it and implement those positive lessons in the future,” she said. To help you manage and recognise feelings of guilt, Wetherell suggests asking yourself questions such as “Is there something helpful about this guilt?”, “Do I need to recalibrate my actions in some way?” or “Is this a learning opportunity?”. Then you can take what is helpful about it, she said, make some adjustments and take positive action. And don’t underestimate the power of a supportive community – surround yourself with compassionate, honest, and non-judgemental friends who understand what it’s like to be in your shoes, said Wetherell. “Even if a woman quits her job to stay at home, there is no guarantee she will feel less guilty in the long run. In fact, she may become resentful for making sacrifices that are not respectful of her needs and wants as an individual,” she warned. Think of the big picture. “It’s healthier to make choices based on what matters to you and the kind of life you truly want to build,” said Wetherell.

CNA Lifestyle delves into this method of self-therapy. Writing a compassionate letter to yourself can reduce feelings of inadequacy, shame or insecurity, said Joseph Quek, a counsellor at online counselling service Talk Your Heart Out. (Photo: iStock/FreshSplash) When was the last time you wrote a letter to someone? If the thought of doing so is too old-school for you, it might be helpful to know that letter-writing has benefits beyond helping you work on your penmanship (or typing skills, if you prefer). For Sabrina Ooi, co-founder of mental health platform Calm Collective Asia, it was a way for her to process grief and loss, in particular, the death of a former boyfriend when she was 17. “I was still upset about the fact that he had passed away in his sleep. I didn’t know how to process (his death) at that time,” the 30-year-old told CNA Lifestyle. On top of that, Ooi was also coping with the loss of a friend through suicide. “I wrote a letter to each of them and (spent a few hours writing it). It was very emotional but liberating at the same time because it wasn’t something that I commonly talk about,” said Ooi. “That helped me recognise my remaining emotions and turn them into feelings of gratitude.” Afterwards, she burned the letters – and felt the emotional weight lift off her shoulders. “It felt like I was able to let go of emotions that I have been holding on to for a long time,” she added. “When you write it out, it also helps you to ‘edit’ your story to find a healthier relationship with the emotions you are feeling.” Letter writing was also cathartic for Nanny Eliana, one of the contributors to the Singapore anthology Letter to My Mother, in which 20 authors wrote about growing up with their mothers in the form of a letter. The 42-year-old, who’s the founder of regional healthcare communications agency Bridges M&C, told CNA Lifestyle that she was adopted as a baby as her biological parents could not afford to have a third child. She only learnt of her adoption when she was 18. Thereafter, she was sent by her adoptive family to live with her biological mother for eight years until her death. Writing a letter to her, said Eliana, was a culmination of all the work she had put into her mental health, including therapy. Joseph Quek, a counsellor from online counselling service Talk Your Heart Out, says aching for that one last conversation with someone or having emotions that are still felt strongly long after the event has passed, can indicate an “unfinished” experience or relationship. Letter writing, whether you’re doing it by hand or email, provides that emotional release, enabling you to lay out your feelings, thoughts, hopes and regrets, said Quek. So how do you start? That first step is always the hardest. But Phyllis Bah, a psychologist from Psychology Blossom, said having the complete picture helps. “Recall any specific incident or behaviour that contributed to the feelings you have, and put into perspective, the before, during, and after,” she said. If you need inspiration, Maniesha Blakey , a counsellor from psychology consultancy Mind What Matters, said song lyrics or a piece of writing that corresponds closely to your feelings may help. “Write in drafts. You can begin by noting down a few bullet points and using these to expand into a letter. Write and rewrite over a few days before you settle on a final version, as you are likely to see new ways to build upon or simplify the letter,” she suggested. Quek recommended setting aside time, a quiet space and removing distractions to ensure a conducive environment for writing. Then, find your reason for writing it, and pick a medium. “The crux of letter writing is arguably about getting the message to the intended recipient. Whether handwritten (or typed), it ultimately boils down to the medium that you are most comfortable with that enables you to express yourself best,” he said. CNA Lifestyle spoke to counsellors and psychologists to find out about the mental health benefits of letter writing – both to someone and to yourself. Here are some instances where it could help your mental health and bring you a little peace. IF YOU WANT TO TELL YOUR CHILD YOU LOVE THEM “In typical Asian families, parents tend to display love through their actions, such as buying gifts or through acts of service, such as working hard to bring food to the table,” Quek said. “For children whose love language is words of affirmation, they may not have received love through the medium which speaks to them the most,” he said, adding that receiving a letter from a parent with words of affirmation, encouragement and affection can be particularly impactful. The concept of love language originated from the book The 5 Love Languages, famously written by relationship counsellor Gary Chapman in 1992. Claudia Doig, a clinical psychologist of Psychology Blossom, highlighted that children and adolescents can benefit from receiving letters from their parents. “In small children, this is usually achieved through making the letter funny. For example, when getting your child into the habit of brushing their teeth regularly, you may write a letter to your child on how much that toothbrush misses them and how lonely it feels when it doesn’t get used for a day,” Doig said. Meanwhile, Blakey said that writing letters to your child gives another perspective of your life and experiences as a parent. “It can be a heartwarming gesture to receive letters from parents celebrating stages and milestones in their lives. For parents who are more reticent, writing can be a medium through which they are able to express themselves more fully,” she said. Just remember, however, not to use letters to your children to share your problems as an adult or to criticise them, Doig cautioned. IF YOU WANT TO REDUCE TENSION AND RESOLVE A CONFLICT When conversations get heated between two parties, there are usually strong emotions involved, said Doig. “At those times, when it is hard to get through and be heard, it is much easier to write a letter where you can write at length about your feelings about the issue.” Quek suggested that you can pass the letter or read it out loud to the other party. He told CNA Lifestyle about a young boy who came to see him because of a strained relationship with his parents. He was not only having frequent arguments with them, but also becoming more withdrawn, as well as displaying violent tendencies towards his brother. “During therapy, it was clear that he had much to say to his parents. I got him to write a letter to pour out what he wanted to communicate to them. This provided him with the opportunity to communicate his thoughts and feelings in a safe space,” shared Quek. Later on, the boy read the letter to his parents, which led to more open conversations that improved their relationship. But do remember this rule when writing a letter to dissolve tension, said Doig. “It is important to not use letters to criticise or tell off a person. We usually use an entire therapy session to discuss them.” IF YOU WANT TO FORGIVE SOMEONE AND FIND CLOSURE Closure is possible if you are writing without any expectations from the other party, whether it is in the form of an acknowledgement or apology, said Blakey. “If the objective is to clarify your perspective and forgive, and not to accuse or blame, then it could help your mental health and well-being,” she said. Instead of closure, the letter may also be a way of getting some relief. However, if you are relying on getting a response to your letter, you’re unlikely to get closure, added Blakey. And although writing a letter for this purpose may help as a starting point to open up communication, you don’t have to resume a relationship with the other person if you don’t want to, Blakey reminded. What should you do with the letter after you’ve written it? You don’t have to send it. Quek said that the act of writing and addressing it to the person can already help with your overall wellbeing. “Forgiveness releases the pain we feel about the person,” he said. “It reduces negative emotions and prevents us from re-living the hurt.” But he also reminded that i t is equally important to forgive ourselves, especially when it comes to self-blame. If left unattended, these feelings can show up in the form of anger and depression which could lead to self-destructive behaviour.

Sarimbun Scout Camp where the writer attended a Vipassana meditation camp before the pandemic. (Photo: Joyce Yang) “Where on Earth is Sarimbun Scout Camp?” was the first thing my friends said when I told them I would be uncontactable for 10 days. The north of Singapore is often associated with animal farms and plant nurseries, but few know it is frequented by a small community that, once in a while, voluntarily drops everything to meditate for a hundred hours. The thought of spending 10 days in utter silence without devices, entertainment, hot showers, and even dinners is unnerving for many people. Yet it’s become an annual ritual for some. Before the pandemic struck, I had the pleasure of joining them for a Vipassana meditation camp. WHAT IS VIPASSANA? Vipassana means “insight” in Sanskrit. It means to see things as they really are by paying disciplined attention to our physical sensations. The practice stems from Buddhism but is secular, not unlike yoga. Proponents include Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Yuval Noah Harari, the author of Sapiens: A Brief History Of Humankind. Whether you’re attending the course in an idyllic farmhouse in New Zealand or a temple in Myanmar, the course schedule is identical across the globe: You wake up at 4am and basically spend the rest of the day meditating – either by yourself or in groups – or listening to teachers until lights out at 930pm. Two things stood out to me. One, we would meditate for 10 whole hours every day. Two, our last meal of the day would be served at 11am. This was glaring because, on any given day, I would still be working through my coffee at that time. We also had to abide by five precepts: 1. We shall not commit wrong speech, which explains why a vow of silence is warranted. This means not speaking, gesturing, writing notes or even making eye contact with another course mate. 2. We shall not take another being’s life. That includes mosquitoes and spiders and explains why only vegetarian meals will be served. 3. We shall not consume intoxicants that would disrupt your sobriety. That includes alcohol, drowsy medication and painkillers. 4. We shall not steal. 5. We shall not partake in sexual activity. On top of severing contact with the world, we would also have no access to books, magazines, films, podcasts, music and the news. Essentially, the course would starve our minds of information and entertainment in any way, shape or form. You would be forgiven for thinking this sounds like a cult. I did, too. But curiosity led me to Kranji MRT station on a Saturday morning, where I waited for a bus that would take me through a series of dirt roads to Sarimbun Scout Camp. There were about 20 of us. We were mostly made up of aunties and uncles in their fifties, a handful of millennials, and one elderly who, despite being English-illiterate, had flown to Singapore to attend the course. The course operates on a donation basis and funds collected on its last day will go towards organising the following one. Male and female coursemates were strictly separated. Our living quarters were minimal but adequate. Meals would be had at a tiny canteen. Air-conditioned dormitories came with bunk beds and slept up to six people each. Someone found a dead bird in the dingy shower facility which, might I add, does not have warm water. There was a lush backyard with a chance of squirrel and wild boar sightings. My roommates were a psychotherapist from Hong Kong, a yoga instructor from Spain, a local PR professional, an unemployed 27-year-old and a homemaker in the midst of relocating to Dubai. We enjoyed the last of human interaction before taking our vow of silence later that evening, and I wondered if all of us would make it to Day 10. DAYS 1 TO 3: ANAPANA The homemaker left after the first day. Honestly, I had a hunch she would because she was shocked when asked to surrender her phone the previous day. She might not have known what she had signed up for at all. Besides, being a mother of a young boy must make isolation all the more trying. The first three days were spent mastering Anapana, the observation of natural respiration. For 10 hours a day, I sat still and noticed how my breath felt on my upper lip. Does it feel tingly, warm, or cold? Did I inhale and exhale through the same nostril, and which one? I could easily think of a million better ways to spend 10 hours, but that’s not to say it was easy. On the contrary, it was colossally challenging. I’ve never registered how restless my mind is until I had to tame it. I could not help dozing off, adjusting my seating position, and opening my eyes to see if others were struggling, too. Instead, I would find my neighbour in the same upright posture every time; her laser-sharp focus was a mockery of my own “monkey” mind. At the end of the course, I would learn that she had spent a year meditating in a Japanese monastery where she endured sub-zero temperatures. Obviously, she had already played this game in “expert” mode. The cold showers and 4am call times took some getting used to, but were nothing compared to the overwhelming sense of disconnect. What is on the news today? Did anyone text, call or email me? Will they think I’m dead and file a police report? I spent all my free time walking the backyard enough times to memorise the flower species. I ran up and down the stairs in hopes of being less restless during meditation sessions. Whenever the clock struck 7pm, I heaved a sigh of relief. We would report to the auditorium for our virtual “debrief” of the day’s learnings. This was done through a different video recording every evening of the late SN Goenka, an Indian teacher of Vipassana meditation. It was a reprieve for the mind because, for an hour and 15 minutes, I could channel my attention to something other than the chaos in my head. It dawned on me how reliant I had grown on the media in everyday life. It is far easier to be absorbed in something, anything, than to be left alone with our own minds. DAYS 4 TO 10: VIPASSANA On the fourth day, we were ready to “graduate” from Anapana to Vipassana. Up until then, we had focused only on our noses and upper lips. From here on out, we would scan the entire body – from the top of our heads to the tips of our toes – for sensations. Our objective was to experience the itch, aches, cramps and numbness while remaining still as water. Whereas we fidgeted liberally before, there was now an unspoken rule to refrain. During the “seating of strong determination” at 6pm daily, the hall would be so silent I dared not swallow my saliva. The philosophy of Vipassana is this: When we crave comfort and reject unease, we exist either in wishful thinking or a fight-or-flight mode. But when we remain equanimous and trust that all physical sensations are impermanent, we are less enslaved to the tyranny of our reactive minds. Vipassana is a means of reprogramming our subconscious. When we are able to sit with unpleasant sensations, thoughts, and emotions; and accept that “this too shall pass”, we develop mental fortitude. This is perfect in theory but messy in practice. By day five, three people had left. I looked at their empty mats and thought: Should I throw in the towel too? At least I wouldn’t be the first to give up. I briefly entertained the idea. How I’ve missed my creature comforts, reality shows and the satisfying buzz of one phone notification after another. The poisons of modern society never seemed quite as delicious until I’ve had my fill of solitude. More than physical discomfort, silence also turned the volume up on our innermost thoughts and feelings. The pain was starting to manifest in both physical and psychological ways. One evening, I returned to my dormitory to find my roommate sobbing uncontrollably. The rest of us could do little besides offering her tissues and giving her space. This is not uncommon, we were warned. Who knows what could bubble to the surface when you’ve got nothing else to think about? My experience, while comparably calm, had its moments, too. A hundred hours of meditation has the power to excavate the most deeply seated of issues, particularly those I had never given the time of day and swept under the rug with work and a great many Eat, Pray, Love solo trips. When negative thoughts and complex emotions come up, we naturally try to control them. But Vipassana asks that we take a radically different approach: Let’s see how long this lasts. Sometimes, it was a breeze and the gong would go off before I knew it. Other times, I felt so unsettled I would excuse myself, take a cold shower, and wonder: What possessed me to come here? My question was, of course, rhetorical. The only way out was through, and by day ten, all of us were. I felt calm, light and clear-headed. It was as if my mind had undergone the biological equivalent of turning a computer off and on. Our vow of silence ended on the last morning, but we would only get our phones back when “booking out” the next day. Socialising again felt disorienting at first, but we quickly got into the groove of sharing our experiences. I thought it was wild that they differ so vastly across individuals. Some had highly realistic nightmares; others had out-of-body experiences. It became clear why a vow of silence was warranted. Had we been allowed to discuss, we would fall into the rabbit hole of comparison and expectations – the antithesis of Vipassana. A BOOT CAMP FOR THE MIND The firefighters have a term called “backdraft”. When they break down the door of a burning house, oxygen rapidly enters and meets the superheated gases to a violent explosion. Vipassana was like that for me – overdue but cathartic. I think of it as a boot camp for the mind, a fast from insidious addictions, and a chance to unlearn things which no longer serve us. In Singapore, the 10-day courses are still on pause. Unless you are open to attending one in Johor, you may have to check back here . I highly recommend one for anyone between jobs or on a sabbatical. A couple of my friends, who were just as surprised to know this experience exists in Singapore, had taken my word for it and never looked back. One of them has even made it a daily practice thereafter. Even if you have no experience with meditation, how often in life do you get to exist outside of your job, relationships, and others’ expectations? Rarely. Yet it is through the bare necessities that we have a chance at calm, insight, and self-knowledge. Copyright© Mediacorp 2024. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

What people forget is that you also need to take care of yourself, says Bella Khaja. 35-year-old entrepreneur Bella Khaja used to be a \"hustler\". Now she advocates for taking a pause. (Photo courtesy of Bella Khaja) As the owner of a marketing agency and digital academy, 35-year-old Bella Khaja was already struggling to ride the rapidly turning tides of the pandemic. Clients were scarce and any group workshops she managed to book often had to be suspended or moved online practically overnight due to restrictions. Then, she was served a quarantine order (QO). Bella was conducting a training session at a school when a member of her staff was notified that she was in the KTV COVID-19 cluster . The cluster was first discovered in July, sparking a probe into KTV lounges that were operating as food and beverage outlets. The cluster was closed on Sep 8 after 28 straight days of no new cases. “I was told she was in the cluster and had to be sent home immediately,” Bella told CNA Women in a virtual interview. “I had been in close contact with my staff and now I found myself in a room full of children. I was thinking, ‘what does this mean for the children?’ “There was a lot of anxiety. It caused a big ruckus.” Bella said before experiencing a quarantine order personally, she didn’t really understand what it meant. “Despite knowing about COVID-19 for two years now, I don’t think we have understood what really goes into a quarantine order. At first I thought, ‘What’s so difficult about being isolated?’” The first thing she struggled with was the dearth of useful and practical information. Despite thousands now having served quarantine due to the pandemic, Bella said research on what to expect turned up empty. At the time she could only find one article about quarantine orders and it hardly addressed her questions. “Even the related hashtags on Instagram had only food flatlays. “Some people might think of it as a staycation, as a break, and they might bring things to get rid of boredom. Their priority is to get rid of boredom,” she said. What she wished someone had told her to bring were things like health supplements and socks. “When you’re in an airconditioned room for long periods of time, you’re going to fall sick,” she said and that was what happened about 10 days into her quarantine at the Furama RiverFront hotel. Bella developed a flu and was transferred to a COVID-19 facility in Changi, where she was told her quarantine period could be extended. Bella had been counting the days to her exit swab, which if negative, would’ve allowed her release. The thought that she would be further removed from the world terrified her. “I had a meltdown when I heard that,” she said. “THE FEELING OF BEING TRULY ALONE” Bella said the biggest thing she wished she had been prepared for was loneliness. “The impact of isolation is the feeling of being truly alone,” she said. Even speaking to her husband and other family members on video calls was “not that helpful”. “I was serving quarantine during Hari Raya Haji and seeing my family members only reminded me that I was so far away,” Bella said. That, and the lack of information and community around the issue, led Bella to begin logging her experiences on Instagram , where she drew the attention of others serving their quarantine order or had family members who were. Each day, she posted Instagram Stories to give her followers a glimpse of life in quarantine, update on her progress, and to share her thoughts and emotions. Through Bella’s recordings, followers heard the multiple announcements residents received daily on the hotel’s public address system, saw how her meals were placed under a chair outside her room for her collection each day and watched her create alternative food options using a steamer her neighbour had gifted. Bella also went on hour-long Instagram Live videos with friends who interviewed her on her experience and discussed ways to make quarantine more bearable. These videos continued even after Bella’s quarantine period was over, but evolved into interviews with others who had their own “stories of resilience” to share. In these sharings, Bella said she strove to represent “what QO is really like by not painting a beautiful picture of it”. It comforted her in her loneliness and gave her a sense of purpose. “A girl thanked me because now she knew what her dad, who was serving QO at the same hotel, was eating because he didn’t tell her,” said Bella. One video, in which she warned people against falling sick during QO, hit 138,000 views, said Bella. “That’s just mad. But because I was crying in that video and I felt so sad watching it, I eventually deleted it. I couldn’t stomach watching myself at my lowest point. “I’m Type A and I’ve never really had a weak moment. QO made me vulnerable,” she said. Through her advocacy work, Bella made many friends. Predictably, she also received some negative responses. “I experienced gaslighting. Someone (from a neighbouring country) messaged me to tell me I should be thankful to even have a bed. She said … they didn’t have it easy,” Bella told CNA Women. “Even though I wasn’t being indulgent, it was still offensive to others. I felt I shouldn’t be attacked for sharing, but I also realised different people have different pressure points and that I had to be contextual with what I posted. The pandemic has exposed us to different stressors.” Bella began to make it a point to frame certain situations to be more compassionate towards others, but continued to share. “A lot of people don’t like to talk about negativity. I don’t like to either, but the reality is that I’m a human being and this is what being human means.\" “QUARANTINE IS NOT A STAYCATION” As the sole director of her company, Bella is responsible for the wellbeing and productivity of her team, and oversees all client projects. Being placed in quarantine put her in a spiral of guilt and anxiety. “I was honestly afraid of losing my jobs … I know there are people who use this time of isolation to get to know themselves better or even get away from problems. They use this isolation as a runaway tool. “But I wasn’t running away from anything. I was used to my routines,” said Bella. Sticking to her work routine, especially, proved almost impossible, thanks to environmental factors such as spotty Wi-Fi and constant interruptions due to medical checks and inspections. “If you’re in quarantine, I think you should be given 14 days of leave to focus on yourself. You can’t possibly be working full-on. There will be knocks on your door, there will be medical checks … so you have to be clear with your boss and colleagues – you’re not going to be 100 per cent yourself,” she said, adding that this also applies to those isolating themselves at home. For business owners, who “still have to work”, the reality is that some clients “may not be sympathetic to the cause – to them it’s business as usual”. But something had to give and so she put some work on hold, even if it came at a cost. “I took three weeks post-quarantine to just get back in the zone. And until today, I’m still picking up the pieces,” said Bella. Today, Bella continues to receive direct messages on social media from people who want to share their experiences with quarantine, home recovery and the COVID-19 situation in general. “Some people’s stories are just so sad. One piece of advice for those who know others who are going through quarantine: Be empathetic. Those in quarantine are not on staycation – they are going through a very difficult time. “Our society needs to be more forgiving. We are so demanding … Everyone is going through something. I think we need to be more considerate of their issues.” In the current COVID-19 climate, her company continues to be challenged to live up to its name – Nimble Marketing Consultancy – but the new Bella is making slower, more measured moves, even going back to school in a way, having signed up for former Girlboss and Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso's eight-week entrepreneurship course. From being a well-known “hustler” within her own circles, Bella said she now advocates for “taking a pause” and herself moves at a slower pace, at work and at home. “Even as a business owner, you don’t have to hustle every day. It’s okay if you’re not okay. To be a better business owner and a better leader, you have to take better care of yourself. “QO freed me from hustler mode. Ironically, isolation freed me.\" CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

CNA Lifestyle gets some advice on defusing anger-inducing situations, from queue cutting and reckless driving to noisy neighbours and... people who don't wear masks properly? (Photo: iStock/FilippoBacci) You’re frustrated. He’s boiling mad. And she just wants to kill someone (figuratively speaking). Everyone is on edge these days, going by the news reports we’ve read about altercations with security guards, healthcare workers being verbally abused, road bullies caught on camera and hot soup being flung for getting an order wrong. We just can’t seem to let things go. You’d have thought that after two years of living with fluctuating COVID-19 numbers and ever-changing rules, we’d have learned to go with the flow. Apparently not. Trying situations where patience is tested and tempers flare are aplenty in our daily lives. They don’t make it onto the news or social media platforms but that doesn’t mean they don’t occur. You know those triggers: The person who blasts videos on his handphone speaker; the one who cuts your queue, then feigns ignorance; rude email or text replies; drivers who drive like they own the road… the list goes on. CAUSES OF PANDEMIC RAGE The question is, are we becoming more impatient because of the pandemic? Have COVID-19-related restrictions added fuel to our already short fuse? Such behaviour isn’t new pre-pandemic, said Dr Lim Boon Leng, a psychiatrist from Gleneagles Hospital’s Dr BL Lim Centre For Psychological Wellness. What is new, though, is the way we have developed socially. “We have taken a more obey-the-rules or ‘law by law’ approach, rather than a graceful or empathetic one,” he said. “This results in us not putting ourselves in other people's shoes. We get easily riled up and feel that great injustice has befallen us when people don't follow the rules and get in our way.” He continued: “However, many rules in society are not in black and white, and are simply unspoken norms. Some people may be unaware of these rules and some may just outright not agree to adhere to them”. Take road rage, for instance, said Kayden Sharon Perera, a counsellor and psychotherapist at Talk Your Heart Out. It was already an issue before COVID-19 but “the pandemic has certainly induced more of such bad behaviour and road rage incidents”. “People are under pressure and angry about a number of things and situations, and driving is a perfectly designed situation to cause anger,” she said. “Because people are heading towards somewhere purposefully, when they get cut off by reckless drivers, they feel that their safety is being threatened or their lives have been made even more difficult by such behaviour. As such, they react with anger as a way to deal with the anxiety it has provoked,” said Perera. She continued: “The underlying stress, isolation and trauma during the pandemic are impacting on everyday life and people are not being patient and kind with themselves and each other at the moment, which is influencing how they behave”. Dr Lim also opined that becoming a better-educated society may have a backfiring effect. “I feel that we have developed a strong sense of self entitlement and a ‘I know better’ attitude as we become a better educated society, be it with regards to whether people should give way to us or act according to what we deem to be the correct behaviour.” BOTTLING ANGER Most of us would dart a couple of dirty looks in the offender’s direction or let go of a “tsk” or two at the most. “By and large, most people will tolerate and forget about the anger, and there are few consequences,” said Dr Lim. However, if you remain angry all the time and do not process the emotion, the consequences are on you. The resulting stress “can lead to insomnia, feelings of anxiety, and physical symptoms such as tension, bruxism and palpitations”, he said. “Anger can also elevate your blood pressure. Studies showed that after an anger outburst, the person’s risk of chest pain, heart attack, dangerous irregular heart rhythm and even stroke is increased for a couple of hours.” It is something to think about before you let the situation get to you. And the damage doesn’t stop there. Bottling up negative emotions such as anger and anxiety can place muscles under constant tension, said Perera. “If this constant tension is not let out or dealt with, it can lead to chronic pain and could lead to the development of mental health conditions.” REACTING TO BAD BEHAVIOUR If we do react, Singaporeans tend to take the passive-aggressive approach. Brushing past the dawdler in front of you instead of asking to pass him or her? Tick. Complaining to your friend about the man who has just cut your queue – within his earshot? Done that. “We are not taught to speak up from young and have generally been brought up to be non-confrontational,” said Dr Lim. “People are also worried about getting into an ugly situation if they spoke up and the other party may retaliate, or that they themselves may get into trouble.” So instead of real-life confrontations, some individuals take to the Internet to shame the other party. “I think Singaporeans are afraid of confrontation for fear of being embarrassed and ridiculed should the situation escalate with the other party. Therefore, naming and shaming online is easier and safer because of anonymity,” said Perera. Furthermore, shaming people on social media replicates what we have been taught to do when we see bad behaviour, added Perera. “It's an attempt to establish boundaries and those boundaries establish the structure and behaviour that we as a society approve and disapprove.” WHAT CAN YOU DO? Since reacting aggressively and bottling up your anger aren’t good options, what can you do? “Instead of aggression or suppression, practise expressing anger in a healthy way through assertive communication techniques to articulate your feelings, needs and desires,” said Professor Megan Hays, a psychologist and assistant professor at The University of Alabama at Birmingham’s Marnix E Heersink School Of Medicine. If need be, step away from the situation, give yourself time to process your emotions, then come back to the situation when your emotions are under control to minimise speaking out of anger, she said on the university’s website . Activities to try during the cool-down period, said Prof Hays, can range from the silly (put on some music and dance/sing the frustration out) to the creative (drawing or painting), productive (do a chore you enjoy) and active (go for a boxing class). Perera said that practising empathy in normal time is another way to help you process the anger. Besides helping you to “regulate your emotions in times of stress”, empathy can also help you to connect with others, she said. It is an opinion echoed by Dr Hans Steiner from Stanford University’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences: “Empathy is one of the great teaching tools in shaping anger and aggression,” he said on the university’s website . “Empathy induction is a healer of anger, fury, rage and feeling at the mercy of overpowering forces. This is true for almost all of us, whether we are children or adults.” BE A ZEN MASTER IN REAL LIFE You can feel your face getting warmer by the second. There’s a pressure building inside your head. If you were a cartoon character, you’d be emitting steam from your nostrils after an aggravating encounter. “You can choose to just feel annoyed transiently or you can always latch on to the anger, and feelings of unfairness and indignant for the rest of the day or even week,” said Dr Lim. It is your choice to make so decide what you think is in your best interest.” How do you choose the Zen path? Here are some common scenarios and what you can do in each to get there. SCENARIO 1: You feel indignant when you see someone not wearing a mask or not wearing it correctly, and getting away with it Perera advised not to engage in angry comments and behaviour “as the person is entitled to his choices and consequences”. But if you feel the need to speak up, do so nicely, said Dr Lim. “You can remind him that it’s for his safety. I have done so many times in public and often in my own practice. People are usually nice about it. They may have been forgetful, careless or simply lazy but when reminded, they will comply.” Of course, there will be always be those who do not want to cooperate. “It is not useful for you to feel indignant. Instead, do your best to protect yourself and be proud of yourself for your civic mindedness,” he advised. SCENARIO 2: A car cuts you off, causing you to slam your brakes It is natural to want to lash out after such an encounter. “You may think that the other party is being dangerous and have endangered your life. This may or may not be true. Sometimes there may be valid reasons why the car had to swerve into your lane,” said Dr Lim. “Even if the driver is driving dangerously, it is not useful to just harp on the issue and spoil your entire day. The worst you can do is to try to seek revenge by chasing the other party and in doing so, drive dangerously and endanger yourself further,” he said. Instead, let the car go, and take in deep breaths to regulate your emotions if you are feeling upset, advised Perera. “Keep a safe distance from the car, or change lane and carry on.” If you feel you have to do something, be useful by making a complaint with the traffic police, especially if you have video footage, said Dr Lim. “This way, you not only seek redress but also ensure the road is safer for others.” SCENARIO 3: Someone fights you for a table, claiming that he was there first This situation may become more common as COVID-19 restrictions get eased and more people choose to eat out. “If it is in you to reason with this person, you can try to do so,” said Dr Lim. “Some may back off when you stand firm.” However, if the other party is unreasonable and you cannot resolve the conflict in a calm manner, getting annoyed or aggressive won’t solve the problem, said Dr Lim. “It is not useful for you nor in your interest to further waste your time or effort. Just look for another seat.” SCENARIO 4: A fellow passenger plays his YouTube video or music at full blast on the bus or MRT As annoyed as you are, play nice, said Perera. “Ask the person nicely if the volume could be toned down.” Doing so civilly can also help educate others about proper etiquette on public transportation, said Dr Lim. If the person refuses, do not engage in aggressive behaviour or comments, said Perera. “Pull out your headphones and listen to your music. Or close your eyes and practise mindful meditation.” Or simple move away, added Dr Lim. SCENARIO 5: Someone cuts your queue and pretends he doesn’t know you were in front of him Tap him on the shoulder and inform him about it as he may be unaware, said Perera. But if the person ignores, let the person pass. “You can also alert the people in charge of the queue cutting,” said Dr Lim. “Everyone in the queue will support you. Generally, when singled out, queue cutters will quietly leave the queue.” Again, if the person is unreasonable or even aggressive, it is not in your interest to pick a fight, advised Dr Lim. SCENARIO 6: Your upstairs neighbour is creating noise (again) Kindness is the word, said Perera. “Check in with the neighbours to first ensure that they are alright and then tell them politely about the noise and seek their understanding,” she said. “Be polite and kind as very often people respond to kindness with kindness.” Dr Lim suggests the nice approach as well. “Should he refuse to improve, you can gather evidence and go to the authority.” Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

This breast cancer awareness month, CNA Women asks: What can we do differently? While some breast cancer patients continue to work while receiving treatment, others take three to 12 months of leave for chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. (Photo: iStock/DragonImages) Faced with an uncertain future, as well as painful and expensive treatments, and mental distress and anguish, breast cancer patients also grapple with disruptions to their career and financial well-being. Some continue to work while receiving treatment, while others choose to take between three and 12 months off work for chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy, noted Dr Samuel Ow, consultant at the Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS) . In fact, some patients may leave their jobs altogether. Globally, between 26 and 53 per cent of cancer survivors lost their job or quit over a 72-month period after diagnosis, noted Hillary Hoo, assistant senior social worker Singapore Cancer Society (SCS) Psychosocial Support Services. Regardless of when they return to work, many breast cancer patients experience some form of stress and anxiety, said Hoo. Their workplace may have changed, their own bodies have changed, and they may not receive the support they need to make a good transition. BACK-TO-WORK CHALLENGES AFTER BREAST CANCER Many people may have some knowledge of the side effects of chemotherapy, which include fatigue, insomnia and poor concentration also known as “chemo fog”. Few however, are aware of the long-lasting residual side effects that linger even after the completion of chemotherapy. In addition to fatigue and poor concentration, these may include numbness in the fingers or toes, as well as mental health issues, said Dr Ow. Stage 2 breast cancer survivor Yeo Ai Lin recalled being caught off guard by these post-chemotherapy side effects, such as joint pain and body aches. For Yeo, the post-chemotherapy side effects were more intense than during the chemotherapy period, making it challenging for the cafe owner to work. “My actions and movement need to be slowed down or readjusted so that I don’t over-exert my body, so it takes a longer time to complete tasks. My hands are also weaker than before, making it more challenging to move goods or furniture. “Instead of making a single trip to replenish the canned beverages in the fridge, this has to be broken down into two to three trips,” she said. Those who aren’t self-employed also worry about whether their boss and co-workers would be sympathetic towards their new limitations and needs. In fact, some may return to work feeling like “damaged goods”, said Hoo. Others struggle with body image issues due to hair loss from chemotherapy, as well as changes to the appearance of their breasts due to mastectomy, reconstruction or radiotherapy. Younger patients may undergo early menopause from the treatment, which may result in physical changes such as dry skin and weight gain as well, noted Dr Ow. In non-inclusive work cultures, breast cancer patients and survivors may even face discrimination. “Some have shared how co-workers distanced themselves because patients were deemed to be 'bad luck' or 'contagious'. They also found themselves the subject of gossip, or were excluded from work opportunities,” Hoo said. In some companies, questionable employment practices include forcing patients to use their annual leave for medical appointments despite still having medical or hospitalisation leave remaining, poor performance appraisals despite having met all work targets, as well as conversion from full-time to part-time or contract work without prior notice, Hoo added. Patients may even face unlawful terminations. A US study suggested that 20 to 30 per cent of breast cancer patients will lose their jobs . “Patients looking for new jobs also worry about whether disclosing their breast cancer diagnosis will negatively impact their chances of getting the job, and many have faced rejections despite already being in remission,” said Hoo. EASING THE TRANSITION BACK TO WORK That said, for many breast cancer patients, work is an essential part of their recovery journey. “Time really passed slowly when I was resting at home. Working helps me to keep my body and mind active and distracts my mind from the pain. It also allows me to meet people and engage in conversations,” said Yeo. In addition to its financial benefits and social support, returning to work also helps to restore a sense of normalcy to patients’ upended lives. While this transition is understandably challenging, Dr Ow suggested that exercise, proper nutrition and keeping a positive outlook will keep side effects more manageable. Cancer rehab, which includes physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietetics, counselling and support groups, also helps. “The side effects may not completely ameliorate with time, but patients can learn to compensate and cope with them over time,” he explained. Patients who need emotional support may also reach out to SCS’s Return To Work Programme, the National University Hospital’s Women’s Emotional Health Service, as well as other support groups. A little planning also goes a long way towards easing the back-to-work transition, especially if patients prep for difficult conversations in advance. Unless the nature of their work requires it, patients should know that they are not required to share their health condition with employers, said Hoo. Should they choose to do so to seek support from their co-workers, they should decide in advance whom they would like to disclose the information to and how much they are willing to share. “Be mindful of the boundaries you would like to put in place surrounding this conversation, be prepared for questions and do not be afraid to communicate when you feel uncomfortable talking about certain topics so that others are aware and can be mindful,” Hoo explained. It would also help if patients make it a point to update employers of their recovery progress, needs and any changed goals or priorities, and inform them about appointment schedules in advance, to minimise work disruptions. In many cases, flexible arrangements can work for both patients and the company. These may include a compressed work week where patients work full-time hours but fewer days per week, staggered hours where patients are given the flexibility to start and end work at a time that better suits their health and work commitments, part-time work, hybrid work, as well as a phased return to work with a reduced workload at first before slowly returning to working at full capacity, Hoo suggested. DEALING WITH INSENSTIVITY AND DISCRIMINATION While not everyone has personal knowledge or experience with breast cancer, and co-workers may sometimes make insensitive remarks, patients have the right to be respected and should make it a point to share their boundaries clearly, constructively and kindly with co-workers, suggested Hoo. When it comes to workplace discrimination, she advised trying to communicate and negotiate with employers as a first step before escalating the matter. In such cases, it also helps for patients to put together evidence surrounding their claims. “If the cancer patient is working in a company where the Singapore branch is a subsidiary, there is also value in reaching out to the main company overseas by writing to management explaining one’s situation with the hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial conclusion,” she said. If this fails, patients may explore lodging a complaint with Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) or the Ministry of Manpower’s Labour Relations and Workplaces Division . “It is free or usually very affordable to file a claim with MOM for wrongful dismissal if one is dismissed due to a medical condition,” said Hoo. SUPPORTING CO-WORKERS WITH BREAST CANCER The onus should not fall squarely on patients and survivors to manage this return-to-work transition. Given that breast cancer is the most common cancer globally, as a society, we should make a collective effort to find out more about the disease and side effects, and be mindful of a co-worker’s or friend’s daily struggles. “We're not just dealing with the cancer diagnosis; we're dealing with a new body image, losing strength on one side, and struggling to build back our confidence and self-esteem,” said Aisha Jiffry, a breast cancer survivor. “Be understanding during this tough period. Be our friend and invite us for lunch. Although many of us may have undergone a transformation, we aren’t aliens, you know?”. Co-workers should also refrain from making negative comments or offering unsolicited and unhelpful advice on how patients could better take care of themselves, said Hoo. “Don’t ask if you can touch our reconstructed breasts, or make comments such as ‘Hey, someone I know also went through it’. Everyone's journey is different so stop comparing us,” Aisha added. With inclusive and supportive work cultures, breast cancer patients may continue to contribute meaningfully as part of a team. “Patients who return to work do have a strong sense of commitment and drive to do well and contribute to their workplace and society, especially if the workplace had been supportive during their cancer journey,” said Hoo.

An expert shares tips on how parents can play a supportive role to help their children work through key challenges. Parents can act as pillars of support for their teenage children. Photos: Shutterstock After failing her Secondary Two exams, Jane* was told that she would be retained at the same level the following year. The 15-year-old was overwhelmed by a deluge of negative emotions – she was disappointed in herself for failing, anxious that her friends would move on and guilt-ridden for letting her parents down. Dr Ong Lue Ping, senior principal clinical psychologist and director of allied health at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), Singapore, recounted how Jane’s parents made a concerted effort to care for her needs, instead of coming down hard on her. “They spent more quality time with the teenager, assured her that they were proud of her and came up with solutions to address her anxieties.” They also discussed with Jane the subjects she needed more support in and worked with her to set realistic academic goals. “After clarifying her parents’ expectations and being more aware of her strengths and abilities, Jane became more confident and developed a healthier self-esteem,” said Dr Ong. “Her mood improved substantially and she went on to be the monitress in her new class.” According to Dr Ong, academic stress, self and parental expectations, peer pressure and personal relationships form the top four stressors faced by teenagers today. Here’s how parents can help their teen work through these challenges, while acting as pillars of support for their emotional health and well-being. STRESSOR 1: ACADEMIC STRESS Having to juggle multiple tasks including homework, project deadlines, weighted assessments and co-curricular activities, it sometimes seems like many teenagers are busier than working adults. To avoid burnout, Dr Ong recommends an 80:20 rule during the school term – 80 per cent of your child’s time should be spent on academic commitments, and 20 per cent on personal pursuits such as gaming and using social media. During the school holidays, this ratio can be reversed. Parents can support their child by discussing academic goals at the start of the first semester. “Try to identify any academic challenges your teen may have early in the year, so that assistance can be sought in a timely manner,” advised Dr Ong. When it comes to leisure, he recommends a balanced approach: “Set appropriate time limits on personal pursuits during the school term but allow teenagers to decide how they want to spend their spare time during the school holidays.” STRESSOR 2: PERSONAL AND PARENTAL EXPECTATIONS To cultivate a healthy attitude towards grades, teenagers need to set realistically achievable expectations, and also learn to be less hard on themselves, said Dr Ong. “Recognise that external factors may sometimes affect your school results, but having the right attitude will help you progress in the long run.” Parents should provide assurance and support, find out what their children are interested in pursuing and help them map achievable milestones and targets. “No matter the results, celebrate their efforts,” said Dr Ong. “After all, every child develops at his or her own pace – some blossom later than others.” STRESSOR 3: PEER PRESSURE Peer pressure from social media and the Internet can exert a powerful influence, shaping the way teens behave. How can parents help their children establish firm boundaries in the face of peer pressure? The answer is open communication, said Dr Ong. “Remind your children that they can talk to you anytime, and that it is okay for them to say no whenever they feel uncomfortable.” Active listening is an important part of open communication, where the parent remains present and shows genuine respect for what their child is saying. “Put away our devices and pause what we are doing to truly listen,” recommended Dr Ong. “In addition, the tonality is important. Use open-ended questions to encourage your teen to share more. Remain as open as you can in the conversation and refrain from making quick judgements.” STRESSOR 4: PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS In adolescence, friendships become more important as teens establish their own identities. This might result in parents and teens beginning to see differences in opinions and life priorities – a frequent trigger for conflict. Dr Ong urged parents to be respectful of their teenager’s need for self-identity while making sure to spend quality time engaging in a common interest or hobby, so as to keep communication channels open. “Use these bonding sessions to model positive behaviours in relationships and invite your teenager to share his or her views, problems and friendships,” he said. “Provide guidance and support, and be sure not to dismiss or minimise the relationship issues they are facing.” WHEN THE STRESSORS BECOME TOO MUCH The adolescent years can be turbulent times and parents need to take note if their child’s behaviour is concerning. For example, feeling moody is common for many teens, but frequent anger or emotional outbursts may be a sign of something more serious. Similarly, feeling down for two weeks or more is a red flag. “It may be a sign of a bigger issue if the day-to-day functioning of your teen is impacted,” said Dr Ong. “For such cases, seeking help early is important.” Advising parents not to hesitate, he added: “Consulting a helping professional such as a counsellor or a psychologist on mental health issues is just like seeing a doctor when we feel physically unwell. With proper rest and intervention, we can recover and feel better. If we ignore the issue and leave it untreated, it may lead to more serious problems.” Learn how to build a positive relationship with your teen and respond in times of mental and emotional distress by visiting Spot The Early Signs . *Not her real name.

    "article_content": "Entertainment Entertainment Singapore Entertainment Trending Women Obsessions Women Wellness Travel Wellness Wellness People People Buyers' Guide People Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Dining Dining People Dining Experiences Travel Travel Travel Wellness Wellness More than 500 million worldwide have osteoarthritis. Experts explain how it affects the body, and why it’s so hard to diagnose. It may start as a twinge in your knee or hip when you get out of bed. Over time, that twinge may turn into persistent pain, swelling or reduced range of motion – signs of a condition called osteoarthritis. But as with many other chronic conditions, doctors are unable to diagnose osteoarthritis until it has already progressed significantly and has interfered with everyday activities. Scientists are racing to find ways to diagnose osteoarthritis earlier and stave off or slow some of the damage from the disease, which affects over 32.5 million adults in the United States and more than 500 million people worldwide. Research has started to show that osteoarthritis is not caused solely by everyday wear and tear on joints, like the deterioration of rubber treads on a tire over time. In some patients, persistent, low-grade inflammation might accelerate the progression of the disease or even cause it. And scientists now believe the damage can start long before symptoms appear. In a new study published last week, researchers from Duke University identified molecules circulating in the blood of women that might serve as markers of the disease up to eight years before an X-ray picked up changes in their bones. “This tells us that there is an osteoarthritis continuum,” said Dr Virginia Byers Kraus, lead author of the study and a professor of medicine at Duke. “You’re already on an escalator that’s leading you up the path to symptoms and X-ray changes way before we thought.” WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BODY IN OSTEOARTHRITIS? The disease affects cartilage, a protective tissue that serves as padding between the bones in your joints, allowing them to glide over each other when you walk, climb stairs or bend to pick up groceries. It is constantly breaking down with exercise and everyday activities. “But our body typically knows how to repair itself,” said Dr Elaine Husni, director of the Cleveland Clinic’s Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Center. The fluid surrounding joints contains enzymes that help cut up and remove worn cartilage, while special cells fix minor damage and rebuild cartilage. But this cycle of breakdown and repair goes awry in people with osteoarthritis, Dr Husni said. In some patients, those enzymes may be too aggressive in removing cartilage, or the healing process may be much slower than the cartilage breakdown. In others, the body senses damage or stress in the joints, which leads to inflammation. This inflammation tells cartilage-snipping enzymes that they need to come remove worn-down tissue. But if the body can’t dial the inflammation back down after repairs are completed, it can lead to more cartilage breakdown, Dr Husni said. Carrying extra body weight is one of the biggest risk factors for developing osteoarthritis. Injuries from sports or repetitive motion also increase the risk of osteoarthritis, as do conditions that involve increased inflammation throughout the body, such as diabetes. Eventually, the cartilage loses its ability to cushion the bones. This leads to pain, a crackling sensation when moving your joints, reduced range of motion and swelling. The symptoms of osteoarthritis are most common in weight-bearing joints like the knee, hip and lower spine, though they may also occur in the small joints in fingers or feet, Dr Husni said. HOW IS OSTEOARTHRITIS DIAGNOSED? When a patient shows up with joint pain, a provider might start by feeling for swelling, testing a joint’s range of motion and ordering tests to rule out other problems or types of arthritis. The current gold standard for diagnosing osteoarthritis is an X-ray, which can show changes in joint structure associated with the disease. The more worn the joint, the narrower the gap appears between bones. However, by the time these changes show up on an X-ray, the damage to the joint is already done, Dr Husni said. X-ray images also don’t always correspond to the severity of symptoms or pain that patients experience. “You could have two patients with the same amount of joint space narrowing – something like two or three millimetres on an X-ray – but one patient could have a ton of pain and the other may not,” Dr Husni said. While Dr Kraus’s team and other researchers are studying biomarkers that might make osteoarthritis easier to diagnose, it may take years to prove a blood test is reliable enough to use in clinical settings. Researchers are also looking at whether these and other molecular markers can be used alongside drugs in trials, to measure whether experimental treatments for osteoarthritis are working or not, she said. For now, patients have to rely on supportive treatments to manage pain, such as heating pads, physical therapy and over-the-counter medicines, Dr Kraus said. And people can use the knowledge that osteoarthritis is a slowly progressing disease to take steps to reduce the risk of disease or slow the inevitable wear and tear of joints, Dr Kraus said: Keeping off excess weight, staying active and following a balanced diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods can help support your joint health and overall well-being.

Here are the basics for staying safe. Young person applying sunscreen. (Photo: iStock/Adennysyahputra) Two new surveys suggest a troubling trend: Young adults seem to be slacking on sun safety . In an online survey of more than 1,000 people published this month by the American Academy of Dermatology , 28 per cent of 18- to 26-year-olds said they didn’t believe suntans caused skin cancer. And 37 per cent said they wore sunscreen only when others nagged them about it. In another poll, published this month by Orlando Health Cancer Institute, 14 per cent of adults under 35 believed the myth that wearing sunscreen every day is more harmful than direct sun exposure. While the surveys are too small to capture the behaviours of all young adults, doctors said they’ve noticed these knowledge gaps and riskier behaviours anecdotally among their younger patients, too. To some extent, experts said, this issue isn’t unique to the current generation of young adults. “There’s a component of young people just being young people,” said Dr Melissa Shive, a dermatologist at UCI Health in Irvine, California. One survey conducted between 1986 and 1996 found that then-18- to 24-year-olds (who are now middle-aged) were more likely than older adults to visit tanning booths and get sunburns. Young adults are often unaware of what sun damage looks like and how best to prevent it, Dr Shive said. She said she recently saw a young patient who didn’t know tan skin and freckles were signs of sun damage. Dr Heather Rogers, a clinical assistant professor of dermatology at the University of Washington, said more of her young patients now report visiting tanning beds. Ultraviolet rays — whether from tanning beds or direct sunlight — can damage skin and cause skin cancer, which can be deadly. Older adults who participated in the recent surveys didn’t have perfect sun safety knowledge, either:17 percent of millennials surveyed by A.A.D. didn’t know tanning caused skin cancer, for instance. But on the whole, younger adults – most of whom fell into Gen Z, meaning they were born after 1997 – were more likely to report believing sun safety myths. Experts said that Gen Z is uniquely susceptible to misinformation about sunscreen and skin cancer that has proliferated on social media platforms like TikTok. They pointed to posts from influencers who claim incorrectly that sunscreen can cause cancer, or from celebrities who claim that they don’t use sunscreen because it interferes with vitamin D absorption. (Years of scientific evidence supports sunscreen’s benefits in preventing skin cancer, Dr Shive said.) “The problem with social media is that nobody’s fact-checking what’s out there,” said Dr Ida Orengo, chair of the dermatology department at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “It can help get information out there about preventing skin cancer, but it can also do the exact opposite and make things worse,” she said. The Orlando Health poll found nearly one-quarter of respondents under 35 believed that staying hydrated prevents sunburn. (There is no evidence that it can do so.) In the AAD survey, more than one-quarter of people ages 18 to 26 believed getting a base tan could prevent skin cancer, even though any tan damages skin cells, Dr Rogers said. HOW SHOULD YOUNG PEOPLE PROTECT THEIR SKIN? Most sun safety recommendations are the same for people of all ages, Dr Shive said. And anyone can get sunburns and skin cancer, so the advice applies regardless of skin color, said Dr Meredithe McNamara, an assistant professor of paediatrics specialising in adolescent medicine at the Yale School of Medicine. 1. Seek out shade If you’ll be in the sun for an extended period, DrRogers recommended an umbrella. Shade is most important between roughly 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when the sun is most intense, DrOrengo said. 2. Wear sun-protective clothing Long sleeves and pants help protect your skin, especially if they’re made of materials with an ultraviolet protection factor, or UPF, rating, DrShive said. Wide-brimmed hats are a good idea, too. 3. Generously apply – and reapply – sunscreen UV rays can damage skin even when it’s cloudy or chilly, so experts recommend wearing sunscreen every day. The ideal sunscreen is at least SPF 30 and is labelled “broad spectrum,” Dr Rogers said. This means it blocks both types of ultraviolet rays, UVA and UVB. Apply sunscreen every morning before leaving the house. If you’re outside, Dr Shive said you should reapply it every two hours, or more often if you’re sweating or swimming. 4. Check your skin Primary care doctors or dermatologists can examine a patient’s skin during annual checkups, Dr McNamara said. But if you spot an unusual mole – one that’s asymmetrical, has an uneven border or unusual color, is larger than a quarter-inch or is changing rapidly – Dr Orengo suggested seeing a dermatologist right away. 5. Think of skin protectino as a retirement fund Dr Clara Curiel-Lewandrowski, a dermatologist at the University of Arizona Cancer Center, offered one Gen Z-specific tip: Approach sun protection like “an investment in your future health.” The more you shield your skin when you’re young, the better protected you’ll be against skin cancer, and against the wrinkles and spots that come from sun exposure later in life.

Should you take them with a pinch of salt, or is there a degree of truth worth looking into? (Photo: iStock/fizkes) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Go on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube or X, and you’ll come across accounts dedicated to preventing blood sugar or glucose spikes, and curbing sugar cravings. Wellness influencers who claim breakfast oats as beneficial for blood sugar levels are as plenty as those who vilify oat milk in your morning coffee. And we haven’t even included posts that celebrate lemon juice or apple cider vinegar as panacea for levelling out glucose spikes. What about those claims that eating your meal in a certain sequence (vegetables and meat first) can help tamper the rapid increase in blood sugar? It’s enough to confuse and make you wonder: Do you have to watch your glucose levels even if you’re not diabetic? IS GLUCOSE THE NEW ENEMY? It is helpful to understand the role and function of glucose – and how it is created and metabolised by your body. The food that you eat gets digested into nutritional components such as sugar (glucose), amino acids and fatty acids, explained Dr Andre Tan, a consultant with Alexandra Hospital’s Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology. In the case of sugar or glucose, it either gets utilised to generate energy for the body or stored for future use. “Insulin is the hormone that helps to shift glucose into the cells of the body for utilisation,” said Dr Tan. “In healthy individuals, there will be an increase in blood glucose levels after a meal but this will be dealt with by the corresponding release of insulin.” So, does that mean blood sugar or glucose increases after eating are normal and to be expected even? It depends on how high the levels are. For non-diabetic individuals, that means no higher than 7.8mmol/L (140mg/dL) 90 minutes after eating, said Wong Hui Mei, Gleneagles Hospital’s principal dietitian, citing the International Diabetes Federation. “While occasional glucose spikes after consuming sugary meals, snacks or drinks are common, it is unlikely for a healthy, non-diabetic person to experience excessive spikes following a typical, balanced meal,” she said. Glucose spikes can also follow after taking certain medications or during severe illness or infection in people who are healthy, said Dr Chan Soo Ling, a consultant with Ng Teng Fong General Hospital’s Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology. SHOULD WE WORRY ABOUT HIGH GLUCOSE LEVELS IF WE DON’T HAVE DIABETES? The short answer is “yes”, especially if the spikes are frequent, said Jaclyn Reutens, a c linical and sports dietitian at Aptima Nutrition and Sports Consultants, as they “might indicate a risk for pre-diabetes or diabetes ”. It begins in your pancreas, the organ responsible for secreting insulin. “Your pancreas will have to work extra hard to release insulin to bring the sugar level down to the desired normal range,” said Dr Chan. This is done by signalling the liver, muscles and fat cells to store the excess glucose to bring down the glucose level circulating in the blood, she explained. However, “in the long run, the production of insulin is affected as the pancreas ‘tires out’ from overworking for years to produce more insulin,” said Dr Tan. “Because of this, glucose cannot properly move into the cells to generate energy or be stored for future use, and rises to a greater extent after meals.” Added Dr Chan, \"with prolonged and repeated sugar spikes, this will lead to the accumulation of excess glucose in the liver and fat cells, especially those around the visceral organs\". \"This will then result in insulin resistance”, which is when “the action of insulin is impaired and is not able to maintain the blood sugar level within the desired normal range”. It’s not only prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes that you have to worry about. “Regular glucose spikes are usually followed by sugar crashes that can cause sudden hunger pangs, cravings, poor sleep, poor concentration and tiredness,” said Reutens. “Over time, these symptoms result in poor food choices that can lead to an increased risk of some cancers, PCOS and infertility, and liver problems.” Wong cautioned that “long-term blood glucose spikes can cause blood vessels to harden and narrow, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke”. SHOULD WE BE MONITORING OUR GLUCOSE LEVELS IF WE’RE NOT DIABETIC? No one looks forward to the low energy level, irritability, maybe even a headache or dizziness that accompany a post-meal sugar crash. And you could be wondering: Should I monitor my blood sugar levels, especially when there's a family history of diabetes? “Closely monitoring one’s own blood glucose levels after a meal is a double-edged sword,” said Dr Tan. The upside is, you may start to seek out the right advice to choose healthier foods or reinforce your resolve to keep to an already-healthy diet. “Additionally, in people with undiagnosed prediabetes or diabetes, it could lead to earlier diagnosis,” he said. However, the downside could be a false sense of complacency, said Dr Tan. If you don’t have diabetes and don’t see a big jump in your blood sugar levels, you may think it is okay to continue eating the way you do. “Another downside could be increased anxiety or an unhealthy obsession with repeatedly checking blood sugar levels when the person is otherwise healthy,” he said. If you have questions about your blood sugar levels, see your doctor for advice and further action. WHICH IS FACT? WHICH IS SOCIAL MEDIA LORE? You would already have read elsewhere that food containing highly processed carbohydrates (such as bubble tea and pork floss bun) break down into simple sugars – and are the culprits for raising blood sugar levels. Conversely, “complex carbohydrates will take longer to be digested and absorbed, so that affects the timing of the rise in glucose levels”, said Dr Tan. Meals that are high in fat and fibre will also “stay in the stomach longer and be digested more slowly, and hence, the rise in blood glucose may be delayed”. But what about the other food or drinks you’ve read about in social media posts? Should you take them with a pinch of salt, or is there a degree of truth worth looking into? We put them to the experts to find out what effect they have on your glucose levels. 1. Drinking lemon juice in water first thing in the morning “The notion about drinking water with lemon juice first thing in the morning to help control sugar level is not scientifically proven,” said Dr Chan. Moreover, drinking such an acidic drink can upset the stomach in some people with sensitive stomachs and aggravate existing acid reflux issues. The highly corrosive drink can also cause possible tooth enamel erosion, she added. But if you don’t have those issues and the lemony flavour stimulates your appetite for breakfast (which you shouldn’t be skipping), said Reutens, there is little harm drinking it. 2. Having oats for breakfast “Oats are low on the glycaemic index (GI) because of their beta-glucan and a warm bowl of oats can certainly start your day off right,” said Reutens. “Just be mindful of the honey, fruits or maple syrup that you add as they will increase your glucose response.” Dr Chan also highlighted that not all oats are the same. “The more processed the oats, the less beneficial fibre they contain. Instant oat has a higher GI than rolled oat and steel-cut oat.” And don’t limit your breakfast options to oats either. “No single food can provide all the nutrients and health benefits required by our bodies,” said Wong. “Managing a healthy and balanced diet with proteins, fats, minimally processed wholegrains and fibre-rich foods, while limiting sugar and refined carbohydrates, can help achieve optimal blood glucose levels.” 3. Eating a savoury breakfast instead of a sweet one While a savoury breakfast can mitigate glucose spikes better than a sweet one, a savoury brekkie can be “high in saturated fat, which can exacerbate insulin resistance”, said Reutens. “Therefore, a savoury breakfast is not superior to a sweet breakfast. Both types of breakfast have their healthier and not-so-healthy choices.” If you’re keen on a savoury start to your day, aim for adequate protein to help promote longer satiety, said Dr Chan. “Eating carbohydrates with protein-rich food tends to help stabilise blood sugars by blunting the absorption of carbohydrates or sugars,” she said. “That being said, your blood sugar levels will still spike if you have a very high-carb diet with protein. It may not spike immediately post-meal (within two hours) but may occur several hours later.” To start you off, opt for low-sugar, high-fibre cereals with milk, omelette with wholemeal toast, thosai with daal or chicken porridge, suggested Reutens. You may want to stay away from curry puff, hotdog bun, char siew pau, nasi lemak, roti prata and fried bee hoon with luncheon meat, she said. 4. Mixing apple cider vinegar in water and drinking it a few minutes before a meal “Studies of apple cider vinegar’s impact on blood sugar levels tend to be small and have mixed results,” said Dr Chan. “There is little scientific evidence to support its benefits. Human studies supporting the daily use of apple cider vinegar are lacking. The efficacy and safety in long term use is also unknown.” Reutens also noted that “no good research” suggests that apple cider vinegar helps to lower blood glucose levels. “The amount of carbohydrates and macronutrients such as protein, fat and fibre have a bigger impact on glucose control.” But if you’re keen to continue with diluted apple cider vinegar because the drink encourages you to eat a more balanced meal, “there is no harm in doing so”, said Reutens. One to two tablespoons in water “is probably safe” but like lemon water, the acidity may lead to stomach irritation or indigestion, nausea and tooth enamel erosion, cautioned Dr Chan. “To minimise the risk of tooth enamel erosion, sip diluted apple vinegar cider through a straw and rinse your mouth with water afterwards,” she advised. 5. Using oat milk for your coffee Here’s where it gets confusing. While oats for breakfast can be beneficial, the same can’t be said of oat milk . Why is that? To make oat milk, enzymes are added to oats to break down the starch into a simple sugar called maltose. Maltose has a GI of about 105, which is even higher than pure glucose. This is why even without the addition of sugar, unsweetened oat milk may not be suitable for those looking to prevent blood sugar spikes. And that’s not taking into account the sugar added to make such plant-based milks more palatable, said Dr Chan. When in doubt, check the ingredient list and nutrition panel on the packaging, advised Reutens. 6. Eating carbohydrates last Doesn’t everything get digested into a mush in the stomach? There may be merit eating your rice or noodles last , said Dr Chan. “Protein, fat and fibre can slow gastric emptying rate. If your stomach retains and processes its contents longer before they enter the intestine for the nutrients to be absorbed, it will help reduce spikes in blood sugar after a meal,” she said. Dr Chan cited a study that found eating vegetables or protein before carbohydrates as opposed to the other way around created a glucose level that was consistently lower by about 17 per cent to 30 per cent for up to 120 minutes. This means eating your vegetables, then your chicken or fish, followed by your rice or noodles, said Reutens. And “you should eat dessert straight after a meal, so that the main meal can mitigate the impact of the blood glucose spikes caused by your dessert”. 7. Choosing \"less\" bad alcoholic drinks It may have ginseng or kombucha but unfortunately, alcoholic drinks such as cocktails “have little or no nutritional value and often contain a lot of added sugar”, said Wong. “Added sugar is empty in calories and may increase the risk of blood glucose spikes.” If you must imbibe, Wong has two key principles to follow: First, choose an alcohol that is free or low in carbohydrates and sugar. This could be any distilled spirit such as rum, vodka, gin, tequila, whiskey or brandy. Then, opt for healthier mixers such as diet soda, seltzer water and diet tonic water instead of high-sugar juice, syrup and regular soda. Second, drink in moderation and avoid drinking regularly. “The recommendation is one drink or one unit per day for women, and two drinks or two units per day for men,” said Wong. One unit of alcohol is defined as 100ml of wine, 30ml of spirits (about 1 shot glass) or 330ml of beer. Copyright© Mediacorp 2024. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

Experts explain how common it is, as well as the causes and treatments available. (Photo: iStock/Korrawin) This audio is generated by an AI tool. When it comes to persistent pain in men, it’s never a good sign, especially when it concerns the testicles. Case in point: Testicular torsion. The name of the condition may ring a bell for you if you’ve recently read about the teenager who lost a testicle as a result of misdiagnosis and delayed treatment for the issue. The young patient had initially seen a doctor for “pain in his left abdomen that had started from his left testis” and “increased bowel movement with watery stools”. He was misdiagnosed with stomach-related issues and prescribed antibiotics for the pain and inflammation in his scrotum. However, the boy's condition worsened despite repeated visits to the same doctor. Eventually, he had to undergo surgery to remove the affected testicle. What exactly is testicular torsion and could it happen to you? Here’s what the urologists say: WHAT IS TESTICULAR TORSION? Each testis or testicle is connected to the spermatic cord, a cord-like structure that contains blood and lymph vessels, nerves and the vas deferens, a coiled tube that carries sperm out of the testis to the penis during ejaculation. Testicular torsion occurs when the testicle rotates in the scrotum and twists the spermatic cord, cutting off the blood supply to and from the affected testicle, according to Dr Edwin Jonathan Aslim, a consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Urology. \"This can result in infarction (tissue death due to inadequate blood supply) of the affected testis if the arterial blood supply is not restored,\" said Dr Lim Yong Wei, a consultant from Department of Urology, Sengkang General Hospital. The repercussions aren’t pleasant. There'll be a sudden onset of pain over a few hours, said Dr Lim, and this is pain that is \"out of proportion to any injury suffered by the individual\". However, there is usually no sign of fever and urinary problem, he said. The affected testicle may also be higher than the other one and lie horizontally in the swollen scrotum, according to Dr Chong Weiliang, a consultant with National University Hospital’s Department of Urology. Other symptoms may include nausea and vomiting. HOW COMMON IS IT AND ARE YOU LIKELY TO DEVELOP THE CONDITION? Testicular torsion can occur at any age, said Dr Aslim, but is most commonly seen in two age groups: During infancy and between 12 and 18 years old. “In adults, we occasionally see these cases in young men presenting to the emergency department, perhaps fewer than five per year,” said Dr Aslim. While there hasn’t been any local data on testicular torsion cases, the incidence rate could run between 3.5 and 15 per 100,000 males below the age of 25, said Dr Aslim, citing studies done in Asian countries such as South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. Dr Lim's department has attended to close to 20 cases of testicular torsion in the last two years. \"Five of these cases required the removal of the affected testis,\" he said. According to him, testicular torsion usually affects one testis at a time and it's often the left testicle, he said, citing a 1998 paper on 670 patients in the UK. Dr Chong also mentioned that cases are “relatively uncommon” and sees an estimated one or two cases a month. “From historical data, patients with such a predisposition would have mostly presented by the age of 25, though outliers can present later. “One big factor,\" he continued, \"which predisposes patients to testicular torsion is the laxity of the attachments between the testis and the surrounding scrotal walls.\" This allows the testis to move more than usual.” According to him, the laxity can affect both testes. This laxity is likely owing to Bell-Clapper deformity, “a developmental anomaly affecting the tissue layers enveloping or wrapping the testes”, explained Dr Aslim. As a result, the testes are “not properly anchored in place, making them prone to loosely twist and turn within the scrotum”. “Bell-Clapper deformity often affects both testicles, with rates as high as 100 per cent in some studies,” said Dr Aslim, adding that the condition tends to run in the family. DO UNDERWEAR CHOICE AND SPORTS INJURIES INCREASE THE RISK OF TESTICULAR TORSION? Maybe not underwear choice. \" There is currently no evidence in medical literature to recommend a choice of underwear between boxers and briefs,\" said Dr Lim. \"We are still not clear on the exact mechanism that causes testicular torsion. We understand that it occurs spontaneously.\" But \"physical trauma can occasionally be a trigger”, said Dr Aslim. “Therefore, contact sports may, in theory, trigger (testicular torsion) if there is a blow or trauma to the scrotum or testis.” It doesn't hurt to get some protection down there when playing football, guys. CAN YOU MASSAGE THE SCROTUM TO UNTWIST THE TESTICLE? “Massaging the scrotum is not recommended as it’s unlikely to untwist the spermatic cord and may even worsen the twisting,” said Dr Chong. Furthermore, the patient will be in too much pain to withstand any form of massage, said Dr Aslim. Massage is also not recommended if it results in delay to seek medical help, he said. IS SURGERY THE ONLY FORM OF TREATMENT AVAILABLE? Testicular torsion is an emergency and immediate surgical intervention is required to salvage the affected testicle, said Dr Chong. During the procedure, the testicle is untwisted to restore blood flow, then stitched in place to prevent it from twisting again. Doctors typically also anchor the other unaffected testicle, he said. Interestingly, in some cases, the twisting may spontaneously undo itself and end the pain and other symptoms, according to Dr Aslim. While this may spell good news for the patient, it’s not so much for the doctor as it is challenging to diagnose the condition without “symptoms and/or abnormal findings”. At times, the testicular torsion may recur and surgery may still be needed. However, you shouldn’t put up with the pain and wait for the off chance that the testicle may untwist itself. Time is of the essence as the longer the torsion is allowed to manifest, the more damage the testicle accumulates, highlighted Dr Aslim. For comparison, the success rate of salvaging the testicle is 84 per cent to 100 per cent when operated within six hours from the start of the symptoms, said Dr Lim; this rate drops to 50 per cent if the symptoms started six to 12 hours ago. It drops to a dismal 4 per cent if the patient was operated on 12 to 24 hours later, he said. “If the torsion has been present for too long and the testicle is unsalvageable, an orchidectomy will be performed,” said Dr Chong, to surgically remove the testicle. HOW WOULD LOSING A TESTICLE AFFECT FERTILITY? It wouldn’t, said Dr Chong, if the other testicle is healthy. “However, it can reduce the overall hormonal production and semen quality due to the reduced production of sperms.” Added Dr Aslim: “In cases where the other testicle is abnormal or lost, then losing a testicle may lead to infertility and problems with male physical development”. Other issues may include psychological distress from the loss of a sex organ, noted Dr Chong. “Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider are essential to monitor hormonal levels and the affected testicular size after testicular torsion,” he said.

Young woman using her phone to read up on medical information. (Photo: iStock/Doucefleur) Do you have a headache or is it a sinus infection? What does a stress fracture feel like? Should you be worried about the pain in your chest? If you Google those questions now, the answers may be written by artificial intelligence. This month, Google rolled out a new feature called AI Overviews that uses generative AI, a type of machine-learning technology that is trained on information from across the Internet and produces conversational answers to some search questions in a matter of seconds. In the weeks since the tool launched, users have encountered a wide array of inaccuracies and odd answers on a range of subjects. But when it comes to how it answers health questions, experts said the stakes were particularly high. The technology could point people toward healthier habits or needed medical care, but it also has the potential to give inaccurate information. The AI can sometimes fabricate facts. And if its answers are shaped by websites that aren’t grounded in science, it might offer advice that goes against medical guidance or poses a risk to a person’s health. The system has already been shown to produce bad answers seemingly based on flawed sources. When asked “how many rocks should I eat,” for example, AI Overviews told some users to eat at least one rock a day for vitamins and minerals. (The advice was scraped from The Onion , a satirical site.) “You can’t trust everything you read,” said Dr Karandeep Singh, chief health AI officer at UC San Diego Health. In health, he said, the source of your information is essential. Hema Budaraju, a Google senior director of product management who helps to lead work on AI Overview, said that health searches had “additional guardrails,” but declined to describe those in detail. Searches that are deemed dangerous or explicit, or that indicate that someone is in a vulnerable situation, such as with self-harm, do not trigger AI summaries, she said. Google declined to provide a detailed list of websites that support the information in AI Overviews, but said that the tool worked in conjunction with the Google Knowledge Graph , an existing information system that has pulled billions of facts from hundreds of sources. The new search responses do specify some sources; for health questions, these are often websites like the Mayo Clinic, WebMD, the World Health Organization and the scientific research hub PubMed. But it isn’t an exhaustive list: The tool can also pull from Wikipedia, blog posts, Reddit and e-commerce websites. And it doesn’t tell users which facts came from which sources. With a standard search result, many users would be able to distinguish immediately between a reputable medical website and a candy company. But a single block of text that combines information from multiple sources might cause confusion. “And that’s if people are even looking at the source,” said Dr Seema Yasmin, the director of the Stanford Health Communication Initiative, adding, “I don’t know if people are looking, or if we’ve really taught them adequately to look.” She said her own research on misinformation had made her pessimistic about the average user’s interest in looking beyond a quick answer. As for the accuracy of the chocolate answer, Dr Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Tufts University, said that it had some facts mostly correct and that it summarised research into chocolate’s health benefits. But it does not distinguish between strong evidence provided by randomised trials and weaker evidence from observational studies, he said, or provide any caveats on the evidence. It’s true that chocolate contains antioxidants, Dr Mozaffarian said. But the claim that chocolate consumption could help prevent memory loss? That hasn’t been clearly proved, and “needs a lot of caveats,” he said. Having such claims listed next to one another gives the impression that some are better established than they really are. The answers can also change as the AI itself evolves, even when the science behind a given answer hasn’t changed. A Google spokesperson said in a statement that the company worked to show disclaimers on responses where they were needed, including notes that the information that shouldn’t be treated as medical advice. It’s not clear how, exactly, AI Overviews evaluate the strength of evidence, or whether it takes into account contradictory research findings, like those on whether coffee is good for you . “Science isn’t a bunch of static facts,” Dr Yasmin said. She and other experts also questioned whether the tool would draw on older scientific findings that have since been disproved or don’t capture the latest understanding of an issue. “Being able to make a critical decision – to discriminate between quality of sources – that’s what humans do all the time, what clinicians do,” said Dr Danielle Bitterman, a physician-scientist in artificial intelligence at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “They are parsing the evidence.” If we want tools like AI Overviews to play that role, she said, “we need to better understand how they would navigate across different sources and how they apply a critical lens to arrive at a summary,” she said. Those unknowns are concerning, experts said, given that the new system elevates the AI Overview response over individual links to reputable medical websites such as those for the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic. Such sites have historically risen to the top of the results for many health searches. A Google spokesperson said that AI Overviews will match or summarise the information that appears in the top results of searches, but isn’t designed to replace that content. Rather, the spokesperson said, it’s designed to help people get a sense of the information available. The Mayo Clinic declined to comment on the new responses. A representative from the Cleveland Clinic said that people seeking health information should “directly search known and trusted sources” and reach out to a health care provider if they’re experiencing any symptoms. A representative from Scripps Health, a California-based health care system cited in some AI Overview summaries, said in a statement that “citations in Google’s AI generated responses could be helpful in that they establish Scripps Health as a reputable source of health information.” However, the representative added, “we do have concerns that we cannot vouch for the content produced through AI in the same way we can for our own content, which is vetted by our medical professionals.” For medical questions, it’s not just the accuracy of an answer that matters, but how it’s presented to users, experts said. Take the question “Am I having a heart attack?” The AI response had a useful synopsis of symptoms, said Dr Richard Gumina, the director of cardiovascular medicine at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. But, he added, he had to read past a long list of symptoms before the text advised him to call 911. Dr Gumina also searched “Am I having a stroke?” to see whether the tool might produce a more urgent response – which it did, telling users in the first line to call 911. He said he would immediately advise patients experiencing symptoms of a heart attack or a stroke to call for help. Experts encouraged people looking for health information to approach the new responses with caution. Essentially, they said, users should take note of the fine print under some AI Overviews answers: “This is for informational purposes only. For medical advice or diagnosis, consult a professional. Generative AI is experimental.” By Talya Minsberg © The New York Times Company The article originally appeared in The New York Times . Copyright© Mediacorp 2024. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

(Art: The New York Times/Keith Negley) Take a moment to imagine a small grey rock sitting in the palm of your hand. It’s silent, smooth and otherwise unremarkable. Are you bored yet? If so, that’s kind of the point. Most people will eventually lose interest in a dull piece of granite. So there’s a theory percolating online that if you adopt the qualities of a stone, becoming impassive and bland, then you will repel the argumentative, antagonistic people in your life who are itching for conflict. It’s called the “grey rock” method, and over the last decade it has spread on social media, including among TikTok influencers, who have shared strategies to channel your inner rock. It even surfaced on a recent episode of the reality show Vanderpump Rules, when a cast member, Ariana Madix, said that using the technique had helped her avoid toxic interactions with her ex-boyfriend, Tom Sandoval, who had been unfaithful. The goal of the grey rock technique is to disengage without ending contact, said Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist and the author of It’s Not You: Identifying And Healing From Narcissistic People. People who grey rock remain neutral, keep their interactions “trim and slim,” and avoid sharing information that could potentially be turned against them, she added. But while some psychologists say that the method is helpful under certain circumstances, it isn’t always the right solution. HOW DOES \"GREY ROCKING\" WORK? There isn’t an official set of rules for grey rocking. The method has not been studied, nor is it derived from an evidence-based psychological practice. But, in general, you can think of grey rocking as a form of emotional disengagement, Dr Durvasula said. Antagonistic people are usually looking for a fight, she added, and grey rocking can be one way to keep the peace and avoid “getting into the mud with them.” It is especially effective in written communication, like texting, as a way of avoiding long, meandering messages, she said. The strategy can also be useful at work, she added, where concise communication is often valued. Many variations on grey rocking exist. One communication coach on TikTok demonstrated various ways to avoid being “overly icy or awkward,” a process she calls “soft grey rocking.” For example, she said, if someone asks you how a job search is going, instead of explaining how hard it has been you can talk about the different networking events you’ve attended. Sometimes, despite your best efforts, conversations can become heated. If the person with whom you’re interacting remains disrespectful, dishonest or manipulative, then you may be better off severing contact, Dr Durvasula said. But not everybody can do that immediately, especially if the relationship involves a close family member or a spouse. Tina Swithin, the founder of One Mom’s Battle, a website and online community for people who are divorcing someone with narcissistic tendencies, recommends the “yellow rock” technique, particularly when coparenting. Unlike the grey rock, which is “cool to the touch and a bit aloof,” the yellow rock “has an air of friendliness,” she wrote in her guide for parents navigating the family court system. According to Swithin, a person using the yellow rock technique might say: “While I do not agree with you, you have every right to feel the way you do.” Or: “I’m hoping we can both take time away from this topic to regroup as we are not going in a positive or productive direction. Let’s revisit this next week.” WHERE DID THE CONCEPT COME FROM? While Dr Durvasula counsels clients in her private practice on how best to use the technique – and has even given away grey rocks as gifts during book signings – she didn’t learn about the method in school. Rather, grey rocking seems to have been created outside the realm of psychology. To her best recollection, Dr Durvasula had stumbled upon the terminology online, more than a decade ago, she said. One of the earliest references appears on the website Love Fraud, which is run by Donna Andersen. Andersen said she created Love Fraud in 2005 to warn others about con artists and psychopaths after she said her then-husband had stolen a quarter-million dollars and had numerous affairs. In 2012, one member of her online community, who chose to remain anonymous, wrote an essay titled The Grey Rock Method Of Dealing With Psychopaths. If breaking contact is impossible, the essay advised, one escape strategy is to give dull, monotonous responses during a conversation. “Psychopaths are addicted to drama, and they can’t stand to be bored,” the writer continued. WHEN SHOULD YOU TRY TO GREY ROCK? Lara Fielding, a behavioural psychologist in St Helena, California, and the author of Mastering Adulthood, cautioned against using grey rocking for long periods of time. “I would call this a distress tolerance technique,” she said, best reserved for when you’re in crisis mode. Sometimes, she added, you “do what you need to do to not make the situation worse.” But, over time, grey rocking can become ineffective, she added, “because you are cutting yourself off from your authentic feelings – essentially denying your own needs.” If you decide to do it, she said, ask yourself three questions: First, is it effective? Second, how long can I do this before it harms me? And third, am I working to solve the problem if I have to do this very often? In some cases, the person you’re grey rocking might become aggravated that you aren’t speaking to them as you normally would, leading to more tension, Dr Durvasula said. If you want to maintain this relationship, the VAR method , which stands for Validate, Assert and Reinforce, can potentially help establish boundaries and de-escalate the situation. Dr Fielding offered these examples: Validate: “I see that this is upsetting you.” Assert: “At the same time, this discussion is stressing me out a bit. So could we take a break and come back to it?” Reinforce: “If we can take a little break or if you could bring your voice down a bit, I will be able to hear you better.” By Christina Caron © The New York Times Company The article originally appeared in The New York Times .

While it doesn’t have a cure, one of the key ways to manage it is through diet and exercise. One common symptom of polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, is irregular periods. (Photo: iStock/Jacob Wackerhausen) This audio is generated by an AI tool. When Nur (who only wanted to use her first name) started menstruating at 10 years old, she didn’t realise that irregular periods were not normal. She would bleed, sometimes for 15 days, sometimes 22 days, and even, 25 days. There would also be two- or three-month stretches where she wouldn’t have a period at all. The irregularity appeared strange to her – her peers menstruated monthly and for around a week only – but she dismissed her worries. Then, when she was 21, she experienced her longest interval without a period: Eight months. “Eight months was so long … and I felt like my body was so tired,” the 27-year-old educator told CNA Women. “I knew I had to get myself checked.” She visited a gynaecologist and within a week, learnt that she had polycystic ovary syndrome, also known as PCOS. Nur, who had never heard of the gynaecological condition before, was shocked. “It was a lot to take in at 21,” Nur said. “I wish I had known more about the condition and how common it was so I wouldn’t be so afraid.” PCOS: WHAT IT IS AND WHAT CAUSES IT According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated eight to 13 per cent of women of reproductive age are affected by PCOS. PCOS is a hormonal condition that affects a woman’s period and fertility , as well as aspects of her appearance, said Dr Anupriya Agarwal, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. The “polycystic” in PCOS comes from the many small cysts (fluid-filled sacs) that develop in the ovaries, Dr Agarwal said. Dr Veronique Viardot-Foucault, director and senior consultant of clinical endocrinology at the department of reproductive medicine at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH), said PCOS is “multi-factorial and complex” with an unclear exact cause. It often runs in families, suggesting a genetic component. PCOS is also often linked to lifestyle factors such as lack of exercise and overeating, Dr Viardot-Foucault said. She explained that PCOS makes it more difficult for the body to use the hormone insulin, which converts sugars and starches from food into energy. Known as insulin resistance, this can lead to higher insulin levels in the body as glucose builds up in the bloodstream. High insulin levels can lead to an increase in male hormones called androgens, Dr Agarwal added, which causes a hormonal imbalance in the woman’s body. PCOS: SIGNS, SYMPTOMS AND RISKS Dr Agarwal said PCOS usually begins in adolescence but can start at any time during a woman’s reproductive years. Common symptoms of PCOS point to the effects of hormonal imbalance and insulin resistance, such as: While Nur said she had almost all of these symptoms, some women with PCOS may not experience obvious symptoms. To diagnose PCOS, a gynaecologist will take a detailed medical history and conduct a physical examination, do blood tests, or an ultrasound of the pelvis, said Dr Viardot-Foucault. She added that a woman will be diagnosed with PCOS if she has at least two of three findings: Dr Viardot-Foucault said women with PCOS tend to have an increased risk of developing certain medical issues later in life, such as diabetes , high blood pressure , uterine cancer , snoring and daytime fatigue, severe mood changes, and disorders such as depression. Both Dr Agarwal and Dr Viardot-Foucault highly encourage women who exhibit PCOS symptoms to get an earlier diagnosis as it can help with their long-term health and prevent complications. MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT OF PCOS There is no cure for PCOS but the disease can be managed. Dr Viardot-Foucault said the aim is to reduce symptoms, address fertility challenges, and prevent or treat related long-term complications. She noted that good control of symptoms can be achieved through lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medical treatment. Diet and exercise are key as they can reduce the harmful effects of symptoms. A good diet includes high-fibre vegetables like broccoli, lean protein like fish, and anti-inflammatory foods like turmeric and tomatoes. When it comes to exercise, WHO suggests 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity each week, ideally spread across several sessions. “PCOS made me feel more conscious about my health,” Nur said. “I exercise a lot, I take care of what I eat, and I feel more loving towards my body – despite the challenges.” Dr Viardot-Foucault noted that studies have shown that losing five to 10 per cent of body weight can restore ovulation, regulate the menstrual cycle, improve the chances of pregnancy, and lower the long-term risks of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases . In addition to lifestyle changes, medical treatment can help address irregular periods, fertility problems, excess hair growth, and weight issues. These include oral contraceptive pills containing progesterone to keep the uterine lining healthy for regular periods, insulin-sensitising medicine to lower glucose levels, and ovulation-inducing drugs such as gonadotropin for those trying to get pregnant. Women with PCOS can also explore treatments for excess hair growth, or counselling to help manage their mood swings and depression. LIVING WITH PCOS Nur is getting married soon and told CNA Women that having PCOS pushed her to confront the potential struggles of starting a family with her partner. “After I was diagnosed, I started to really reflect on the idea of having children,” she said. “It may be a struggle, but I’m grateful to have a supportive and understanding partner.” “My mum and some of my other female relatives struggled with conceiving and irregular periods too – even if they don’t openly talk about it and I’m not sure if they were formally diagnosed with PCOS. “I hope people know that having a gynaecological condition isn’t the end – a lot of women live with it,” Nur added. “With more information, women can make the best decisions to manage their health in the best way they can.” CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

Does lo-fi music really help you concentrate and study better? (Photo: iStock/yipengge) This audio is generated by an AI tool. The sound of raindrops gently tapping against the window may be audio salve for some individuals. For others, it could be the lo-fi playlist on Spotify that helps them to block out distractions. Yet others may enjoy the ASMR tingles from triggers such as ear brushing, whispering and gentle tapping. Suffice it to say, different people find different sounds pleasurable – and sometimes, the very same noises may elicit different responses from you in different situations. For instance, one man’s chewing could be another’s misophonia (that is, you get triggered by certain sounds). You could be glaring at the person making smacking noises next to you in the food court; but at home, you find it entertaining – relaxing even – to watch mukbang videos in all their biting, chomping and slurping glory. It begs the question: What makes certain sounds an audio spa to your ears and not nails on a chalkboard? More intriguingly, can you harness the power of sounds to help you focus better, fall asleep faster or learn better? Here’s a look. FIRST, THE BRAIN According to Dr John Shepherd Lim, the chief wellbeing officer of Singapore Counselling Centre, a few areas of the brain are activated when we engage in mental tasks such as reading, writing and analysing data. For instance, “the prefrontal cortex is heavily involved, particularly for decision making and attention”, he said. Meanwhile, “the parietal lobes process sensory information, and handle numerical and mathematical processing”, said Dr Annabelle Chow, the principal clinical psychologist at Annabelle Psychology. The hippocampus is another important part as it provides “essential memory formation and retrieval”, she said. What’s the point in knowing these various parts of your brain? “ Sound can impact these areas by either enhancing or distracting focus, depending on its nature,” said Dr Lim. Think about the times when soothing music helped you to concentrate on a report versus loud and unpredictable sounds disrupting your focus. And it’s not because Mozart or Enya wields certain sorcery over us. The hippocampus, one of the first regions of the brain to be ravaged by Alzheimer’s disease, is found to benefit from music , which “may increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus, allowing production of new neurons and improving memory” . Studies also suggest that noise-induced stress may decrease dopamine availability in the prefrontal cortex. This results in decreased higher brain function and impaired learning and memory. YOUR BUILT-IN NOISE CANCELLATION FUNCTION If you’re wondering why you can ignore certain sounds in your office (the photocopier printing, general chatter, keyboards clacking etc) but not someone erratically tapping his pen next to you, that’s because the type of sound you hear can shift your brain’s focus, said Dr Chow. Most of the time, your brain is in “selective attention” mode, which helps it to filter out unimportant sounds and lets you continue with your task, she said. “When we receive sound signals that are not relevant to our current focus, our brain detects them because they might be important or unexpected. “If our brain decides the sound is important, our prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe shift our attention to the sound involuntarily,” said Dr Chow. In a way, it’s like deactivating your brain’s built-in noise cancellation function. “However, this process of hearing, deciding and filtering adds to the brain’s cognitive load, reducing our working memory capacity and impairing task performance,” said Dr Chow. Sound can also make it harder to focus as it competes for your attention, she said. How you’re feeling that day plays a part as well. “Our emotions toward sounds can be influenced by factors such as our control of attention — how we manage and inhibit impulses — and our emotional states,” said Dr Chow. “For instance, we might feel more irritated by laughter and talking when we are angry, and desire peace and quiet.” Generally, volume, pitch and rhythm play a role in how your brain reacts, said Dr Lim. “For instance, high-pitched or loud noises might be irritating to some, while rhythmic or predictable sounds can help others concentrate by providing a steady auditory background.” Still, the reactions can vary from person to person “due to individual differences in auditory processing and personal preferences”, he said. There are also those who require complete silence to work or study. “ This need for silence may be due to heightened sensitivity to auditory stimuli, or a brain that is less adept at filtering out background noise,” said Dr Lim. WHY YOU WORK BETTER OR FALL ASLEEP IN FRONT OF THE TV White noise refers to any sound (it can be static or forest sounds) that “contains all frequencies across the spectrum of audible sound in equal measure” . Some people like white noise because it can minimise the disturbance caused by unexpected noises for them. But does white noise really work? “Our current understanding of the impact of white noise, nature sounds and similar auditory stimuli on the brain is incomplete,” said Dr Chow. “Research suggests that white noise is likely to have little general effect on cognitive functions in neurotypical individuals, while nature sounds are associated with reduced stress levels and improved cognitive performance at certain tasks.” And it doesn’t have to be a specific white noise playlist either. Ever found yourself falling asleep or working better with the TV on? The background noise provided by the TV can be relaxing or sleep-inducing , said Dr Vikas Jain, a clinical assistant professor of sleep medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine, especially when it’s your favourite movie or TV show that may reduce the anxiety keeping you awake at night, he said. If you’re working from home, background TV can “serve multiple purposes”, according to Dr Lim. “They can distract you from unpleasant thoughts, provide a comforting auditory presence, and enhance learning through auditory cues. “These effects are grounded in how the brain processes sensory input and regulates emotions,” he added. “The brain’s limbic system, which governs emotions, can be influenced by auditory stimuli; pleasant sounds can help regulate mood by reducing cortisol levels and increasing serotonin.” On the flip side, there is also research that suggests having the TV on while you work may not be a good idea. In a study on 90 college students tasked to read the newspaper, those who did so with the TV on in the background recalled less than the ones who read in silence. The moral of the story? You do what works for you. Before you go download White Noise 10 Hours from Spotify, figure out what sounds calm you first. “We know that individuals have differences in sensory processing and varying sensitivity levels to different sounds,” said Dr Chow. “Some people might find the pitter-patter of rain soothing due to its stable and consistent nature, while others with sensitivity to repetition may find it overwhelming. “An individual might associate forest sounds with peace and comfort, helping them feel calm and focused,” continued Dr Chow, “while that same individual might associate the sound of the ocean with a near-death experience, making it unsettling and fear inducing. These positive and negative associations stem from our lived experiences.” WHAT WORKS BEST FOR WORK, LEARNING AND SLEEP THEN? On the whole, sounds that provide a good soundscape for work and sleep are “ typically consistent, low in volume, and free from sudden changes, like soft instrumental music”, said Dr Lim. “Elements such as language, beats per minute, volume and recording quality can all influence the brain’s response. Lo-fi music, for example, often includes ambient sounds like raindrops or soft taps, which can create a comforting and familiar auditory environment conducive to both work and relaxation.” Sounds that have “low variability in tone and articulation”, and can be played on loop or are predictable are “generally the least arousing and perhaps more appropriate as background music”, said Dr Chow. “It might help us feel secure because we can subconsciously predict what sound comes next.” If you’re reading or writing, it might be best to avoid music with lyrics, said Dr Chow. “L istening to music with lyrics activates the parts of the brain that deals with auditory information. If we’re attempting to concentrate on a task that involves words, it can be taxing for our brains to do both flawlessly.” For that matter, you might not be able to concentrate on reading a report if you have a K-drama on TV. Sometimes, learning may yield better results if the material is presented in an audio format, said Dr Chow. “Some individuals may have better developed auditory processing skills and are thus, better able to comprehend and retain information presented in an auditory format.” For example, if you’re able to focus and retain the information better by listening to an audio recording than reading the book, you are better able to comprehend the material and learn, she said. “Some materials are better taught with auditory cues. For example, it may be easier to understand the tone and emphasis of words when learning a new language through audio than text.” For sleep and relaxation, Dr Chow suggested slower music based on what studies have found. “Slower music synchronises with our parasympathetic nervous system through a process called entrainment, where the body aligns with the environment's rhythm. “Essentially, the brain recognises that it does not need to be in fight-or-flight mode because the sounds remain consistent. Focusing on these sounds helps distract us from anxious thoughts or other noises that might keep us awake. These sounds help decrease stress by regulating stress hormones like cortisol,” she said.

Here’s what to know about treatment and prevention. (Art: The New York Times/Eiko Ojala) It’s a day no man looks forward to: Looking in the mirror and admitting that his widow’s peak is real. Or feeling the breeze on the crown of his head. Up to half of men will experience some form of male-pattern baldness by 50, and still more after that. Though our genetics and hormones play major roles in hair loss, the exact mechanisms aren’t fully understood, which is why treatments to stem and reverse it remain imperfect, said Dr Arash Mostaghimi, vice chair of clinical trials and innovation in the dermatology department at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. However, there are a few things you can do both before and after that fateful day comes. Here is what you need to know about what works, what’s new and what to avoid. WHAT CAUSES MALE PATTERN BALDNESS The average human head contains around 100,000 hairs. Each is connected to a follicle, which can hold one to five hairs. “It’s basically its own organ,” Dr Mostaghimi said of a scalp follicle. “It has its own stem cells. It regenerates.” Typically, men’s hair loss occurs because of an increase in an enzyme in the scalp that converts testosterone to a more potent form, called dihydrotestosterone (or DHT), Dr Mostaghimi said. The reasons that one man might have more DHT than another are not well understood, but it has a genetic component. When men have too much DHT in their scalp, the hormone initiates a complex process that leads to hair miniaturisation, in which hairs and follicles begins to shrink. (This is why men frequently have finer hair or even peach fuzz where they are balding.) This hair loss occurs in a predictable sequence: First around the temples, then at the crown of the head, where increased levels and activity of the offending enzyme and its modified testosterone are found, Dr Mostaghimi said. Hence the phrase “male-pattern baldness.” HOW TO TREAT (AND PREVENT) HAIR LOSS If you’re worried about hair loss, the first step is to make an appointment with a dermatologist. Dermatology is a big specialty; find a doctor who’s passionate about hair loss, said Dr Danilo C Del Campo, a dermatologist in Chicago who specialises in hair loss. When should you go? Ideally, before you become really worried about your hair, the dermatologists said. That’s because medications are generally better at preventing hair loss than reversing it. “The earlier you start, the more likely you are to retain the hair that you have,” Dr Mostaghimi said. THE FIRST-LINE MEDICATIONS Dermatologists generally recommend two drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration: Minoxidil and finasteride. Minoxidil is the best known. “It does work to grow hair,” Dr Del Campo said – when patients apply it at least daily and preferably twice a day. It comes in a foam or drops. He recommended using a formulation without propylene glycol, which can irritate the scalp . It takes a few months to regrow mature hair, but topical minoxidil doesn’t work well for everyone and experts said many dislike having to apply it so often. Also, as with any hair-loss treatment, if a patient stops taking it, he will lose any previous gains and his hairline will continue retreating, Dr Mostaghimi said. Another option is taking minoxidil in pill form , an off-label therapy that some dermatologists have used for years. However, pills cause hair to grow indiscriminately, including on the beard or armpits, though it varies by patient, Dr Del Campo said. Finasteride is approved in pill form for male hair loss with a prescription. Studies have suggested most men who use finasteride either maintained or improved their hair coverage over five years. Taking oral finasteride holds a small risk of erectile dysfunction, Dr Del Campo said, which usually ends when a patient stops taking it. Still, he said, “That’s something I take seriously when discussing it with my patients.” Finasteride is also available as a spray or drops. Topical formulations are not approved by the FDA but have become popular with online purveyors that may prescribe them using just an online survey. They’ve been shown to work with fewer side effects than the pill, Dr Del Campo said, but he stressed the importance of talking to a dermatologist before buying prescription drugs online. Comparing finasteride to minoxidil gets tricky, as studies often measure outcomes differently. Minoxidil has gotten better marks for regrowing hair, while finasteride, Dr Mostaghimi said, is often seen as better for retaining it. But there’s no reason to limit yourself. “It’s generally accepted that combination treatment works better than anything by itself,” said Dr Carolyn Goh, an associate clinical professor of dermatology at UCLA Health. That’s because these medications seem to work via different pathways and have different strengths. SECONDARY THERAPIES There are a few other options, but experts say they are not stand-alone therapies and should be used alongside medicines. One option is platelet rich plasma (PRP) injections. In this process, the blood of a patient is drawn, its plasma separated and injected back into his scalp. It’s expensive, and patients typically undergo three or four primary sessions, followed by maintenance sessions every month, said Dr Del Campo. One recent meta-analysis concluded that PRP had promise for some patients, but it was hard to say that with confidence, because the studies had all been performed differently. Experts like Dr Del Campo didn’t recommend it as a stand-alone treatment. Another option is low-level laser light therapy – often in the form of helmets or combs. While there’s some evidence that stimulating the scalp with these devices may help to grow hair, said Dr Mostaghimi, they can be expensive, as much as US$2,500 (S$3,377). What’s more, it can be hard for consumers to tell the difference between legitimate medical devices and scams, he said; they should only be viewed as an adjunct to other therapy. HAIR TRANSPLANTS Some dermatologists consider hair transplants the gold standard of hair restoration. The technology has come a long way over the last 25 years from the days of hair plugs, doctors said. During a hair transplant, hair follicles are removed from one place and relocated where it is needed. This can be done either by removing a strip from the back of the scalp, or relocating individual follicles from around the head. The process isn’t without its caveats. First, a transplant often doesn’t provide instant results. And the original hairline still continues to recede, so the skill of the surgeon is important. Patients will see the best results when they continue to use medication, too, Dr Goh said. Transplants also are the most expensive option, beginning at about US$7,000 and rising to multiples of that. MISINFORMATION AND OUTRIGHT SCAMS There are almost as many myths about baldness as there are fake remedies. Some people say wearing a hat too often can cause baldness, while others blame the lack of hats in cold weather. Both are untrue, Dr Del Campo said. Some believe washing hair too much is the problem; others say it’s not washing enough. (Both are false, dermatologists said.) Some suggest a scalp sunburn can spur growth. (Don’t do this.) Neither rubbing onion or garlic on your head will stimulate growth. (And they can irritate the scalp, said Dr Del Campo.) Rosemary oil has gone viral on TikTok in the last few years. The evidence for its effectiveness is thin, dermatologists said. But Dr Del Campo said he’s fine with people trying it, noting that some products have additional chemicals that can cause allergic reactions. Lastly, the role of heredity adds another layer of confusion. Should you look at your father or your mother’s father to see your future? Alas, neither is a perfect predictor. While genes play a major role in baldness, scientists say, they don’t foretell it with certainty. Balding can begin at an earlier age over generations, Dr Goh added. A grandson can lose his hair years before his grandfather did, she said. “It can happen very young.” Our hair is one of the ways we tell the world who we are – and it also affects how the world sees us. So its loss can cause a man real suffering. But, by starting an open conversation with a doctor as soon as the signs appear, it doesn’t have to be that way. “There’s tons of options, and the future is very, very bright out there for someone who’s been dealing with it,” said Dr Del Campo. “They shouldn’t have to deal with it alone.” By Christopher Solomon © The New York Times Company The article originally appeared in The New York Times .

Or maybe not. (Photo: The New York Times) Brian Byrne, a tour manager in Los Angeles, was sipping a cold brew a few years ago when he started feeling clammy. Soon, his symptoms worsened: Shallow breathing, a hollow feeling in his chest and a rapid, thumping heartbeat. He went outside to get air. “At that point, I was having racing thoughts, feeling like I was having a heart attack,” he said. This wasn’t the first time Byrne experienced a caffeine-fueled panic attack, but it was the most intense. “Drinking that coffee felt like I poured gasoline on a fire that was already smoldering,” he said. For a year after, he didn’t touch the stuff and didn’t have another serious episode. Many people can relate to Byrne’s caffeine-related anxiety. While researchers can’t definitively say that caffeine makes you anxious, it’s linked to increased risk of anxiety among people with and without psychiatric diagnoses . WHY CAFFEINE MIGHT MAKE YOU ANXIOUS Caffeine is a stimulant that affects the sympathetic nervous system – the part of the body responsible for your fight-or-flight response. When it’s activated, your heart rate rises and blood pressure goes up, your muscles tense, and you may start sweating. But caffeine isn’t the only thing that arouses the nervous system. Any adrenaline-pumping activity – like exercising or riding a roller coaster – can stimulate a response. When you’re working out or on a ride, those sensations aren’t a surprise. But the incongruity of sitting quietly at your desk while your heart is pounding, the way it might if you’ve just had some caffeine, can make some people experience that arousal as anxiety, said Joseph Trunzo, a deputy director of the School of Health and Behavioral Sciences at Bryant University. On top of that, if you subconsciously label these symptoms as anxiety, you might reinforce the effect. Other factors can come into play, too. Caffeine acts against the brain chemical adenosine , which slows the heart rate and promotes drowsiness and relaxation. “When we ingest caffeine and it blocks those receptors, adenosine can’t do its job,” Dr Trunzo said. Some scientists have speculated that the blocking of adenosine receptors might contribute to increased anxiety . Caffeine can also disrupt sleep, particularly deep sleep , which helps keep anxiety at bay, said Dr Sheenie Ambardar, a physician specialising in adult psychiatry in Beverly Hills, California. If the coffee is consumed within eight and a half hours of bedtime , caffeine might cause you to toss and turn, reducing the time you spend in deep sleep. Even slight disruptions in your sleep can increase anxiety levels the next day. Caffeine affects everyone differently. If even a small amount of caffeine makes you anxious, you might have a certain genetic variant that influences how you metabolise caffeine, said Lina Begdache, a dietitian and associate professor of health and wellness studies at the State University of New York at Binghamton. In this case, you will process the caffeine more slowly, so it stays in the system longer and accumulates, potentially causing a more pronounced effect. MANAGING ANXIETY IN THE MOMENT There’s no way to flush caffeine through your system quickly, but you can take steps to manage the anxiety if it strikes. Exercise may help distract you and reduce short-term symptoms . You could also take a less physical approach: Sitting with and acknowledging the sensations, instead of trying to fight them, said Avigail Lev, a licensed clinical psychologist in San Francisco. She suggests asking yourself questions like: Where in the body am I feeling this most intensely? Does it have a size or color? When you recognise that you can live with the feelings and are not in danger, they become much less debilitating. CHANGING YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CAFFEINE If you think your morning latte is making your heart race and palms sweat, there are ways to assess your intake. 1. Keep a log “I always encourage my patients to gather data,” said Dr Ambardar, who suggested writing down how much caffeine you drink and how you feel for a month. Note your sources of caffeine and how much they contain. The Food and Drug Administration has cited 400 milligrammes per day – about four or five cups of coffee – as a safe amount for adults. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends limiting caffeine intake to 200 milligrammes for pregnant women. 2. Consider tapering “The best way to find out what role the substance plays in your life is to stop using it and see what happens,” Dr Trunzo said. A few years ago, Dr Ambardar had a patient who was dealing with severe anxiety. He had a high-pressure job and was drinking caffeine around the clock. Over several weeks, he reduced his intake and felt much more at ease. “He was really surprised and said, if he had known that this was the cause, he would have cut it back much sooner,” she recalled. You don’t need to go cold turkey, either. Instead, cut back slowly. If you drink four cups of coffee a day, “start really small, like three and a half cups of coffee, then half a cup of decaf,” Dr Ambardar said. After two weeks, you could drop to three cups, and continue that pattern. 3. Make other lifestyle changes When you reduce your overall anxiety, you’ll be less susceptible to the effects of caffeine, Dr Begdache said. During the year that Byrne, the tour manager, quit coffee, he started therapy and daily exercise. He now has added caffeine back in moderation. You can also take steps to improve your energy so you’re less reliant on caffeine, Dr Begdache said. “It’s really a combination of factors that help you feel more energetic,” she explained. So, prioritise sleeping and exercising, staying hydrated and eating a healthy diet. With these changes, you might find that your latte is a pleasant boost instead of a source of anxiety.

What could have led to her situation and why were her hands and feet affected? CNA Lifestyle finds out from doctors. (Photo: iStock/Toa55) This audio is generated by an AI tool. It is harrowing to witness the tissues in your hands and feet blacken and die off, and being unable to do anything except to undergo amputation to stop the further destruction of more skin, muscles and other tissues – or risk losing your life. That was the bitter experience of a Malaysian beautician, 37, who lost all four of her extremities – along with over S$300,000 in medical fees – to a bacterial infection, according to Lianhe Zaobao . Lin Ai Ling, who had been working in Singapore since 2016, first developed fever, stomachache and overall body weakness, which she thought were signs of food poisoning, in October 2023. She saw a doctor and was given medication. When there were no improvements two days later, she returned to the doctor. That was when she was urged to go to the emergency department. “After that, I just lost consciousness,\" she told the newspaper. When Lin eventually woke up, her “heartbeat was weak and there was not enough oxygen going to my brain”. Her doctor was able to improve blood circulation to her heart and ensure the continued function of her brain, she recalled. However, nothing could be done to save her other body parts. \"I watched helplessly as my hands and feet turned black and became heavier until the process spiralled out of control,\" she said. Eventually, Lin had to make the painful decision to amputate her hands in November 2023 and her feet the following month. It was not disclosed in the article what had started Lin’s bacterial infection and how she might have contracted it. However, it was reported that the doctor had found a hole in her large intestine during her hospitalisation. She was medically discharged in January 2024 and is today, learning to live with prosthetic legs while raising funds for her prosthetic hands. WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED? Normally, the body’s immune system kicks in when it detects pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. “In response to the infecting pathogen, chemicals known as cytokines are released by the body to fight infection,” explained Dr Shawn Vasoo, the clinical director of National Centre for Infectious Diseases. While helpful, this response may also be “dysregulated, and lead to organ injury and a drop in blood pressure”, he said, leading to what is known as sepsis, an extreme immune response to an infection. Sepsis is a subset of the most common but also, the most severe bacterial infections, said Dr Vasoo, citing urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and skin and soft tissue infections as other common bacterial infections. In severe sepsis, organ dysfunction and failure may occur. For instance, there may be acute respiratory distress; cardiac, liver or kidney injury; or shock from the low blood pressure, he said. “This diminished blood supply may be even more pronounced when medications called vasoconstrictors are given to support blood pressure to vital organs,” said Dr Vasoo. While life supporting, the same medication may diminish blood flow to the body’s extremities such as the arms and legs, he said. The fall in blood pressure may also happen with “certain infections that lead to abnormal clotting in the blood stream”, said Dr Vasoo, “which could lead to diminished blood flow to the organs or extremities such as the arms or legs”. HOW DOES IT HAPPEN? While Lin did not say how she got infected, it doesn’t take much for bacteria to enter the body and wreak havoc. “Generally, people can contract bacterial infections through the direct invasion of bacteria into vulnerable organs,” said senior consultant Dr Nares Smitasin from National University Hospital’s Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases. “For instance, bacteria can enter through a cut in the skin and cause an infection, such as a boil. Ingesting food contaminated with bacteria can lead to intestinal infection and diarrhoea,” he said. Bacteria is also everywhere, even in us. “Humans have bacteria in their stomach and intestines that aid in digestion and produce certain vitamins. There are also bacteria on our skin, inside our noses and mouths, where they exist as commensal organisms,” said Dr Nares. Two, infections can arise when there is “compromised organ function or integrity” that allows bacteria to invade. And sometimes, no clear source is identified, said Dr Vasoo, “possibly because the initial site of infection was seemingly minor or unnoticed”. ARE YOU AT RISK? While the incidence of sepsis in Singapore is unknown, infections such as pneumonia and UTIs accounted for more than 5,000 deaths in 2021, which make up about 20 per cent of the total number of deaths, noted Annals . Very young and elderly individuals as well as those who are immuno-compromised or have chronic conditions such as diabetes and cancer may run a higher risk than others of developing sepsis, said Dr Nares. “Patients with diabetes mellitus are more prone to bacterial foot infections due to poor circulation and nerve damage caused by the disease. Patients receiving chemotherapy may have cell damage in the intestines, leading to bacterial invasion from the intestines into the bloodstream,” he said. Sepsis may also occur when a bacterial pneumonia sets in after a viral infection such as influenza or COVID-19, said Dr Vasoo. “Thus, it is important to see your doctor and keep all your vaccines, especially influenza, COVID-19 and pneumococcal, up to date.” There are many types of bacteria that could cause sepsis, said Dr Shawn Vasoo, the clinical director of National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Here are some common ones: • Staphylococcus aureus: Found on human skin. Doesn’t cause infection, unless there is a breach in the skin barrier. • Pneumococcus: A top cause of bacterial pneumonia. The good news is, there is a vaccine available. • Escherichia coli: Part of the gut microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract. May cause an infection with the right opportunity and circumstance. • Meningococcus: A less common bacteria that causes meningitis or brain infection. WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF SEPSIS? Early-stage symptoms, said Dr Vasoo, include high fever, chills and shakes with a high heart rate. The patient may appear flushed, confused and, “in the late stage of the disease, have low blood pressure or a blotchy or purplish rash”. Other common signs of sepsis, said Dr Nares, include a rapid respiratory rate and drowsiness. “Should these symptoms arise in a patient with an infection, it is crucial to seek immediate medical attention.” WHY ARE THE HANDS AND FEET AFFECTED? “When a patient develops sepsis, the body prioritises vital organs like the brain and heart by redirecting blood to the central part of the body,” said Dr Nares. Limbs are especially vulnerable as the body tends to conserve blood supply to the vital organs first, said Dr Vasoo, and constricts blood vessels to the extremities such as the arms and legs to preserve blood pressure during septic shock. “This is part of the body's defence mechanism,” he said. WHY IS AMPUTATION NECESSARY? To save the patient's life. When the limbs die or become gangrenous due to ischaemia (when blood flow and oxygen are restricted or reduced), they cannot be salvaged and may also become infected, said Dr Vasoo. “Because they are gangrenous and no longer viable, an amputation has to be performed.” Dr Nares noted that “in certain cases, surgery may be required to remove the source of the bacterial infection as waiting for the antibiotics to take effect might be too late”. “Amputation is typically performed when a limb has suffered an overwhelming infection that can no longer be effectively treated with antibiotics,” he said.

Here’s what to do about it. The email does not find you well. Yesterday, you were lounging on the beach, or sprawled on the couch with that book you finally had time to finish. Now, you’re staring down hundreds of missed messages. The return to work after vacation can be jarring for anyone. But for people who are burned out from their jobs – a state that psychologists describe as feeling persistently exhausted and cynical about work – the transition is even tougher. While vacation might seem like the obvious solution to being overwhelmed by work, time away can reveal just how depleted you’ve become, said Jeanette M Bennett, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte who studies the effects of stress on health. HOW TO KNOW IF YOU’RE BURNED OUT Burnout stems from feeling like you don’t have control over your work. People can dread their jobs, experiencing “the quintessential ‘I’m overwhelmed, I’m exhausted, Sunday Scaries’” feeling, said Dr Thea Gallagher, a clinical psychologist and associate professor at NYU Langone Health. Burnout bleeds into the rest of your life: People typically feel like they don’t have the energy to do anything except get through the day. Family responsibilities, friends and hobbies can fall by the wayside – even if people have the time for those activities outside of work, they may be too tired, or feel apathetic about them, said Angela Neal-Barnett, a psychology professor at Kent State University and author of Soothe Your Nerves: The Black Woman’s Guide To Understanding And Overcoming Anxiety, Panic And Fear. Taking time off can relieve burnout in some cases – people come back to work feeling recharged and better able to tackle their workload. But when people are intensely stressed, vacation is more like a Band-Aid. They might feel better when they’re away, but as soon as it’s time to return, they become anxious again. To determine if you’re burned out, Dr Bennett recommended asking yourself a few questions once you’re back at work: Were you able to sleep easily during your time off, but now you toss and turn? Does your heart rate jump when you’re driving to work or sign on to Slack? Does your schedule leave no room to spend time with loved ones or decompress? HOW TO EASE THE TRANSITION BACK TO WORK One reason burnout can be so pronounced even after a vacation is that people tend to work harder in the days before they’re off, Dr Gallagher said. It can be overwhelming to go from intense work, to vacation, and then straight back into work. If you’re able, give yourself a buffer day before going back to work, Dr Gallagher advised. Use that time to rest and reset: Unpack if you traveled, get groceries and ease into life back home so the transition is less abrupt. It may also help to outline a quick game plan, she said. Think about what you can realistically accomplish the next day, and make a list you can tackle when the work day starts. Once you’re back at work, pay attention to how stress affects your body, Dr Bennett said. She advised jotting down notes each day on how you’re feeling, and what seems to be causing it. If you notice you always get a headache after talking to a certain co-worker, or if you feel particularly anxious before a recurring meeting, make a plan to calm yourself down. Maybe that’s taking a minute for a breathing exercise before the meeting, or stepping away for a quick walk right after a conversation. Your colleagues can also be a resource, said Christina Maslach, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley who studies burnout. Ask them how they manage the workload, or cope with a difficult boss. You can work together to identify what Dr Maslach calls “the pebbles in the shoe” – the persistent irritations of a job – and brainstorm ways to address them. Maybe you can delegate a task you dread to a co-worker who doesn’t mind it; maybe you can turn a meeting into an email. If you’re continuously struggling to keep up with work, the answer may ultimately be to find a new job – which Dr Bennett acknowledged is easier said than done. In the meantime, she suggested stepping back and looking at whether your workload is sustainable and realistic. If it’s not, she said, it may be time to have a transparent conversation with your manager about what needs to change. And remember that exhaustion isn’t a weakness, Dr Maslach said. “You could be doing a good job – a runner could be doing an incredible marathon race,” she said. “But you’ve got to recover before you go onto the next one.” By Dani Blum © The New York Times Company The article originally appeared in The New York Times .

But is it as healthy as it feels? (Photo: Pixabay) After a hard workout, soaking in a hot tub or sitting in a steam room can be transcendent. A heating pad pressed on a particularly tight area of your lower back can help it feel looser after a long day of lifting boxes or hunching at your computer. “I go to the sauna myself,” said Dr Wen Chen, a programme director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. After a long day of skiing over the holidays, her back tends to get sore, “but after sitting in the sauna, I’m cured for a couple of days,” she said. But is it actually speeding up recovery, or does it just feel good? The answer, it turns out, is yes. How heat interacts with sore muscles is still largely mysterious, but there are a few things that scientists can say. For one, it does ease pain. According to the American College of Physicians, using a heat wrap reduces pain more than a placebo and potentially even more than medications like ibuprofen or paracetamol. But what are the best kinds of heat? Is a hot bath better than a heating pad? How long after exercise is it most effective? Here’s what researchers know about what happens when heat gets under your skin. WHY DOES HEAT FEEL SO GOOD ON SORE MUSCLES? When you warm up a portion of your body with, say, a heating pad, your blood vessels relax, increasing blood flow to the area. With that increased blood flow come more oxygen and nutrients that can help heal your tissue, said Dr Amy West, a rehabilitation specialist at NorthWell Health, a health care network in the New York area. Heat also leads to chemical changes, such as lowering levels of cortisol in the blood. Dr Setor Kunotsor, an epidemiologist at the University of Leicester who has studied the effects of Finnish saunas, said that for people with musculoskeletal disorders like arthritis and fibromyalgia, saunas can lower pain by releasing endorphins, regulating your nervous system and reducing systemic inflammation. WHAT KIND OF HEAT IS BEST? There are many different ways to warm up your muscles: Saunas , hot tubs, electric or chemical heating pads, wet towels, a cat that refuses to get off your chest. Which ones should you use and when? Several small studies have suggested that heat coming from a wet source, like a hot water bottle or moist towel, can be more effective than dry heat for preventing pain and reducing muscle damage from exercise. One study, conducted on participants who did a series of squats designed to make their quadriceps sore, suggested that moist heat penetrates deeper into tissue faster and works more quickly than dry heat. However, most studies in this area have focused on small heating sources, like heating pads or wraps. It’s not clear whether full-body heat immersion, like using a hot tub or sauna, has the same effect on muscles as localised heat applied directly to an area. Theoretically, immersion should have a similar effect, Dr Chen said, on a larger scale. Rather than simply increasing blood flow to a small area, a hot tub or sauna speeds up circulation throughout your body and directs blood flow away from your muscles and toward your skin. But most of the relevant research has focused on how regular immersive heat, like a sauna several times a week, might improve health over time, rather than how a single session after a hard tennis game might make you feel. WHAT ABOUT TEMPERATURE AND TIMING? To trigger many of the benefits of heat therapy, Dr West said, “it has to be fairly hot to see some of these responses.” Studies in animals have suggested that heat can have completely different effects depending on the exact temperature. Temperatures between 39 to 40 degrees Celsius can increase inflammatory responses associated with pain. Temperatures over 41 can have the opposite effect, reducing inflammation and pain, explained DrChen. That’s pretty hot for whole-body heat immersion, said Dr Chen, and most hot tubs are built to top out at 40 degrees to avoid heat stroke . Local heat is less likely to give you heat stroke than immersive heat, but you should still be careful that your water bottle or heating pad is not so hot that it can burn you (which can happen if your skin reaches about 43.3 degrees ). “That is something that actually happens more than you would think,” Dr West said. The best time to use heat on sore muscles seems to be immediately after exercise, and ideally for several hours. In a study in which participants wore out their leg muscles with squats, researchers compared the effects of using heat wraps right after exercising or 24 hours later. Muscles that were warmed immediately – for two hours with moist heat or eight hours with dry heat – experienced less damage and retained more strength than those heated later. At the end of the day, there’s good reason to use heat on your muscles after a workout. “Physical therapists use a lot of heat,” said Dr West. “Athletic trainers use a lot of heat.” To give it a try on your own, she said, follow a few simple rules. First, pay attention to signs of dizziness that mean it’s time to get out of the sauna or hot tub. Second, don’t let a heating pad get so hot that you feel pain. Lastly, try to use it for several hours, but avoid falling asleep with it, because the longer you keep it on, the more likely your skin is to reach 43.3 degrees and burn.

Why not join a toilet tour in Shibuya? CNA Lifestyle visited a few of these facilities under the Tokyo Toilet Project that left us flushed with excitement. Japanese toilets designed by Shigeru Ban and Kazoo Sato (Photos: CNA/Jasper Loh) This audio is generated by an AI tool. A few months back, I caught the film Perfect Days. The Oscar-nominated movie by renowned director Wim Wenders followed a Japanese toilet janitor who performs his job with pride and dedication – and featured some cool-looking restrooms in Tokyo. Now, I normally don’t give public toilets a second thought – I walk in, take care of business, wash up and walk out. But the toilets in the movie, which I later learned was part of something called the Tokyo Toilet Project (TTP) , got me so intrigued that I decided I wanted to check them out during my Japan trip earlier this month. A post shared by CNA (@channelnewsasia) THE TOKYO TOILET PROJECT Launched in 2020 by The Nippon Foundation non-profit organisation, the TTP’s aim was to promote the use of public toilets and remove the stigma of them being dark, unsafe and unsanitary, especially for children and women. Sixteen world class designers, architects and creatives such as Tadao Ando, Kengo Kuma, Shigeru Ban and Nigo were tasked to redesign and improve the accessibility of 17 public toilets situated around the Shibuya district – which explains why many of them look like art installations. And as I eventually found out, you can actually take a tour of these toilets. Nearme , a shuttle service provider, organises twice-weekly tours. For ¥4,950 (SG$42.50), you can take your pick from two routes: The East or the West course. The West course, which I took, features nine toilets while the East route has eight. Each tour takes about two hours. Here’s a roundup of the locations I visited. Plus a few more I randomly stumbled upon. Happy toilet hunting! 1. NABESHIMA SHOTO PARK TOILET (KENGO KUMA) Architect Kengo Kuma wanted to make this public facility a site to connect people with nature. Situated near a playground that overlooks a lush greenery of trees, the toilets resemble a village hidden within a forest. There are five cubicles, all covered up with planks of cedar wood, lending them a raw, rugged feel. 2. YOYOGI FUKAMACHI MINI PARK TOILET (SHIGERU BAN) Pritzker Prize winner Shigeru Ban has two toilets on the list and both feature a new technology that lets users know if a toilet is in use or not – when the door is lock, the glass panels turn opaque to ensure privacy. 3. HARU-NO-OGAWA COMMUNITY PARK TOILET (SHIGERU BAN) His second toilet employs the same technology and the only difference between the two are in the shades used on the glass panels – this one goes from a cool shade of turquoise green to blue while the former goes from warm orange to purple. 4. JINGU-DORI PARK TOILET (TADAO ANDO) Architect and Pritzker Prize winner Ando described public toilets as a place where people can seek refuge. With that concept, he created a circular minimalist toilet with the walls made of vertical metal blinders for better ventilation. The rounded canopy is extended out and acts as a place for Amayadori, meaning “waiting out the rain” in Japanese. The overall design is both thoughtful yet functional. 5. YOYOGI HACHIMAN PUBLIC TOILET (TOYO ITO) Located beneath a hilly walk up the Yoyogi Hachiman shrine, the restrooms here used to be dark and uninviting. Pritzker Prize winner Toyo Ito wanted to make the toilets well lit, so users need not worry about using it at night. He designed the space as a cluster of three mushroom-like towers that look like they’re sprouting out of the ground. The brown gradient tiles represent the energy of earth rising to the sky. 6. NISHIHARA ITCHOME PARK (TAKENOSUKE SAKAKURA) The three unisex restrooms here feature bright green doors that are at once calm and welcoming. The word Andon translates to paper lantern in Japanese. And that’s what the toilets look like. At night, the frosted glass printed with trees glows like a lantern when lit. Takenosuke Sakakura’s intention was to give people feel a sense of serenity and assurance when using the facility. 7. NANAGO DORI PARK TOILET (KAZOO SATO) Named Hi Toilet , the white spherical shape of the structure looks like a scene right out of a sci-fi movie. With Hi Toilet, Kazoo and his team aimed to make this the world’s most hygienic toilet using voice control technology. Users can open the door, change the color of the lights, flush and even play music, all without making any form of physical contact. The globe shape also allows for better air circulation and keeps the toilet from smelling bad. 8. NISHISANDO PUBLIC TOILET (SOU FUJIMOTO) Sou Fujimoto embraced a playful approach to his design. He wanted the toilets to feel like an urban water fountain in the city and a vessel that serves everyone. The concave sink at the centre feature taps of different heights so that users of all ages can wash their hands conveniently. The cut-through path across the structure also creates a sense of openness and safety for the public. 9. JINGUMAE PUBLIC TOILET (NIGO) Japanese fashion designer, DJ record producer and entrepreneur Nigo designed the toilet near Harajuku where Japanese street fashion originated. Simple yet playful, he approached the design of the restroom based on comfort and easy accessibility. The structure, partially surrounded by white fences and mint green doors, resembles how one would doodle a house as a child. 10. SASAZUKA GREENWAY PUBLIC TOILET (JUNKO KOBAYASHI) Built just beneath the Keio line Sasazuka train station, the group of weather resistant cylinders are constructed with a yellow canopy to counter the claustrophobic feeling of being located under the train tracks. While the exterior looks rusty and worn out, the restrooms feel bright and clean. The cute bunnies peeking out of the wall light up at night, giving out a playful vibe. 11. HATAGAYA PUBLIC TOILET (MILES PENNINGTON/ UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO DLX DESIGN LAB) British designer and professor Miles Pennington, together with the University of Tokyo DLX Design Lab, wanted to build a restroom that not only serves its function, but also doubles up as an area to bring the local community together. The structure is designed such that it can also be used as a space for events or pop ups. 12. HIGASHI SANCHOME PUBLIC TOILET (NAO TAMURA) Product designer Nao Tamura’s approach her design as traditional Japanese gift wrapping, with the intention for users to feel safe and have a sense of privacy. Striking red is used on the exterior because it attracts attention, and she hopes that it will also deter unlawful acts. 13. EBISU EAST PARK TOILET (FUMIHIKO MAKI) Located near a playground that has long been a part of the local community, Pritzker Prize winner Fumihiko Maki designed the facility as a white pavilion with curvy roof as well as a little courtyard at the centre that is bright airy and a place for resting. This place is also known as the Squid Toilet because the park was formerly known as Octopus Park due to the octopus-shaped slides in playground. While I didn’t manage to visit all the toilets under the TTP, the experience was more than enough to give me a better understanding of Japan’s cultural values and innovative designs (not to mention their outlook on hygiene). Hopefully, it inspires other cities and organisations to rethink these often overlooked and undervalued public places. Copyright© Mediacorp 2024. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

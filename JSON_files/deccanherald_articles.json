    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: Bank and demat account deposits apart from cash worth about Rs 37 crore has been seized by the ED as part of a money laundering probe against a Mumbai-based financial consultant and his company who are alleged to have duped investors of Rs 600 crore through a Ponzi scheme . The federal agency said on Sunday that the action was undertaken after carrying out raids in the metropolitan city on June 21 against Amber Dalal and his company Ritz Consultancy Services. The Enforcement Directorate case of money laundering stems from a Mumbai Police FIR that charged the Chartered Accountant and his company with taking money from investors through a \"suspected Ponzi scheme that promised high returns.\" Dalal \"absconded\" with this money after giving initial returns. It has been gathered that Dalal raised more than Rs 600 crore from 1,300 investors, the ED said in a statement. He was arrested by the EOW, Mumbai Police and is presently under judicial custody, it said. Dalal raised money from investors on the pretext that he invested the funds in nine commodities like gold, silver, crude oil, natural gas, zinc, lead, nickel, copper, aluminium and their trade, ensuring the capital is safe and promising an annual return of 18-22 per cent to his investors, the ED alleged. Using the same modus operandi, he raised money from investors in UAE and USA as well, it said. The search operations unveiled a network of stockbrokers, investment advisors who brought clients in lieu of commission. It is also found that payment received from new investment were being utilised to pay out the monthly returns to the old investors, it said. Dalal \"diverted\" the funds received in Ritz's account to personal accounts, which were further routed to family member's accounts and used for creating assets, the ED said. He \"diverted\" about Rs 51 crore to his personal accounts. These funds were used to acquire assets in India and abroad, it said. The ED has identified eight such immovable properties in India and two abroad. \"Other than from banking channels, investments were made through cash as well, which was then infused in books as accommodation entries in connivance with Mumbai-based jewellers. \"Returns on such cash-based investments were given to investors in India and abroad (including UK, UAE) by hawala operators,\" the ED said. Cash, bank deposits, Demat account holdings to the tune of Rs 37 crore have been frozen and various incriminating documents, digital devices have been seized during the searches, it said. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : For thousands of years, philosophers have argued about the purpose of language. Plato believed it was essential for thinking. Thought \"is a silent inner conversation of the soul with itself,\" he wrote. Many modern scholars have advanced similar views. Starting in the 1960s, Noam Chomsky, a linguist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argued that we use language for reasoning and other forms of thought. \"If there is a severe deficit of language, there will be severe deficit of thought,\" he wrote. As an undergraduate, Evelina Fedorenko took Chomsky's class and heard him describe his theory. \"I really liked the idea,\" she recalled. But she was puzzled by the lack of evidence. \"A lot of things he was saying were just stated as if they were facts -- the truth.\" Fedorenko went on to become a cognitive neuroscientist at MIT, using brain scanning to investigate how the brain produces language. And after 15 years, her research has led her to a startling conclusion: We don't need language to think. \"When you start evaluating it, you just don't find support for this role of language in thinking,\" she said. When Fedorenko began this work in 2009, studies had found that the same brain regions required for language were also active when people reasoned or carried out arithmetic. But Fedorenko and other researchers discovered that this overlap was a mirage. Part of the trouble with the early results was that the scanners were relatively crude. Scientists made the most of their fuzzy scans by combining the results from all their volunteers, creating an overall average of brain activity. In her own research, Fedorenko used more powerful scanners and ran more tests on each volunteer. Those steps allowed her and her colleagues to gather enough data from each person to create a fine-grained picture of an individual brain. The scientists then ran studies to pinpoint brain circuits that were involved in language tasks, such as retrieving words from memory and following rules of grammar. In a typical experiment, volunteers read gibberish, followed by real sentences. The scientists discovered certain brain regions that became active only when volunteers processed actual language. Each volunteer had a language network -- a constellation of regions that become active during language tasks. \"It's very stable,\" Fedorenko said. \"If I scan you today, and 10 or 15 years later, it's going to be in the same place.\" The researchers then scanned the same people as they performed different kinds of thinking, such as solving a puzzle. \"Other regions in the brain are working really hard when you're doing all these forms of thinking,\" she said. But the language networks stayed quiet. \"It became clear that none of those things seem to engage language circuits.\" In a paper published Wednesday in Nature, Fedorenko and her colleagues argued that studies of people with brain injuries point to the same conclusion. Strokes and other forms of brain damage can wipe out the language network, leaving people struggling to process words and grammar, a condition known as aphasia. But scientists have discovered that people can still do algebra and play chess even with aphasia. In experiments, people with aphasia can look at two numbers -- 123 and 321, say -- and recognize that, by using the same pattern, 456 should be followed by 654. If language is not essential for thought, then what is language for? Communication, Fedorenko and her colleagues argue. Chomsky and other researchers have rejected that idea, pointing out the ambiguity of words and the difficulty of expressing our intuitions out loud. \"The system is not well designed in many functional respects,\" Chomsky once said. But large studies have suggested that languages have been optimized to transfer information clearly and efficiently. In one study, researchers found that frequently used words are shorter, making languages easier to learn and speeding the flow of information. In another study, researchers who investigated 37 languages found that the rules of grammar put words close to each other so that their combined meaning is easier to understand. Kyle Mahowald, a linguist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in the new work, said separating thought and language could help explain why artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT are so good at some tasks and so bad at others. Computer scientists train these programs on vast amounts of text, uncovering rules about how words are connected. Mahowald suspects that these programs are starting to mimic the language network in the human brain -- but falling short on reasoning. \"It's possible to have very fluent grammatical text that may or may not have coherent underlying thought,\" Mahowald said. Fedorenko noted that many people intuitively believe that language is essential to thought because they have an inner voice narrating their every thought. But not everyone has this ongoing monologue. And few studies have investigated the phenomenon. \"I don't have a model of this yet,\" she said. \"I haven't even done what I would need to do to speculate in this way.\" #Elections2024"

Armed gangs, known locally as bandits, have frequently raided communities in the northwest, kidnapping residents, students and motorists for ransom. Residents said gunmen on motorbikes arrived in Maidabino village in Danmusa local government area of Katsina, and started shooting sporadically, forcing residents to flee. Hassan Aliyu told Reuters by phone that the attack took residents by surprise and dozens of women and children were confirmed missing. \"They killed seven people, including burning two children,\" Aliyu said. \"They spent more than six hours destroying our properties.\" Auwalu Ismail, another resident, said the gunmen first blocked all roads leading to Maidabino before the attack. \"They burnt down our shops, vehicles, and took away our livestock. They also kidnapped my wife and more than 100 women and children,\" he said. Katsina state police spokesperson Abubakar Aliyu Sadiq confirmed the attack and the seven deaths but would not say whether anyone was missing. He said police were investigating. \"The remaining men who did not flee are living in fear ... and waiting to hear news about their abducted loved ones,\" said Muhammad Sani, whose sister was abducted. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The train accident in West Bengal’s Darjeeling district on Monday in which 10 persons were killed and many others injured adds to the poor record of safety of Indian Railways. The accident happened when a goods train collided with a stationary Kanchenjunga Express. It is believed to have been caused by human error, though it is yet to be finally confirmed by investigation. Last year, some 290 people were killed in an accident in Balasore in Odisha. An accident on the Chennai-Howrah line claimed 15 lives after that. In February this year, a freight train travelled without a driver for about 70 km from Kathua in Jammu to Dasuya in Punjab. Accidents have taken place in many other parts of the country, though the casualties may not have been high. They cause loss of lives, damage to Railways’ assets, and disruption of services. They also affect the reputation of the Railways which is the country’s biggest carrier and transports millions of people and moves huge amounts of goods every day. According to reports, the automatic signalling system in a section of the line was defective and the goods train driver disregarded the signal. There were announcements after the Balasore tragedy that safety measures would be enhanced to prevent or minimise mishaps. Kavach, an automatic train protection system designed to prevent train collisions, was unveiled some years ago. It is yet to be installed fully across the railway system, and at the current pace, it will take many years to complete the work. Apart from this, there are several other factors that contribute to train accidents. Defective or deficient infrastructure, technological inadequacy and unmanned crossings are some of them. Various committees have recommended measures like upgradation of infrastructure and reforms like the setting up of an independent safety commission but many of them are yet to be acted upon. The government has recently placed a lot of emphasis on running high-profile trains like Vande Bharat and Namo Bharat. Bullet trains have also received much attention. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida last week decided to expedite the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project. These are ambitious plans and would provide the Railways with good optics and refurbish its image. But it is important to improve the safety standards in all trains and ensure that there is no danger to the life and limbs of passengers in trains. According to the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India (CAG), the spending on basic railway maintenance has fallen since 2017. Providing safe travel to passengers is the first and foremost responsibility of the Railways. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Delhi Lieutenant-Governor V K Saxena’s decision to sanction the prosecution of author Arundhati Roy and academic Sheikh Showkat Hussain for speeches made 14 years ago is the first major signal from the new government that its vindictive instincts and habits are still intact. The two are sought to be prosecuted under Section 13 of the UAPA, which pertains to inciting unlawful activities, and is punishable with up to seven years of imprisonment. The case is based on provocative speeches about the separation of Kashmir from India, which the two made at a meeting in 2010 in Delhi. An FIR had been filed against the two in 2010 and sanction had earlier been given for prosecution only under IPC Sections. But the more stringent UAPA has been invoked now, perhaps as an afterthought, and it will make bail extremely difficult. Trial is unlikely to take place soon and that will mean jail for an indefinite period for the two. There are no convincing reasons for reviving the case and to add UAPA teeth to it after all these years. No-one would have to agree with Arundhati Roy’s opinion on the status of Kashmir to see that there is no reasonable case to prosecute her on its basis. A major ground for questioning the bona fides of the decision is, apart from the long lapse of time, the change in stance of Delhi Police. It had not initially considered invoking the UAPA in the case. The rationale for invoking it on the basis of a speech is questionable. The Supreme Court has said in the Kedarnath Singh judgement and in other orders that there has to be ‘actual violence or incitement to violence’ for legal action in a sedition case. The unlawful activity Arundhati Roy has been accused of would relate to sedition, though it is not spelt out as such. The sedition clause may not have been invoked against her because the Supreme Court has kept all sedition cases in abeyance pending a decision on its constitutionality. But what the court said about sedition should be applicable to the case against her, too. The action against the writer has also been criticised on the ground of violation of the right to free speech and expression. She has been a persistent critic of the government and its policies and prosecuting her will be considered as yet another case of persecution and harassment of critics and dissenters. She is a writer and activist of international standing and repute. The action against her, with political targeting and harassment written all over it, can only add more black to India’s image as a country where democratic freedoms are under increasing attack. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Mumbai: Amid the backdrop of the Lok Sabha elections and the widening rift between the Marathas and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) over the reservation issue in Maharashtra, the BJP-led Maha Yuti (NDA) dispensation is set to face rough weather during the monsoon session with the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (I.N.D.I.A) has armed itself with multiple issues. The 27 June-12 July session is expected to be the last sitting for the 14th Maharashtra Legislative Assembly - as the elections of the western Indian state is due in October 2024. Post the fortnight-long session, in the run up to the Vidhan Sabha polls, a lot of political churning is expected involving the two mega-alliances - the Maha Yuti comprising BJP, Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar-led NCP and MVA comprising Congress, Uddhav Thackeray-headed Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP). It is noteworthy to mention here that during the course of the session, 15 vacancies of the Maharashtra Legislative Council would be filled. Elections for four Graduates’/Teachers’ seats of Council are scheduled on 26 June and the vacancies and the counting would be taken up on 1 July. The biennial elections for 11 seats of the Council is scheduled on 12 July. Ajit Pawar, who is also the state’s Finance Minister, would table the Budget for 2024-25 on 28 June - as during the previous session the state had tabled a Vote on Account in view of the general elections. With both sides trying to poach each other’s MLAs, the session is going to be crucial. Since the 2019 Vidhan Sabha polls, there has been a turmoil in Maharashtra politics with splitting of two parties - Shiv Sena and NCP and three different governments. The period saw three Chief Ministers - Devendra Fadnavis, Uddhav Thackeray and Eknath Shinde, Ajit Pawar being Deputy Chief Minister in three governments and three Leaders of Opposition - Devendra Fadnavis, Ajit Pawar and Vijay Wadettiwar. One of the crucial issues, which is double-edged and can damage both the ruling side and opposition is the reservation issue. The five back-to-back hunger strikes by Manoj Jarange-Patil demanding reservation for Marathas as OBCs and Prof Laxman Hake, who is opposing the dilution of OBC quota has emerged as a big issue. It's going to be a tight-rope walk for Shinde-Fadnavis-Pawar. The BJP has already faced the brunt as it was reduced to nine seats in 2024 Lok Sabha polls from 23 in 2014 and 2019. If one looks at the performance of the LS polls in the Assembly segments, the MVA is ahead in 150-plus seats of the 288 in Maharashtra. The drought in parts of Maharashtra and agrarian distress is also a big issue. The law and order situation like Pune's Porsche hit-and-run incident, increase in crime in big urban cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Aurangabad, Nagpur and its metropolitan regions are major issues. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : On the frontlines of the Ukraine war, the country's soldiers were seen rolling out their mats to participate in yoga , according to a report by The Times of India . Claiming that yoga has helped him transform his life, the commander, aged 37, at the post of the 225th Separate Assault Brigade amongst the soldiers said, \"Before the beginning of the full-scale war, back in 2014, I was drafted into infantry operations, and I hurt my spine.\" According to TOI , he further said, \"I started practicing yoga regularly in 2016. All my problems disappeared\", adding that yoga helps with his responsibilities in the war. The young commander also said, \"I always try to do asanas, pranayama and I read the 'Hare Krishna Mahamantra'. It helps me have better control over my emotions and plan things in my duty.\" The war-hit Ukraine is witnessing a rise in yoga awareness for better healing, wellness and recovery among its population. With some special forces units of the Ukrainian Army including yoga in their training, several projects have been started to support the Ukrainian teachers who have been teaching yoga and to help those who have been dealing with trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Initiated by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in 2021, a 'Healthy Ukraine' programme was started to encourage the ancient physical, mental and spiritual practice. During 'Active Parks' - a project under the initiated programme - public parks were transformed into fitness clubs where instructors or teachers would organise and hold free yoga training classes. According to TOI , Elena Siderska, who was accountable for boosting yoga in the project said, \"The response for yoga was overwhelming. Active Parks now supports studios and clubs that work with trauma, PTSD and rehabilitation of soldiers.\" According to the publication, a master of yoga and Elena's father, Andrii Siderskyi claimed that yoga's roots have been in his country for a long time saying, \"Actually people in Ukraine came in contact with yoga as far back as the 19th century. But after the revolution of 1917 and the Ukrainian Republic, it was little bit lost. However, following the World War II, Kyiv, Odessa and Kharkiv became some of the main centres of yoga in the Soviet era.\" Siderskyi also said, \"We combined specific pranayama sequences with asana sequences that we found most effective for our conditions. I believe this saved thousands of lives and helped people recover quickly during Covid.\" One person named Yullia Denisova who was helping injured Ukrainian comrades at four different rehabilitation centres and also works at the 'Fierce Calm', says, \"Yoga nidra and pranayama have had huge benefits for war veterans dealing with sleep disorders, PTSD and those with amputation related problems.\" According to the publication, while describing how the medieval practice helped a double amputee soldier, Denisova said, \"Nazar was initially unsure about yoga. He said I have come to just watch. But session after session he got into it. Finally, after a session of yoga nidra, he fell into deep sleep. After he woke up, he said it was the best sleep he ever had.\" She added, \"I, as a Ukrainian, can't thank India enough for giving the world and keeping this wonderful ancient knowledge.\" According to TOI , another person named Velaeria Samborskaya, who runs a crowd-funded project to encourage yoga for trauma-sensitive people in Ukraine, says, \"We have seen affected soldiers being fearful of going near parks because they were injured in forested areas on the frontline. But after a few sessions of yoga, especially pranayama, they are able to overcome their mental trauma.\" Samborsakaya also said, \"In the first year of the war, we needed physical things, good housing, etc. After two years, we now need to deal with the mental repercussions of this war and what it is doing to our society. Yogic exercises, especially pranayama, are a huge boon for us now.\" #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : In 2024, India’s ranking in the World Press Freedom Index, according to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), dropped to 159 out of 180 countries, down from 140 in 2014. During the same period, Pakistan improved its ranking from 158 to 152. This decline reflects the current state of press freedom in India and highlights global perceptions. With a few exceptions, the media has aligned with the government’s narrative, often remaining silent on critical issues and avoiding challenging questions. The recent apologies of an interview the Prime Minister granted to select journalists were more in the nature of long monologues than interviews. They were shallow and failed to address pressing concerns, thus reinforcing the derogatory label of “Godi Media.” Drawing a parallel to the mythological tale of Samudra Manthan, where the churning of the ocean produced both poison (vish) and life-giving nectar (amrit), the churn of the last decade in Indian politics has similarly yielded both detrimental and exemplary-courageous journalism. Despite numerous challenges, some journalists in the digital news, with a vast following running into crores, have risked harassment and potential threats by asking tough questions and reporting on critical issues. It is thanks to them that there has been a semblance of balance in shaping the opinions of our citizens, including perhaps influencing the outcome of the 2024 parliamentary elections. The current ranking of Indian media mirrors the lesser democracies, sliding to the lowest quartile globally, and the trend has persisted without interruption in the last decade. Particularly damaging has been the pervasive threat of relentless harassment and threats to life, coupled with the state’s collaboration with crony capitalists to buy out media outlets that refuse to toe the line. Over the past decade, the corporate ownership of media houses in India has become increasingly prevalent, leading to significant concerns about the integrity and independence of journalism. Major corporations, often with close ties to political power, have acquired prominent media outlets. One of the most notable examples is the acquisition of NDTV by the Adani Group, a conglomerate with extensive business interests and political connections. Similarly, the Reliance Group, led by Mukesh Ambani, has acquired stakes in various media outlets, including Network18, which operates numerous television channels and online platforms. These corporate takeovers have raised alarms about the potential for media manipulation and the suppression of dissenting voices. What is more, such channels also get the lion’s share of government advertisement revenues. This emerging trend has resulted in a media landscape where business interests and political agendas can overshadow journalistic objectivity and the public’s right to unbiased information. The systemic problems associated with media ownership unfortunately extend beyond corporate control. Media houses without substantial financial backing struggle to sustain operations independently. This financial vulnerability can make them susceptible to political pressure, compromising their editorial independence. Moreover, without adequate resources, these outlets may lack the capacity to produce high-quality, investigative journalism, which is essential for holding the powers to account. If we are to be seen as a vibrant democracy and improve our ratings on press freedom, we need to introduce a slew of reforms. Expecting this from the current dispensation may well be an oxymoron since it calls for the political will for a free press in the first place. But here is our wish list nonetheless: For starters, we need to rationalise regulatory frameworks to set ownership limits in media companies so as to prevent excessive control; regulate or enforce rules that prevent entities from owning multiple types of media (e.g., print, broadcast, and digital) to ensure diversity in media voices and prevent consolidation of media muscle in one entity; and promote transparency requirements by calling for full disclosure of media ownership structures. We also need to promote public broadcasting by increasing funding for broadcasters like Doordarshan and All India Radio, ensuring at the same time that they operate independently of government influence. Perhaps the Supreme Court can itself suo motu advocate legal reforms like defamation laws or whistle-blower protection. It should also step in to guarantee legal protection for editorial independence within public and widely held broadcasting services, backed by strengthening self-regulatory bodies like the Press Council of India (PCI). This would further help foster exemplary ethical standards and enforce codes of conduct. A combination of appropriate tax incentives, grants, and subsidies, as well as making funds available through measures such as taxing large media conglomerates, would be a possible approach to encouraging growth, sustainability, and capacity building in non-profit, community media, and independent investigative journalism. As a long-term measure to create pull for ‘free’ media, we need to enhance media literacy not only by educating citizens on how to critically evaluate news sources and recognise biases, but also by back-integrating this education into school curricula to equip the next generation with critical thinking skills related to media consumption. The above measures need to be fused with global partnerships and collaboration so as to improve overall standards of journalism and build Free Press India as a brand. We should actively participate in freedom of press rankings and improve our own monitoring by the likes of PCI, or News Broadcasting Standards Authority, to improve our image dimension score (or say brand salience) in this area. In summary, while corporate ownership of media poses its own set of challenges, the solution lies in a balanced approach that ensures the financial viability of journalism without compromising editorial independence. By implementing regulatory reforms, supporting public and independent media, and promoting media literacy, India can strive to create a more resilient and democratic media landscape.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Barbados: In retrospect, it’s probably a good thing that those pitches in the United States of America hid what the Indian team is truly capable of. Even as they scratched, edged and crawled laboriously towards small scores, they never once looked under pressure, but they didn’t reveal their latest avatar until Saturday against Bangladesh in Antigua. India is now more a machine than a team, and Australia will be wary when these sides come in contact at the Daren Sammy National Cricket stadium in Gros Islet, St Lucia on Monday. Australia, not so removed from being as exceptional, but vulnerable after a not-so-memorable loss to Afghanistan on Saturday, will have to put on their Sunday Best and hope India have a dank day at the office. It’s not likely, but then again, that’s what was said when they ran into each other in the 50-over World Cup final a few months ago. Australia were not pegged to win, and yet they did, handsomely so. Even if the players and the management insist that they have put that solemn night in Ahmedabad behind them, and maybe they have, it would be ideal, though, if they use that humbling as motivation to try and put one over the Australians. Moreover, they’re all-but through to the semifinals so they can play the former champions without much, save for pride, at stake. Australia are playing to survive. Also, India have barely been tested in the five games they have played so far so an Australian challenge before the semifinals, and maybe even the finals, would give the analysts of the team a comprehensive game plan going forward. Speaking of analysis, four out of the seven batters who went out to bat against Bangladesh scored at a strike of 150 or more. That’s the change that was expected of them for over a year, and it looks like they’re getting a hang of it. Virat Kohli’s 37 came at a strike rate of 132.14 so that needs to be ejected from the collective narrative, but he did look in exceptional touch for the first time since landing in the Americas. And, typically, someone like Kohli can turn a knock like this into bigger ones in the days to come so that should appease any concerns regarding his batting order, his role or his mind space. On the topic of mind space, no one is in a better place than Jasprit Bumrah. Nobody. The paceman with the mind of a not-so-eccentric genius has picked up ten wickets from five games at an economy of 3.42, an average of 6.50 and a strike rate of 11.4. If you don’t quite get what those numbers mean, these are numbers which most Test bowlers would be proud of these days, and this man is achieving that in T20 cricket. Juxtaposing that against the numbers the Australian bowlers have put up would be unfair for they have been playing on batting-friendly wickets in the West Indies, but still, their best bowler is Adam Zampa, and he has 13 wickets an economy of 6.08 and an average of 11.23. While these individual match-ups will play a role, India’s ability to adapt to the conditions in St Lucia will be tested. They didn’t seem to have a problem against Bangladesh in Antigua, despite spending the first two weeks or so in the US. However, these factors will matter more, especially against sides such as Australia. Australia have come to the World Cup with a plan and plenty of good talent at hand but have come undone. India have come to the World Cup with a plan and plenty of great talent at hand but could come undone. It feels like November 19 all over again, and yet very different. Teams (likely): India : Rohit Sharma (capt), Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant (wk), Surakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh. Australia : Travis Head, David Warner, Mitchell Marsh (capt), Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Tim David, Matthew Wade (wk), Pat Cummins, Ashton Agar, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Bengaluru: With a 2-0 lead, the three-match ODI series against South Africa was sealed, but India were seeking a clean sweep. There were two back-to-back hundreds under her belt, but Smriti Mandhana had her eyes set on a third ton. On Sunday here in the city, the host team treated the near-15,000 crowd at the M Chinnaswamy stadium with a 3-0 sweep quite comfortably but Mandhana fell 10 runs short of a third consecutive century to become the evening's ‘if only’ moment. After restricting the Proteas for 215/8, India, powered by the left-handed opener’s 83-ball 90, ran away with a six-wicket victory to clinch all the three 50-over contests before the teams head to Chennai for a one-off Test and three T20Is starting June 28. Sticking to the formula of pacing her innings well, Mandhana matched her technical ability with mental mettle once again. It was spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba’s full length ball that Mandhana mistimed for Ayabonga Khaka to hold on to a catch at short fine leg. Her 90 had 11 boundaries with seven of them smashed on the leg side. Captain Laura Wolvaardt’s call for her players to put themselves on the line to defend an average total was adhered to. Their jostle for claiming wickets or saving every run as a fielding side, however, was blinded by a more disciplined batting side on the day. Among the other batters, Shafali Verma threw away her wicket at 25, Priya Punia added 28 runs while Indian captain Harmanpreet Kaur’s 48-ball 42 was enough to take them across the line. Having chosen to bat first when the day began, Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits gave the visitors a steady start. At 46/0 in the first 10 overs, the opening duo looked like they were well set to stay deep, especially Wolvaardt. The 25-year-old added her 32nd ODI half-century and went on to build a three-figure (102) partnership with Brits. With Indian bowlers causing little trouble until then, Arundhati Reddy got the first break in the 20th over when her outside off delivery to Wolvaardt came straight back to the pacer in a jiffy. The caught and bowled removed the skipper for 61 in 57 balls. With the experienced Marizanne Kapp walking in, Brits continued to shoulder the burden. That, however, came to an abrupt end when the batters had a mix-up. The run out of Brits in the 21st over with the scoreboard reading 104-2 was the beginning of more problems for the South Africans. Two more caught-and-bowled efforts, another miscommunication among batters for a second run out and Deepti Sharma claiming two back-to-back wickets in the 44th meant the Proteas huffed and puffed to 215 for eight in 50 overs. The target, in the end, was too little to keep Indians at bay. Brief scores: South Africa: 215/8 in 50 overs (Laura Wolvaardt 61, Tazmin Brits 38, Nadine de Klerk 26, Mieke de Ridder 26 n.o.; Arundhati Reddy 2-36, Deepti Sharma 2-27) lt to India: 220/4 in 40.4 overs (Smriti Mandhana 90, Harmanpreet Kaur 42, Shafali Verma 25, Priya Punia 28). Result: India won by 6 wkts. PoM: Deepti Sharma. 3-match ODI series: India won 3-0. PoS: Smriti Mandhana. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Bengaluru: Nearly 73 per cent of online job frauds reported in Karnataka since 2020 came from Bengaluru alone, according to the State Crime Records Bureau (SCRB). Moonlighting techies and students make up 20-30 per cent of the victims while the rest are unemployed individuals and fresh graduates, police investigations show. Online job frauds have risen steadily in Karnataka in the last five years, totalling 9,479 between January 1, 2020, and May 25, 2024. Of this, 6,905 cases were reported from Bengaluru alone. While 4,098 cases were reported last year, the number has already crossed the half-way mark (2,185) this year (until May 25), the data shows. Investigators feel the total cases may cross 5,000 this year but believe job fraud incidents are slowing down because of increased awareness. M A Saleem, Director General of Police, Criminal Investigation Department (CID), said online job frauds were \"an extended form of traditional job scams where scamsters physically stick advertisements in public places and siphon off money by falsifying job opportunities\". \"The setup has changed and moved online but the primary targets and bait to attract people have not,” he told DH . He said unemployed individuals and fresh graduates actively looking for jobs were most vulnerable. Deputy Commissioner of Police Shivakumar Gunare, who is in charge of the tech hub of Whitefield, said that of the 10–20 online frauds reported in the division daily, 5-7 were job frauds. Another police officer from Whitefield said techies and college students, especially those looking to earn during their free time, made up 20-30% of the total victims. Techies in low-paying, work-from-home jobs or those laid off also fall prey to online jobs. Techies from middle- and lower-middle-class backgrounds, eager to earn more, are another set of victims, the officer said. In January this year, the Central Crime Branch (CCB) cracked down on a gang that swindled Rs 158 crore through a nationwide job fraud. While the CCB traced a network of mule bank accounts that received money from the victims, it found that all phone calls originated outside India. Saleem says these calls originate from Southeast Asia, especially Cambodia. Investigations showed many Indians were taken to Southeast Asia years ago on false job offers and forced to run such scams. \"Over 300 Indians were rescued from Cambodia recently. The operation is still ongoing,” he told this newspaper. Data leaks Investigations by Bengaluru police showed that scamsters hire certain people only to identify potential victims by mining their data from banks, post offices, etc. In many cases, these conduits work in banks for months to extract as much data as possible and pass it on to call centres, which later contact prospective victims with \"job offers\". Some members of these scouring team even work as cabbies and save their passengers' phone numbers. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Bengaluru: In July 2023, the outlook for 'Bhajarangi' looked bleak. Having just arrived into the world, the infant lion-tailed macaque's (LTM) life was in danger as his mother couldn't nurse him. Enter: Somashekhar An employee at the Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens in Mysuru, Somashekhar virtually transformed into the \"mother\" of the male infant and nurtured it 24x7 for two months. Eventually, the hard work paid off. 'Bhajarangi' came back from the brink. The zoo made a special mention of Somashekhar's dedication in its annual report submitted to the government. Lion-tailed macaques are an endangered species endemic to the hill ranges of the Western Ghats. They have a striking mane that surrounds their face and a long tail, with a lion-like tuft at the tip. At the zoo in Mysuru, they are one of the top attractions among primates. In the beginning of July last year, an LTM named Aishwarya gave birth to a male infant taking the total number of her species in the zoo to five. Officials immediately started monitoring the mother and infant as insufficient lactation had led to the mortality of her previous infants. Director of the zoo D Mahesh Kumar said colostrum (breast milk) plays a vital role in development of the infant, including boosting its immunity. Authorities left the infant with the mother to allow whatever amount of nursing was possible. The mother and infant were placed in a holding room for close observation. Despite the apparent activity of the infant in the first two days, signs of exhaustion and reduced suckling were observed. The veterinary team, which looked into the situation, confirmed insufficient mammary gland development and synthesis of milk in the mother. Kumar was effusive in his praise of Somashekhar, saying his love and compassion towards animals is \"inspiring\". \"The decision to hand-rear the infant was taken because we had employees like Somashekhar, whose commitment to the work and love for animals has been proven more than once,\" Kumar told DH. \"He worked 24X7 in ensuring that the infant is fed as per the advice and this care was instrumental in saving its life.\" During the first week, the infant was offered with a 'mother milk replacer': eight feedings of 8.9 ml feeding formula each per day had to be fed in right intervals. The frequency of feeding was gradually reduced while the volume of the feeding formula was increased simultaneously. Somashekhar carried out the work without a hitch and the zoo authorities recognised it. \"It's a work that went on for two months and he virtually became the infant's mother,\" Kumar said, adding the infant, which has been named 'Bhajarangi', is \"doing well\". Besides the overtime payment, we have recognised Somashekhar's central role in animal care and management. \"He was felicitated by the chief minister in a recent event,\" Kumar said. Quote - The decision to hand-rear the infant was taken because we had employees like Somashekhar whose commitment to the work and love for animals has been proven more than once. He worked 24X7 in ensuring that the infant is fed as per the advice and this care was instrumental in saving its life - D Mahesh Kumar Director Mysuru zoo Cut-off box - Bigger enclosures The current enclosures housing some of the animals including rhesus macaque common langur and Nilgiri langur will be replaced soon with open spacious and naturalistic enclosures as per the guidelines of the Central Zoo Authority. Director Mahesh Kumar said the designs of the new enclosures will be sent to the CZA and work will be taken up after receiving approval. \"It's akin to the open enclosures given to gorillas and chimpanzees\" he said. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Bengaluru: The Karnataka High Court has reduced the sentence of an accused in a POCSO Act case from life imprisonment to 10 years, emphasising the need for valid reasons when imposing the maximum penalty. The accused, a 27-year-old man from Chikkamagaluru, had his appeal partially allowed by a division bench consisting of Justices Sreenivas Harish Kumar and C M Joshi. However, the court increased his fine from Rs 5,000 to Rs 25,000. The case involved the accused befriending and repeatedly sexually assaulting a minor girl in his neighborhood in June 2016. The girl's mother filed a complaint in December 2016 after finding that her daughter was pregnant. A DNA test confirmed the accused as the biological father. The police registered an FIR and filed a charge-sheet following their investigation. On June 11, 2018, a special court in the district headquarters town of Chikkamagaluru sentenced the accused to life imprisonment under Section 6 of the POCSO Act and imposed a Rs 5,000 fine after finding him guilty of criminal intimidation. The accused challenged the verdict in the High Court, arguing that the girl's age had not been proven with proper documents. The division bench, upon reviewing the case, noted that the oral testimony suggested the girl's consent, although it was legally irrelevant given her actual age of 12 at the time of the incident. The bench remarked that this indication of consent opposed the imposition of the maximum sentence under Section 6 of the POCSO Act. It concluded that the special court had not provided sufficient reasons for imposing the maximum life sentence. According to the law as it stood on the date of the crime, Section 6 of the POCSO Act allowed for a minimum sentence of 10 years' rigorous imprisonment and a maximum of life imprisonment. The court ruled that imposing the maximum sentence required valid reasons, which were absent in the special court's judgment. Consequently, the court, in its recent order, modified the sentence to 10 years' imprisonment. #Elections2024"

Speaking to a young audience at SKICC, he stressed that the NDA government at the Centre is dedicated to advancing the mission of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, focusing on “Kashmiriyat, Insaniyat, and Jhamooriyat.” He mentioned that the world now recognises the changes in Jammu and Kashmir. “Efforts are ongoing to bridge remaining Dil ki Dooriyan, Dili ki Dooriyan (the emotional and geographical distances),” he said. “We all need to work together for a prosperous J&K. In the past, funds were allocated to the region but never reached their intended destinations. Today, the money allocated for specific projects is reaching the right places at the right time,” Modi added. The Prime Minister shared his recent experience in Italy, noting the positive global impression of his government, which has been re-elected for a third consecutive term. “People placing their faith and trust in the government for the third time creates a significant global impact and strengthens international relations,” he remarked. “Today, the aspirations of Indian youth and the general populace are at an all-time high. When aspirations rise, so do expectations from the government. We now have an aspirational society that values performance above all.” He said that the performance doesn’t come through social media ‘bashans’ (speeches). “Nation saw our performance and today, the same government is at the Centre for the third time,” Modi said. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: India's sports administrators would be \"lobbying\" hard during the upcoming Paris Olympics to brighten the country's chances of hosting the 2036 Games where they will push for the inclusion of indigenous disciplines like yoga, kho kho and kabaddi if their ambitious bid is successful. The Sports Authority of India 's Mission Olympic Cell (MOC) presented its detailed report on the measures needed for a successful bid to new sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday. In this document, MOC has identified six disciplines, including yoga, kho kho, kabaddi, chess, T20 cricket and squash for inclusion in the 2036 Olympics if the country gets to host the quadrennial extravaganza. \"We met the new Sports Minister yesterday and handed him the report. The minister said he will need a few days to go through it. But he asked us to prepare another report on how sports can be a career option in the country, how to build interest among youth, how to bring private players into sports,\" a senior member of the MOC told PTI on conditions of anonymity. \"We are way ahead in preparing for the Olympic bid which will take place after Paris. But we will have to do a lot of lobbying with IOC during the Paris Games and we are completely prepared,\" the member added. Inclusion of host country preferences will be discussion for much later as the hosting rights of the Games have not been finalised. The decision is likely only after the International Olympic Committee has a new President after elections next year. If at all, India's bid is successful, the proposed events will first have to be introduced as demonstration events in the 2032 Brisbane Games before getting a final go ahead. During the International Olympic Committee (IOC's) Congress in Mumbai last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi revealed India's ambition to host the Games in 2036, stating that the administration would \"leave no stone unturned\" in bringing the showpiece to the country for the first time. The MOC member said that while the inclusion of these sports would help in enhancing India's medals tally in 2036 Olympics, but the road ahead is not easy as the country will have to extend all possible support in building the base for these disciplines in a minimum number of participating nations. \"The sports ministry asked the MOC to prepare a detailed report about our readiness for 2036 Olympics, including identifying new sporting disciplines which a host nation can pitch for, how to control doping menace, bringing more accountability in the working of the national federations and identifying private entities who are interested in investing in sports,\" the member told PTI . \"We researched in detail and identified six sports in which are strong. We are masters in yoga, chess, cricket, and kho kho is our traditional sport. So these sports will enhance our medal chances,\" the member said. \"We have already submitted our report to the ministry which will take it up with the PMO in due course of time.\" As per the IOC rules, the host Organising Committee of an Olympics can propose for the inclusion of one or more sports, which are popular in the region but that particular event has to be played in all five continents of the world. Also taken into account is the history of the sport and the ease with which broadcasters can telecast it. The MOC member said it won't be easy to win the Games hosting rights as India will have to fight it out against countries like Qatar, Saudi Arabia, China, Hungary, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Canada, Spain United Kingdom, Poland, Mexico, South Korea, Egypt, Chile, Turkey and Indonesia. \"But these indigenous sports will have to be introduced as demonstration events in 2032 Olympics. Besides India will have to extend support and ensure that a minimum number of countries, which is around 70 plus, have federations in place there. \"We will also have to extend coaching support to them and help them in organising international tournaments. So plenty of task is still left,\" tehMOC member pointed out. #Elections2024"

She was speaking at a function where the Delhi Water Minister started her indefinite hunger strike in south Delhi's Bhogal demanding release of more water from Haryana to tide over the water crisis in the national capital. Before the start of the hunger strike, Sunita had accompanied Atishi and other AAP leaders to Rajghat to pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi. Alleging that the dictatorship in the country has crossed all limits, Sunita said, \"it was only yesterday your Chief Minister got bail. In the morning, the order was supposed to be uploaded. Even before the order was uploaded, the ED approached the Delhi High Court. This happened as if Kejriwal is the most wanted terrorist in India.\" \"The ED does not want to give anyone liberty and has gone to the high court against the Chief Minister demanding a stay on his bail,\" she said. Reading out a message from Kejriwal, who is currently lodged in Tihar jail, she said he expressed hope that Atishi's 'tapasya' would be successful. Quoting Kejriwal, she said he was immensely pained by seeing on TV the plight of the people facing water shortage amid the ongoing intense heatwave, he said. \"It's our culture to provide water to the thirsty. Delhi gets water from neighbouring states. We hoped for the support of neighbouring states in such intense heat. But, Haryana reduced Delhi's water share. Although there are governments of different parties in the two states but is time for politics over water,\" he said. BJP is ruling Haryana. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: Citing previous incidences when the Protem Speaker was not the senior-most member of the House, union Parliamentary Affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Friday alleged the Congress of “misleading” the country over the matter and said that he was “ashamed” of such “dirty” politics. The Congress had alleged that the BJP had overlooked its MP Kodikunnil Suresh, an eight-term MP, for the position of Protem Speaker, and said that by doing so, the BJP was taking away the chance of a Dalit leader. In response, Rijiju said that before the President appointed seven-term member, BJP’s Bhatruhari Mahtab’s name, he spoke to the senior most members including Suresh, Sudip Bandopadhyay, Faggan Singh Kulaste, Radha Mohan Singh and TR Baalu. “The government has not broken any rule, it is a tradition to elect the senior most MP with the maximum consecutive terms – Virendra Kumar and Mahtab both have seven consecutive terms, while K Suresh was not elected to the House in 2004 and 1998. The will not be run by pressure; it will be run by the Constitution,” Rijiju said. Alleging that the Congress is misleading people on the issue of the Protem Speaker, he said that in 2004, Somnath Chatterjee was the seniormost (10 terms), but when he was a candidate for Speaker, the Protem Speaker position was given to Balasaheb Vikhe-Patil (8 terms). “George Fernandes then had 9 terms and AB Vajpayee had 10 terms. Why did the Congress not outrage then,” he said. It must be added that Vajpayee was then the outgoing prime minister and Fernandes was an outgoing minister. He also gave the example of the Congress ignoring PM Sayeed and Giridhar Gamang for the Protem Speaker post, and also cited the Supreme Court order of 2018 that observed that the tradition of senior-most lawmakers being appointed as Protem Speaker was not legally binding. A handful other MPs apart from those the minister mentioned, including BJP’s Mansukhbhai Vasava and Ramesh Jigajinagi and DMK’s TR Baalu have seven terms each. Rijiju said that the government intended to run the first session without any incident or conflict. “The politics that the Congress has done on the issue is dirty, and we are forced to speak after we were told that the party is planning to run a countrywide campaign on it,” he added. The ministry also added that the government was also keen on a consensus on the Speaker’s post. “We will soon take steps (for election to Speaker’s post) … It is always good if there’s a consensus,” he added. #Elections2024"

The Congress general secretary's attack comes amid outcry against alleged irregularities in the medical entrance examination NEET and also the cancellation of the UGC-NET examination on Wednesday a day after it was held, citing compromised integrity of the test. In a post in Hindi on X, Priyanka Gandhi said, \"In the last five years, papers of 43 recruitment exams have been leaked in the country. Paper leak has become a national problem of our country under BJP rule which has ruined the future of crores of youth so far.\" \"India is the youngest country in the world. We have the largest youth population. Instead of making these youth skilled and capable, the BJP government is making them weak,\" she alleged. Crores of talented students study hard day and night, prepare for different exams, parents bear the burden of studies by sacrificing everything, she said. \"Children wait for years for a vacancy to come. When a vacancy comes, there is the cost of filling the form, the cost of going for the exam, and finally the whole effort is wasted due to corruption. The BJP's corruption is weakening the country,\" Priyanka Gandhi said. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday had attacked the Centre over the alleged irregularities in NEET and exam paper leaks issue, saying Prime Minister Narendra Modi has \"psychologically collapsed\" post-elections and will now struggle to run the government. He had also said the main reason for paper leaks was that educational institutions had been captured by the BJP and its parent organisation RSS. He asserted that paper leaks will not stop unless that is reversed. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: A Delhi court on Saturday asked the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to respond by July 1 to an application filed by Engineer Rashid, arrested in a 2017 Jammu and Kashmir terror funding case, seeking interim bail to take oath as an MP. Sheikh Abdul Rashid, popularly known as Engineer Rashid, defeated former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls in Baramulla. Additional Sessions Judge Kiran Gupta fixed the matter for hearing on July 1 and directed the NIA to file its reply by then. During the hearing, the judge observed that the charges levelled against Rashid were on a different footing from those faced by AAP leader Sanjay Singh, an accused in the Delhi excise \"scam\" money laundering case. The judge made the observation in response to the submission by Rashid's counsel who told the court that Singh was allowed custody parole to take oath as a Rajya Sabha MP recently. The judge allowed the NIA's prayer for time to file its reply. Advocate Vikhyat Oberoi argued for releasing Rashid on bail, asserting, \"He is the person who won the election with vast majority. People love him and want him to fight in parliament democratically.\" \"It is my (Rashid's) constitutional duty to take oath. I am compelled to beg before them for taking oath. This is really shameful. The court may direct the jail authorities to contact the Lok Sabha Secretariat, direct NIA to contact the Lok Sabha Secretariat, or direct the Lok Sabha Secretariat to specify the date on which Rashid may take oath,\" the counsel said. The newly elected Lok Sabha MPs are scheduled to take oath on June 24, 25 and 26. Rashid has moved the court seeking interim bail, or custody parole in the alternative, to take oath and perform his parliamentary functions. Rashid has been in jail since 2019 after he was charged by the NIA under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for his alleged involvement in a terror funding case. He is at present lodged in Tihar jail. The former MLA's name cropped up during the investigation of Kashmiri businessman Zahoor Watali, who the NIA had arrested for allegedly funding terrorist groups and separatists in the Kashmir valley. The NIA had filed a charge sheet against several individuals, including Kashmiri separatist leader Yasin Malik, Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed and Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin in the case. Malik was awarded life imprisonment by a trial court in 2022 after he pleaded guilty to the charges. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Saturday termed the enforcement of the anti-paper leak law a \"whitewash\" and asserted that the BJP cannot evade its responsibility in \"promoting corruption and education mafia\". The Centre on Friday night operationalised the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024, which aims to curb malpractices and irregularities in competitive examinations and entails provisions for a maximum jail term of 10 years and a fine of up to Rs 1 crore for offenders. In a post in Hindi on X, the Congress president claimed that 70 question papers were leaked in the last seven years and sought to know why the BJP has taken no action so far. \"No matter how much effort BJP makes in the NEET scam, it cannot escape its responsibility in promoting fraud, corruption and education mafia,\" Kharge said. NEET घोटाले मे भाजपा जितनी भी कोशिश कर ले - धाँधली, भ्रष्टाचार और शिक्षा माफ़िया को बढ़ावा देने की अपनी ज़िम्मेदारी से नहीं बच सकती ! 3 तथ्य और 3 सवाल — जिनका जवाब मोदी सरकार को देना ही पड़ेगा ! 1⃣ तथ्य - पेपर लीक के विरूद्ध क़ानून Notify नहीं हुआ था, जब शिक्षा मंत्री की प्रेस… He said the law against paper leaks got the President's assent on February 13 this year but was notified only on Friday night. \"When the education minister was asked about it in the press conference, he had said the law was notified... Why did the Education Minister of the Modi Government lie that the law has been notified when the Ministry of Law and Justice had yet to frame the rules?\" Kharge asked. He said the Union education minister first denied the paper leak and after arrests were made in Gujarat, Bihar, and Haryana, he said the exam will not be cancelled since papers were leaked locally in some places. \"The fact is that in 2015, 44 students were involved, yet the Pre-Medical Test was held again for six lakh candidates on the orders of the Supreme Court,\" the Congress president said. He said that on NEET too, the Supreme Court has said if there has been even 0.001 fraud, then action should be taken. \"Why is the Modi government not conducting the exam again even though the education minister has admitted to the irregularities?\" Kharge posed. \"In nine days, NTA has cancelled or postponed three major exams. Even after passing the law, the leak of the UP Police Recruitment and Promotion Board's (UPPRPB) exam paper in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh has been found to be linked to a Gujarat company,\" he said. The Congress president asked, \"Why are (question) papers still being leaked despite a law being passed against it? When 70 papers were leaked in the last seven years, why did the Modi government not take any strict action against it?\" \"Bringing a new law is merely a whitewash by the BJP. Unless the education system and autonomous institutions are freed from the interference and negative influence of BJP-RSS, this fraud, theft and corruption will continue,\" Kharge said. The National Testing Agency, which conducts the competitive exams, on Friday, announced the postponement of the June edition of the Joint Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and University Grants Commission National Eligibility Test, citing unavoidable circumstances and logistic issues. It came two days after the agency cancelled the UGC-NET examination within 24 hours of its conduct saying the integrity of the exam had been compromised, and a massive row on NEET over alleged irregularities, with the issue now before the Supreme Court. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : London: Emperor Naruhito and his wife began a week long trip to Britain on Saturday, during which they will visit Oxford University where they both studied and attend a banquet with King Charles, but no formal meeting with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is scheduled. Naruhito and his wife, Empress Masako, had been due to make the visit in 2020 when Queen Elizabeth was still alive but it was postponed because of the Covid pandemic. Their first overseas trip together after Naruhito's enthronement was to Elizabeth's funeral in 2022. Ahead of this state visit the 64-year-old emperor spoke of the kindness the British royals showed him when he arrived in Britain to study in the early 1980s. He recalled how the late queen had invited him to Buckingham Palace for tea, which she made herself. \"I have fond memories of the heartwarming hospitality I received from her majesty the queen and the royal family, making me feel like I was part of their family,\" he told a news conference in Tokyo. Naruhito was greeted by officials on his arrival at London's Stansted airport on Saturday afternoon. The emperor's trip is the third state visit of Charles' reign, and the first since it was revealed earlier this year that the British monarch had been diagnosed with cancer. Ahead of the visit, Naruhito said he was grateful the king would host them despite his illness, and he also sent good wishes to Charles' daughter-in-law Kate, wife of heir Prince William, who is having preventative chemotherapy treatment for cancer. \"I understand that they are both going through a hard time, but I pray that their treatment will go smoothly and that they will have a speedy recovery,\" he said. The official reason for the trip is to celebrate the long ties between the two royal families, and to demonstrate the deep relationship between the two countries. The Japanese royals are also using it as a chance to return to Oxford where they both studied at separate times, while Naruhito will visit the River Thames flood barrier which he researched while at university. The visit clashes with campaigning for the British election on July 4, and a Japanese foreign ministry official said there were no plans for a meeting with the prime minister. The official state elements of the trip begin on Tuesday when Prince William will formally greet the emperor, before a grand carriage procession along The Mall to Buckingham Palace where there will be a state banquet. During the trip Naruhito will also privately visit #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Thiruvananthapuram: A day after Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the Congress slammed the Centre over the pro-tem Speaker appointment issue, the BJP on Saturday hit back by asking the grand old party to make Kodikunnil Suresh as the Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha. Both Vijayan and the Congress have claimed that not appointing Suresh, the senior most MP in the Lok Sabha, as the pro-tem Speaker is a violation of the conventions followed in the past. Hitting back, BJP state chief K Surendran said that the Congress should protest against the Centre's decision by making Suresh the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. He also termed the Congress MP from Mavelikara constituency as \"brilliant\", a member of the Dalit community and a member from Kerala -- \"the family home of Rahul (Gandhi) and Priyanka (Gandhi) today and tomorrow Vadra's\". \"At any rate, this man (Suresh) should be made the leader of the opposition. This is how the Congress party should express its protest against him not being made a pro-tem Speaker for two days,\" Surendran said, in a Facebook post, taking a dig at the grand old party. On Friday, Suresh, an eight-term MP, said that being the most senior Lok Sabha member, he ought to have been made the pro-tem Speaker as per convention. The same was reiterated by other senior Congress leaders -- including Leader of Opposition in the state assembly V D Satheesan and Ramesh Chennithala -- in the southern state. Suresh had also criticised the Centre's decision by saying that it amounts to threatening parliamentary democracy in the country and indicates that the BJP will continue to bypass parliamentary procedures or use them for its own interests, as it did the last two times. Vijayan, who too criticised the Centre's decision, had also questioned as to what was the BJP's answer to those who suspect that Suresh, the Congress MP from Mavelikara constituency, was not considered for the post due to the \"upper caste politics\" followed by the Sangh Parivar. The criticisms had come a day after seven-term parliamentarian and BJP leader Bhartruhari Mahtab was made the pro-tem Speaker of the Lok Sabha. The pro-tem Speaker will administer the oath/affirmation to the newly elected members of the 18th Lok Sabha and preside over the Lower House till the election of the Speaker. The first session of the 18th Lok Sabha will begin on June 24. The newly elected members will take oath on June 24-25.

Additionally, the Centre also cancelled the NEET-PG entrance exams, conducted by the National Board of Examination, citing recent episodes of paper leaks and irregularities. The exam, which are entrance tests for postgraduate medical programmes in government or private medical colleges, was scheduled for Sunday.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: A day after the government sacked National Testing Agency chief Subodh Kumar Singh over the ongoing NEET fiasco, the Opposition on Sunday hit out at the Modi government with the Congress saying the buck stops at the doorsteps of the top echelons of the Modi dispensation and the CPI(M) demanding the resignation of Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said the “belated whitewashing exercise is of no consequence” as countless youth “continue to suffer”, as “paper leaks, corruption, irregularities and education mafia has infiltrated” the education system. “In the NEET Scam, the buck stops at the doorstep of the top echelons of the Modi government. Shuffling the bureaucrats is no solution to the endemic problem in the Education system rotted by the BJP. NTA was projected to be an autonomous body, but in reality was made to serve the devious interests of the BJP/RSS,” he posted on ‘X’. For students to get justice, the Modi government must be held accountable, he said, adding that four examinations have been either cancelled or postponed in the past 10 days. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi posted on 'X' that the postponement of NEET-PG was “another unfortunate example of the ruined education system” under Modi's rule. He claimed that Modi’s “incompetent” government is the “biggest threat” to the future of students and one must save the future of the country from it. In a statement, CPI(M) Polit Bureau said “sinister developments” have engulfed the centralised all-India examination processes while demanding Pradhan’s resignation. Referring to exams being “postponed indefinitely in anticipation of what obviously was waiting to happen”, it said it is not merely the result of corruption but of “centralisation, commercialisation and communalisation” in the education sphere, which is an essential ingredient of the National Education Policy. “The new government summoning the services of the CBI to investigate these scams confirms its approach to whitewash, like it did with the Vyapam scam,” it said. “These reflect the complete collapse of the policy prescriptions in higher education for which the entire government is accountable, particularly the HRD Minister. He must resign,” it said. The CPI(M) demanded that in a country as big and as diverse as India, the centralisation of governance of higher education should be reversed and the first step should be to scrap the centralised NEET exams. Every state should be allowed their own separate procedures for conducting admission tests to regulate entry into professional educational institutions, it added. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Tokyo: The European Union is seeking security and defence industry partnerships with Japan and South Korea aimed at joint development of military equipment, the Nikkei reported on Sunday, citing a senior EU commission official. These would mark the EU's first such security and defence-related collaboration with Asian nations, the Japanese business newspaper said in a report from Brussels that did not identify the official. The bloc hopes to reach a ministerial-level agreement with Japan by year end, which could help the EU fund joint projects managed by Japanese and European companies, the Nikkei said. Representatives of the Japan's foreign ministry and the South Korean and EU delegations in Tokyo were not immediately available for comment on the report on Sunday. Japan, despite a constitution that renounces war, says it faces \"the most severe and complex security environment since World War Two\". In recent years it has boosted its defence industry in its largest postwar military expansion, expressing concern about threats from Asia neighbours China and North Korea. Tokyo signed a treaty last year to establish a programme to develop an advanced fighter jet with Britain and Italy. This month Japan started talks with the United States on forging deeper defence industry collaboration under the US-Japan Forum on Defense Industrial Cooperation, Acquisition and Sustainment, established in April by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and President Joe Biden. Japan-US discussions have so far focussed on naval repairs in Japan that could help free up US yards to build more warships, but cooperation could be extended to aircraft repairs, missile production and military supply-chain resilience. Tokyo seeks to counter China’s increasing maritime assertiveness and has expressed concerns over any potential instability in the Taiwan strait. It has sought deeper defence cooperation with the United States and the Philippines, and last week conducted a maritime exercise with the US, Canada and the Philippines in the South China Sea, where China's expansive claims conflict with those of several other Asian nations. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday refused to consider a plea questioning alleged derogatory dialogues and scenes in Annu Kapoor-starrer movie 'Hamare Baarah', saying the film was being released with cuts. A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and S V N Bhatti said the court was not inclined to hear on merits the plea filed by Syed Ahamed Basha. Refusing to entertain the petition, the bench pointed out, \"The movie was screened and the Bombay High Court judges also have seen the film. They directed expunging a few scenes, shots, and dialogues. So this was fine.\" In view of the court's observation, Basha decided to withdrew the plea, which was allowed by the top court. Basha through his counsel Syed Mehdi Imam challenged the grant of certificate to the film by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The plea claimed that the director and producers of the film targeted a particular community and portrayed the status of Muslim women as slaves and chattels who are exploited by the male members. \"Chapter 2 of the Holy Quran has been misinterpreted and wrongly projected as ordaining the Muslim male to treat the Muslim female as his chattel and allowing him to exploit her in any manner,” the plea said. It also contended certain Muslim intellectuals objected to the film as it grossly misinterpreted Islam and intended to malign the religion and the Muslim community as a whole. The Bombay High Court had on June 19 allowed it after the producers had agreed to delete those objectionable and controversial portions from it. The film, 'Hamare Baarah', starring Anu Kapoor, and Ashwini Kalsekar and others, hit the theatres across the country on Friday, June 21. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : During Covid-19, big concerts and music festivals were postponed. Consequently, virtual concerts saw a sharp rise in popularity. The purpose of online concerts was to maintain audience engagement. The stage design possibilities were endless, thanks to augmented reality. The K-pop band SHINee (SM Entertainment) reinvented virtual concerts in Seoul during the pandemic. Artistes from across the world have held concerts on platforms such as Fortnite, Wave and Roblox. American rappers Travis Scott and Lil Nas X gained a viewership of 45.8 million and 37 million viewers respectively. American singer Ariana Grande had 27 million attendees. Concert films In 2023, when the K-pop band BTS’s ‘Yet to come’ concert film was streamed in theatres, fans of the band popularly called ‘Army’ attended the show in large numbers. The tickets were priced at Rs 1,400. The show was in 4DX and theatres were fully booked in India. Sanjivani and Neha Beno, two BTS fans said “I’ve attended two such virtual concerts and it’s always a fun experience because you are surrounded by people who are as excited as you are. I love how virtual concerts can break the wall between people who cannot afford to attend the live concerts. But being a part of a huge crowd would be a different experience altogether.” The Taylor Swift Eras Tour last year became popular among the fans of the singer across the world. Swift hasn’t performed in India so far. So the Eras Tour Concert film gave an opportunity to many fans to be a part of the show. Jhalak Puri, a fan of Swift who attended the show said, “I loved it. Being there felt like I was at the actual concert.” Jhalak who even made friends at the theatre said, “Just like any other concert, even a virtual concert can be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It can be seen as a better alternative and consumes less effort, time and money.” She looks forward to attending more such concerts. Artiste connection Sarthak Mehta, a resident of Indore prefers live concerts. “Audiences will have a direct connection with the artistes,” he added, also saying, “Some fans want to enjoy low key and some want to have a banger.” Pramod Gowda who oversees and executes pre-production activities for P B studios thinks the concept of virtual concerts is a great idea. “It’s an easy way to meet the audience’s needs, increase revenue, and it even requires less work,” he added. “When we plan musical performances, we would coordinate with the guitarist and tabla player, oversee the process, and make sure everything is ready before the crowd shows up. A performance is not complete unless you truly witness and experience the emotions of watching someone perform live,” he opined. However, Pramod also thinks a virtual concert is a compromise. “It’s easy for us to book a theatre and play a pre-recorded concert. But live editing is a highly challenging task if live concerts are to be played. There are a lot of dos and don’ts to remember, and we should be extremely careful.” #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Kannada movie star Darshan Thoogudeepa’s arrest in a kidnapping, murder and criminal conspiracy case is unravelling like a thriller and a morality tale. Heroes who fight evil and deliver justice on screen are always in the public eye and they develop a larger-than-life reputation. Fans adore them, and are shattered when they are accused of gruesome crimes. Over the decades, we have heard of actors being involved in gambling, drug abuse, domestic violence, criminal intimidation and other illegal acts. Hollywood scandal The first major criminal act that shook Hollywood was the arrest of Roscoe Arbuckle, silent film comedian, director and mentor of Charles Chaplin and Buster Kaeaton. In September 1921, Arbuckle was arrested for the rape and murder of model and costar Virginia Rappé. The scandal created a firestorm of controversy not just around Arbuckle but also the entire movie industry. The first two trials resulted in hung juries, but the third acquitted Arbuckle. The scandal overshadowed his legacy as a pioneering comedian. Rejected by society, he died of a heart attack in 1933 when he was just 46. Chaplin story Hollywood was again in shock when the mother of Joan Barry, a struggling actress, filed a paternity suit against Charles Chaplin in 1943. In 1941, Chaplin met a promising young actress named Joan and contracted her for his film, ‘Shadows and Substance’. The two reportedly became lovers shortly after their first meeting. However, Chaplin shelved the project, saying she did not show interest in acting lessons. He distanced himself from her. Enraged, Joan broke into Chaplin’s house brandishing a gun. She was calmed by Chaplin and she later claimed they had renewed their romantic relationship. In October the following year, Joan gave birth to a daughter. When Chaplin denied paternity, she not only accused him of violating the Mann Act which sought to prevent exploitation of women for ‘prostitution and debauchery’. He was indicted, then exonerated, and she then took him to court to prove that he was indeed the father of her child. Chaplin’s popularity was shattered. In the course of the trial, the prosecuting counsel humiliated him and called him everything from “a grey-haired old buzzard” to “a little runt of a Svengali.” Chaplin took a blood test, which proved, as he had said, that he was not the father of her child. But a blood test, at that time in California, was not regarded as final proof. The jury declared him guilty. He was compelled to pay child support. Polanski trial The case of Roman Polanski is another dark chapter in Hollywood. Born in Paris, he made films in Poland and England before moving to the US in 1968. He directed popular films such as ‘Repulsion’, ‘Rosemary’s Baby’, ‘Chinatown’, and ‘Macbeth’ and carved a name for himself among celluloid poets. On March 10, 1977, 43-year-old Polanski was arrested and charged in Los Angeles for drugging and raping 13-year-old girl Samantha Gailey. Polanski pleaded not guilty to all charges, but later accepted a plea bargain. The terms included dismissal of five more serious charges in lieu of a guilty plea to the charge of engaging in unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. However, on learning that he was likely to face imprisonment and deportation, Polanski fled to England and then to France in February 1978, hours before he was due to be formally sentenced. Since then, Polanski has mostly lived in France and avoided visiting any country likely to extradite him to the US. MKT Bhagavathar Two incidents in Chennai involving actors created an uproar across the country. The first was the murder of C N Lakshmikanthan, journalist working for a magazine notorious for its salacious celebrity reportage. He was a habitual offender and had served a jail term in Andaman. On his return, he started his own paper, Tamil Toothu, which turned out to be a yellow journal. Following its ban, he started another journal, Indu Nesan (Hindu Nation). In 1944, he published a series of articles with the title ‘Bhagavathar Leelaigal’ (Games of Bhagavathar). It was about the singer-actor M K Thyagaraja Bhagavathar (MKT) having an illicit affair with a woman in Mylapore. MKT, known as India’s first superstar – his film ‘Haridas’ had created a record for running three full years — was shocked and appealed to the authorities to ban the magazine. On November 8, 1944, Lakshmikanthan was stabbed while riding in an auto. He died at the Madras General Hospital. Eight persons including MKT, actor N S Krishnan and producer S Naidu were arraigned in the murder case. The jury unanimously found the first and second accused guilty. At the time of his arrest, Bhagavathar was the highest paid Tamil actor and had signed 12 films. The conviction broke Bhagavathar’s morale. He spent three years in prison before being released in 1947 after a Judicial Committee of the Privy Council verdict came out in his favour. He lost all his money and died in penury in 1959. MGR and M R Radha The second case that sent shock waves across India had the actor M R Radha in focus. On January 12, 1967, the character artiste, accompanied by his friend Vasu, went to M G Ramachandran’s house in Chennai. MGR and Radha had known each other since their theatre days and had starred together in several blockbuster movies. It was around 4 pm. A heated argument broke out between them. Accusing MGR of destroying his career, Radha reportedly whipped out a revolver tucked in his dhoti and fired at MGR at point-blank range. MGR sustained a bullet injury on his neck and left ear. Vasu pounced on Radha and restrained him but Radha wriggled out and shot himself. Both survived after surgery. Radha was sentenced to a seven-year jail term, later reduced to four years and three months. Kannada producer The Kannada film industry was mostly free of serious crime, until the murder of film producer Chidambara Shetty in the 1997. He had borrowed money from underworld dons. When he failed to repay it with interest, he was kidnapped and tortured. When he died, his body was dumped on the outskirts of Bangalore. Bollywood cases On September 28, 2002, Salman Khan’s Land Cruiser killed a labourer and injured four others sleeping on a Mumbai footpath. He was arrested, and later released on bail. After about 13 years, the Bombay High Court acquitted him of all criminal charges as the prosecution had failed to find any conclusive proof. Salman was also accused of shooting two endangered blackbucks in Jodhpur’s Kankani village. Actor Sanjay Dutt served a five-year jail term for his involvement in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case. Balayya shooting A criminal case was registered against Nandamuri Balakrishna, Telugu movie star and son of former Andhra Pradesh chief minister N T Rama Rao. He was accused of opening fire on producer B Suresh and astrologer Satyanarayana Choudhary at his Jubilee Hills house in Hyderabad on June 3, 2004. However the witness turned hostile and the case was closed. Malayalam actor Dileep was arrested in 2017 for abducting and sexually assaulting an actress.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : At 75, Meryl Streep has every reason to be proud. But she is grounded and has no airs. The International film fraternity is abuzz with the news of Streep winning the Honorary Golden Palm D’or at Cannes Film Festival in May. At the same time, for an illustrious career as her, it can be said that she received the accolade quite late. Streep who gave a new dimension to cinematic acting in the late ’70s needs no introduction. She received 13 nominations at the Oscars. She entered Hollywood during a period when previous stalwarts like Ingrid Bergman, Sophia Loren and Audrey Hepburn were on their way out. Streep filled their vacuum with polished performances of the method school. ‘Krammer Versus Krammer’, ‘Sophie’s Choice’, ‘The French Lieutenant’s Woman’ and ‘Out of Africa’ remain some of her histrionic milestones. Neither Dustin Hoffman nor Robert Redford or Robert De Niro could eclipse her. With the twitch of an eyebrow, she expressed volumes. While she was elegant in ‘The Devil Wears Prada’, in ‘The Iron Lady’ she was full of grit and passion in the role of British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. She once confessed that looks-wise and in performance, Katherine Hepburn was the ideal choice to play the Iron Lady. She was right and her acting abilities are quite similar to her legendary predecessor. Robert Redford once stated that he did notice flashes of Hepburn in Streep when she emoted. She was at Cannes in 1989 for ‘Evil Angels’ and was justly awarded. There is also a hidden fighter in Streep. Streep was a staunch critic of former US president Donald Trump’s policies and also in support of the recent writers and artistes strike which shook Hollywood. She voiced her concern with many workers of the film industry that artificial intelligence was robbing many artistes of their bread and butter. Never has the ebullient actress failed to support noble causes and rise to the occasion. During the shooting of ‘Out Of Africa’ (1985), she had a personal conversation with Robert Redford regarding various aspects of cinema. Redford pointed out that legends like Henry Fonda, Cary Grant and Charlton Heston were no longer seen in international cinema. To this Streep laughed and stated that Redford did successfully carry on the legacy of Gregory Peck and Heston. She did also confess that there was a lack of talent during the 80s in Hollywood. Robert De Niro enjoyed working with Streep in every frame of ‘Falling In Love’. He admired her romantic emotions. In the suspense thriller ‘Still of the Night’, she was bare bodied but never appeared vulgar. In fact she inspired Julia Roberts to move away from her ‘Pretty Woman’ image and accept challenging characters like Erin Brokovich. Whether she faces the arc lights anymore or not is of no concern to Streep. She can rest with an illustrious career which places her among the top 10 actresses of the world. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Imagine a Martin Scorsese film set in the 1960s biker subculture of Chicago, echoing 'Goodfellas' but under two hours. Jeff Nichols' The Bikeriders might be what you'd get. Inspired by Danny Lyon’s photographic book, the movie delves into the transformation of 1960s biker gangs from social clubs to organised crime. Centered around Kathy, portrayed by Jodie Comer ( Free Guy ), the narrative dives into the dangerous world of the Vandals, led by the charismatic Johnny (Tom Hardy, Mad Max ) and his right-hand man Benny (Austin Butler, Elvis ). These characters channel the rebellious spirits of Marlon Brando and James Dean, offering a window into a turbulent subculture through Kathy's eyes. Tom Hardy's Johnny, with his inconsistent American accent, subtly recalls his portrayal of the distinctly British Kray Twins in Legend (2015), occasionally mumbling his words, while Butler appears limited to his previous portrayal of Elvis, serving mainly as a visual attraction. In contrast, Jodie Comer gives a compelling performance, despite her peculiar Midwestern accent. Nichols introduces engaging secondary characters like Zipco and Sonny played by Michael Shannon and Norman Reedus respectively, creating memorable, brief appearances that hint at deeper, unexplored narratives. The cinematography by Adam Stone and David Wingo's musical score complement each other effectively, supported by a few cleverly written lines. While he Bikeriders manages to be succinct yet impactful, it loses its pace in the latter half, quickly descending into obscurity, much like the bygone era of American counterculture it depicts. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Historical documentaries tend to get lost in pedantic detailing and academese. Mysteries of the Terracotta Warriors, a new feature on the thousands of clay figures buried alongside China's first emperor who ruled over 2,000 years ago, is a welcome exception. The documentary expertly merges reenactment and interviews with archaeologists and researchers. It turns the spotlight on an enduring mystery around the \"Manhattan-size\" mausoleum of Qin Shi Huang, the first Qin Emperor who is credited with unifying China's various provinces and building the Great Wall. Shortly after the unification, the then 26-year-old king began the ambitious construction of his eventual tomb with convicts \"collected\" from the provinces doubling up as labourers. The entire complex remained undisturbed till 1974 when a farmer digging a well in the Shaanxi Province came upon a clay head. The Terracotta Army, as they came to be known later, was then discovered much to the world's astonishment — as many as 8,000 clay soldiers had been created to guard the emperor's massive tomb. For all its grandeur, the Qin dynasty barely lasted 15 years and disintegrated into rebellions and uprisings soon after the first emperor's death. A consistently engaging feature, it is heartening to see the care and the passion with which the archaeologists work to unearth long-lost tales of treachery, conspiracy and intrigue. Their dedication is also evidently a testament to how much importance the burial site has to China's history, the details of which remain vague at best for the rest of the world. Another interesting aspect of the documentary is the focus on the artistry of craftsmen and workers who were drafted en masse to create these life-like figures, each with its distinctive features, outfits and expressions. If you, like me, enjoy your history with a little bit of mystery and drama thrown in, this makes for a great weekend watch. The one-hour runtime is a plus too. (The documentary Mysteries of the Terracotta Warriors, is available to watch in English language on Netflix.) #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) has for decades been India’s premiere institute for humanities. Over the last 10 years, though it has been at the centre of the larger struggle between two contrasting ideas of India, it has retained its academic excellence. Thus, it baffles the audience that one would make a film to showcase one’s visceral hatred for JNU at the cost of facts. The film chronicles student activism in JNU through the eyes of Saurabh Sharma, a student. The campus is dominated by left-wing organisations. Sharma befriends Akhilesh Pathak and Richa Sharma (Urvashi Rautela), who share his hatred for the left. They clash with Krishna Kumar (Atul Pandey), Saira Rashid (Shivjyoti Rajput) and their comrades, and join the AIVP (ABVP). The venture pretends to be a work of fiction. However, it’s obvious that the concerned individuals are thinly veiled representations of Kanhaiya Kumar and Sheila Rashid. The film portrays the 2016 JNU sedition row and the events that follow from the right-wing perspective. Sharma portrays the right’s antipathy for the former PM and the university named after him by repeatedly showing Jawaharlal Nehru’s statue in a derogatory manner. This, despite two of the ruling party’s top ministers (Nirmala Sitharaman and S Jaishankar) being alumni of JNU. By hiding facts of the 2016 sedition case, showing custodial violence against the accused and glorifying police apathy to wide-scale intra-campus violence, the film comes out as blatantly partisan. The constant slurs against religious and sexual minorities make the film downright distasteful. The characters are portrayed as black and white. It doesn’t offer much scope for nuanced performances, hence the acting falls flat. The bad editing and poor screenplay add to the mess. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Prateek Prajosh’s debut feature, Chilli Chicken, tells a touching story of five migrants from Manipur and Tibet — Khaba (Bijou Thaangjam), Jimpa (Jimpa Sangpo Bhutia), Ajoy (Victor Thoudam), Jason (Tomthin Thockchom) and Ranjoy (Hirock Sonowal). They work in Bengaluru at an Indo-Chinese restaurant, Noodle Home, owned by Adarsh (Shrunga B V), a Kannadiga. It is a hole-in-the-wall eatery, but a middle-class Adarsh dreams of opening a fine-dining restaurant. He plans to call it ‘Noodle Palace’. The film discusses the everyday lives and struggles of the five migrants. The boys are called names and their neighbours try multiple times to chase them away from the locality. They are forced to sell illegal goods and face exploitation. They endure it all, together. However an unexpected incident changes the course of their lives, and they find it hard to stand by each other. Though they have a salary, food and shelter, what they truly want is respect and a home away from home. Through the many characters, the director shows the harsh realities of migrant workers in the city. Even Adarsh, though a localite, faces humiliation and obstacles on his path to making his dream a reality. The boys, in their free time, participate in Instagram challenges. This adds some light moments to the film, which has an important message. An interesting character is Ajoy’s girlfriend, Anu (Harini Sundararajan). She works two jobs — in a salon and as a delivery executive. She is also an activist who makes Instagram reels. Although the film’s title is Chilli Chicken, the black rice pudding the boys make to celebrate their new year, stands out. This also looks like an attempt to showcase how the northeastern cuisine is not Chinese, contrary to popular belief. Their realistic performances drive home the director’s message. It is not difficult to connect with the film. Discrimination against northeasterners in Bengaluru is common and does not come as a surprise. The city lives with it.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Taylor Wily, who played a shrimp truck vendor and police informant on the television reboot of Hawaii Five-0 and who in his earlier years was an acclaimed professional sumo wrestler, died Thursday. He was 56. Paul Almond, a legal representative for Wily, confirmed his death. The location and cause of his death were not immediately available. Wily starred as Kamekona in more than 170 episodes of Hawaii Five-0 , a re-imagining of the 1970s crime drama that followed the escapades of state police officers on the island. His character became a fan favorite, gradually morphing into the show's resident entrepreneur, running a shaved-ice business and a helicopter tour company alongside his shrimp venture. Hawaii Five-0 could become Kamekona Five-0 , Masi Oka , who played Dr. Max Bergman on the series, said in a 2012 interview with CBS . The series, which ran from 2010 to 2020, followed a fictional state police unit that seemed to routinely crave shrimp. Wily's character was a warm and comedic presence onscreen that resonated with fans across the world as well as with residents in Hawaii. Peter Lenkov, a producer of the series, said on social media that he was drawn to Wily from his first audition and that he was impressed enough with Wily to write in his character as a recurring role. The energy that Wily brought to his performances, even in smaller roles, was infectious. As Kemo, a staff member of a hotel in Hawaii in the 2008 film \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall,\" he provided support for Jason Segel's character as he broke down and needed to regain his footing. His quiet humor brought levity to situations that involved heartbreak and loss. Taylor Tuli Wily was born June 14, 1968, in Honolulu. Although he was known for his tender demeanor, he could be an intimidating physical presence, standing over 6 feet tall and weighing at times more than 400 pounds. In 1987, a friend introduced him to sumo wrestling, on the promise that the friend wouldn't tell Wily's mother. Soon after, Wily competed in a tournament. \"I won a case of Spam and some rice, and that was it, I was into sumo,\" Wily said in a 2016 interview with Sherdog, a YouTube channel dedicated to the UFC. In the same interview, Wily discussed why he was billed as Teila Tuli for his UFC match. \"They didn't want me to come with such an English name,\" he said. \"So I took Taylor and spelled it the way we spell it here in Polynesia, Teila, and used my middle name, Tuli, and got rid of Wily.\" He added, smiling, that he hoped the admission wouldn't send bill collectors his way. For two years, he competed in Japan as a sumo wrestler under the name Takamishu. He won several championships, eventually reaching the makushita division -- the third-highest in the league -- and he became the first wrestler born outside Japan to win a title match. He left the sport in 1989, citing knee injuries, and pivoted to mixed martial arts. Wily fought in the first UFC, in 1993, where he lost by a technical knockout. He first appeared on television in a 1982 episode of \"Magnum, P.I.,\" and he made several guest appearances on shows that included \"Marker\" and \"North Shore.\" His survivors include his wife, Halona, and two children. In a 2014 interview with Hawaii News Now, Wily discussed his appreciation for his role on \"Hawaii Five-0\" and what the experience meant to him. \"It's the best job in the world -- you get to play Hollywood but be right here in Hawaii,\" he said. \"Home.\" #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Mumbai: Yash Raj Films (YRF), the banner behind \"Maharaj\" that marks the debut of Bollywood star Aamir Khan's son Junaid, has expressed gratitude to the judiciary after the Gujarat High Court lifted an interim stay on the film's release. The period drama, set in pre-independent India, is based on the Maharaj Libel Case of 1862. The Gujarat High Court on Friday observed that Maharaj did not target the Vaishnav Pushtimarg sect as alleged by its members, who had filed a petition against the release of the film, claiming that it hurts religious sentiments. The film has nothing objectionable or derogatory, the court said after watching it, and allowed its release on streaming platform Netflix. In a statement posted on its official social media handles, YRF said the movie is a tribute to Karsandas Mulji, one of the greatest social reformers of India. \"We are grateful to our judiciary for allowing the release of Maharaj, a film that celebrates one of the most important social reformers of our country, Karsandas Mulji,\" the production banner said. \"Karsandas, a hero and a devout Vaishnav, stood for righteousness, protected women and safeguarded his community and faith. Maharaj is a tribute to his indomitable fighting spirit and his courage to be on the right side of history,” it added. The studio, known for producing renowned films such as Veer Zaara, Fighter, Pathaan, Ek Tha Tiger, Chak De! India, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Silsila, and Kabhi Kabhie , said it has never made a movie that would \"tarnish\" the country's reputation. \"Yash Raj Films has a 50-year-old legacy of championing India, its stories, its people, culture and heritage. We have never produced a film that has tarnished the reputation of our country or our countrymen. Hope you watch Maharaj and join us in saluting Karsandas,\" the production banner said. \"Maharaj\" is produced by Aditya Chopra under YRF Entertainment and is directed by Siddharth P Malhotra of \"Hichki\" fame. Malhotra also shared an emotional note on social media, saying the film has a story that needs to be told against all odds. \"A film release is almost like the arrival of a child for a filmmaker. The labour of love would like to be celebrated and announced with elan. But when you choose to tell a story that must be told against all odds then the battle will be uphill but hopefully worth the pain and obstacles as we as a team are super proud of the film Maharaj that we have made,” he wrote. Maharaj also stars Jaideep Ahlawat, Shalini Pandey, and Sharvari Wagh in a special appearance. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Mumbai: Veteran producer Ramesh Taurani says the script is ready for the fourth installment in the action crime franchise Race and his banner Tips Films is also developing sequels of Soldier and Bhoot Police . The latest release from the filmmaker's stable is Ishq Vishk Rebound , starring Rohit Saraf, Pashmina Roshan, Jibraan Khan, and Naila Grrewal. The first two Race films were directed by Abbas-Mustan, featuring Saif Ali Khan in the lead. Akshaye Khanna and John Abraham played the role of villain in the first and second chapters, respectively. The third part was directed by Remo D’Souza and was headlined by Salman Khan, with Bobby Deol essaying the antagonist. “The script is ready for the next Race installment, we will announce the casting of the film soon. The cast will be new. I can’t comment whether Salman Khan will be part of it or not. It will go on floors by the end of the year. It’s not decided yet who will direct it,” Taurani told PTI in an interview here. Produced by Tips Films, Race was released in 2008 and its success spawned the 2013 sequel. The third part, which arrived in theatres in 2018, did well at the box office despite negative reviews. “We will also make a sequel to Bhoot Police ’ and Soldier . The official announcement regarding the same will be made soon,” Taurani added. Starring Deol and Preity Zinta, 1998's Soldier was one of the highest grossing films of the year. The action thriller was directed by Abbas-Mustan. Bhoot Police , a 2021 adventure-horror-comedy, featured Saif Ali Khan and Arjun Kapoor in the lead. Directed by Pavan Kirpalani of Phobia fame, the film got a direct-to-digital release on Disney+ Hotstar VIP. Taurani further said they are equally thrilled about their next release, an untitled film with actor Varun Dhawan and his director-father David Dhawan. “We are doing an entertainer movie with a love story and great music with Varun Dhawan and David Dhawan. It will go on floors soon,” said the producer, adding they are yet to zero down on the female lead of the film. Released on Friday, Ishq Vishk Rebound opened at Rs 1.20 crore nett at the box office. The young adult drama is a follow-up to the 2003's Ishq Vishk , starring Shahid Kapoor, Amrita Rao and Shenaz Treasury. Directed by Nipun Avinash Dharmadhikari, the new film revolves around four friends and their complicated love lives. Making a sequel isn’t easy, said Taurani. “The trend of sequels started in 2009-2010 with Race and Dhoom . People (filmmakers) started making sequels from thereon. We believe one has to pay more attention to the script when you make a sequel, because the original film has a brand value,” he added. #Elections2024"

Sonakshi, 37, and Zaheer, 35, wed in a civil marriage at the \"Heeramandi\" star's sea-facing Bandra West apartment with the blessings of their families and \"both of our gods\". The newlyweds shared their news of their wedding in a joint Instagram post. \"On this very day, seven years back (23.06.2017) in each other's eyes, we saw love in its purest form and dedicated to hold on to it. \"Today that love has guided us through all the challenges and triumphs... leading up to this moment... where with the blessings of both of our families and both of our gods... we are now man and wife. Here's to love, hope and all things beautiful with each other, from now until forever,\" the couple captioned their wedding pictures. Both the bride and groom twinned in ivory: Sonakshi wore a saree, whereas Zaheer was dressed in a kurta-pyjama. Sonakshi's \"Heeramandi\" co-star Aditi Rao Hydari attended the ceremony along with her fiance, actor Siddharth as well as actor-friend Huma Qureshi. The newlyweds will later host a reception for friends and industry colleagues at a fine-dining restaurant in Worli. Sweets were distributed to the media stationed outside the reception venue. \"Thank you for showering us with so much love, happiness and kindness on the most important day of our lives! Your support and wishes mean the world to us,\" read a message from Sonakshi and Zaheer. Though there was no official confirmation from the couple, the rumours of their wedding started doing social media rounds earlier this month. While Sonakshi was last seen in the Netflix series \"Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar\", in which she played the dual role of Rehaana and Fareedan, Zaheer had a special appearance in the action film \"Ruslaan\". Sonakshi and Zaheer first collaborated for the music video of the song \"Blockbuster\", which was released in September 2022. Months later, they co-starred in the comedy drama \"Double XL\". The duo didn't publicly confirm their relationship, but were often spotted attending events and social gatherings together. From attending each other's birthday parties, award wins to going scuba diving on holiday, Sonakshi and Zaheer often gave a glimpse into their lives to fans and followers on social media. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Barbados: Kuldeep Yadav had to wait twenty days to get his slice of T20 World Cup action and has since been on quite the tear. The left-arm wrist spinner has picked up five wickets in eight overs in conditions which can be considered spin-friendly, but the wind has been a challenge. Kuldeep had quite the laugh about being called the ‘Super Eight specialist’ since he has only come onto bowl after arriving in the Caribbean. “Obviously, I wasn't playing. Actually, I was playing as a 12th man there. I was helping out the team-mates and carrying the drinks. That is more like playing,” he joked. “I didn't bowl there but I would have loved to bowl there (the United States of America). \"But it's more like an Australian sort of wicket. But here I played, I made my T20, One-Day international debut here back in 2017. I knew the condition very well, just the length and trying to vary my pace.” Kuldeep has been the lead spinner for India for a year or so now, and his impact was enjoyed by the Delhi Capitals in this edition of the Indian Premier League where he picked up 16 wickets at a strike rate of 16.13. The tweaker, however, argued that his performances in the IPL cannot be considered here for the stakes are higher at this level. \"IPL is different, boss. What you experience in IPL is not what you are experiencing in the T20 World Cup. But bowling at the (Feroz Shah) Kotla (stadium in Delhi) teaches you a thing or two because that’s the smallest ground in the country. You have to adapt to succeed there. Once you pick up that kind of experience, you can use it anywhere, but see, it’s all about the length. “Especially in this format, you have to read what the batter is trying to do, but you have to be more aggressive, the approach (to the crease) should be very aggressive. So that is helping me during IPL and it's helping me in T20 World Cup.” Talking about the very real intervention of the wind at the Sir Vivian Richards stadium in North Sound, Antigua, Kuldeep said: “I was bowling from this end (dressing room), the wind was like crossing this way (to its right). It was difficult from this end. I didn't think about the wind, just the length, and then just keep working out what the batter wants to do and forcing him to play against the wind.” #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Barbados: Despite being badgered with questions about his retirement, the team’s drop in quality and the 50-run loss to India in the T20 World Cup match on Saturday, Shakib Al Hasan remained calm. He barely let his emotions get the better of him, save for when he drove into the precise cause of Bangladesh’s poor showing at big events. “When you are playing against a team like Australia and India, you have to bring your A game,” he said in the post-match press conference. “I think we lack those skill and strength areas. Also, I would say we couldn't do the basic thing long enough to be able to create any sort of pressure.\" “Throughout this World Cup, as a batting unit, I don't think we did justice. I think we had the potential to score big runs. The last two games we played here were very good. Wicket probably 175-185 is the par score. We were well short of that against Australia. Today I thought India scored 20 more runs but having said that, the intent we had to show from the start of the innings, I don't think it was there.\" He continued, fixated on the lack of scorers: \"It is frustrating. They didn't have the confidence to express themselves as it was required. Especially the two matches we played on this ground. See, when there is a flat wicket and it is a 180-200 runs game, then we lag behind. We understand the game of 130, 140, or 150 very well. Because we are used to playing this kind of game all the time. So, naturally, since we are known to this, it is familiar to us. When we have to chase 180-200 then we don't have the thought to play such a game. So, you can say that it's our problem.\" The all-rounder also revealed that had it been up to him, he would have batted first. Bangladesh asked India to bat and conceded 196 runs before being bowled out for 146. “Yeah, I mean personally if you ask me in the Caribbean, it's - I think one or two games I think when England chased that 180. Other than that batting first has been the trend for most of the teams and they have been very successful. So, if you look at the stats, I think, yeah, ideally you would have batted first, but maybe captain and coach thought otherwise,” he said. He extended the same pseudo-empathy towards the decision to start with the spinners. Bangladesh started with Mahedi Hasan and Shakib. “Well, that's difficult for me to explain. It's the coach and captain's decision. They decide on who bowls and when. But, from what I can understand, we thought that the wicket would be a little slower. It looked a little drier, maybe at the start of the game. So that's why they thought that there might be some help for the spinners. So that's why I think the captain decided to go with the spinners,” he said. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : North Sound, Antigua: South Africa 's golden generation of white-ball cricketers took a big step towards erasing the \"eternal chokers\" tag by keeping their composure to enter the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup , beating a formidable West Indies by three wickets in a thrilling rain-truncated Super 8s game. After part-time magician and full-time wrist spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (3/27), along with his slow bowling colleagues Keshav Maharaj (1/24) and skipper Aiden Markram (1/28), restricted West Indies to a manageable 135 for 8, South Africa achieved the revised target of 123 with five balls to spare. The Proteas were 15/2 in two overs when rain disrupted proceedings. With this win, South Africa topped Group 1 followed by defending champions England as the second semifinalist from it. Tristan Stubbs (29 off 27 balls), one of the most talked-about among young T20 batters, set up the chase in company of Heinrich Klaasen (22 off 10 balls) for the South Africans. But it was Marco Jansen (21 not out off 14 balls), who hit a beautiful six down the ground off the first ball of the 17th over bowled by left-arm pacer Obed McCoy to seal the deal. Equally praiseworthy was Kagiso Rabada's copybook cover drive off Roston Chase when South Africa required 9 off 7 balls. \"Lot of relief to get through to the semifinal. We would have liked to be a lot more convincing,\" said South African skipper Aiden Markram. In a contest that was headlined by the most revered names in T20 history, two under-rated cricketers held forte. Barbados' Roston Chase (52 and 3/12), who year-after-year goes unsold in the IPL and Jansen, who displayed the less talked-about virtue of composure, much required in down-the-wire chases. It was an unfair rain-rule in the 1992 ODI World Cup that saw South Africa bow out of the semi-finals against England and often the Proteas found ways to lose important games of cricket. But on Sunday night in North Sound, the one-hour rain delay did a world of good for their batters as the pitch suddenly became better for batting with the ball skidding and coming on easily. Also unforgettable was how left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie (1/20), lost his length. His only over cost 20 which did contribute a lot to the co-hosts' defeat. In a game full of T20 prima donnas, it was the Stubbs, Klaasens, Millers and Markrams who had the last laugh over the Andre Russells, Rovman Powells and Nicholas Poorans. On a track where ball wasn't always coming on to the bat, the South African spin troika was excellent with five wickets shared between Markram, Keshav Maharaj and Shamsi for 79 runs in 12 cumulative overs. Skipper Markram, who opened the bowling did a stellar job by removing opposition's most destructive batter Nicholas Pooran (1), inviting him to go for a heave, only to hole out at long-off. Kyle Mayers (35 off 34) and West Indies' most useful player across formats -- Roston Chase (52 off 42 balls) -- carried out a commendable rescue act with 81 runs added for the third wicket in little under 11 overs. At 86 for two, the duo had built the platform for a respectable total with big hitters like Andre Russell and Rovman Powell still in the dug-out but things changed drastically due to the way Shamsi and Maharaj bowled. Both were not afraid to toss the ball up and entice the batters to go for expansive drives and it did pay dividends. Maharaj bowled a dream delivery for a classical left-arm spinner to get rid of West Indies skipper Powell. Maharaj flighted one above his eyeline, drawing Powell forward but it dipped late and then turned away after pitching only for De Kock to complete the stumping. Shamsi, at the other end was dead accurate, not trying to turn too much, and pitching his deliveries in the leg-middle line not giving batters room to manoeuvre. Both Mayers and Chase were dismissed trying to free the shackles. Skipper Markram's planning was impeccable and Kagiso Rabada was only brought into the attack in the 18th over and bowled a couple of overs. Andre Russell, who hit a couple of sixes off Anrich Nortje, could have inflicted more damage but a direct throw from the bowler during a Rabada over found the all-rounder short of his ground and ended the hosts' chances of crossing the 150-run mark. #Elections2024"

Star all-rounder Andre Russell (2/3) removed both Hendricks (0) and De Kock (12) to become the West Indies' highest wicket-taker (29) across all editions of the showpiece eclipsing Dwayne Bravo's 27 scalps. Only two overs were bowled during the South African chase and if there is no further play possible, South Africa, with five points from three games, will qualify for the semi-final while co-hosts West Indies would be knocked out of the tournament. For a game to have a result, a minimum of five overs need to be played by both teams. Earlier Roston Chase's half-century (52 off 42 balls) couldn't be complemented by any West Indies batters as spinners Tabraiz Shamsi (3/27 in 4 overs) along with left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj (1/24 in 4 overs) and off-spinner Aiden Markram (1/28 in 4 overs) ripped through the Caribbean line-up. #Elections2024"

South Africa did well to restrict the two-time champions to 135/8. In reply, the Proteas were 15/2 in two overs when rain disrupted proceedings for close to an hour. The South African batters saw the reduced revised target and improved batting conditions after rain as an opportunity to go hammer and tongs at the target of 123 but kept losing wickets as the hosts made things tight. But Makram and his men eventually got the work done. \"A lot of relief to get through to the semifinal. Not going to be brain-washed by that. We would have liked to be more convincing with bat in hand,\" Markram said at the post match presentation. \"After the rain break, the wicket was playing nicely. We did not get the partnerships to then kill the game. Tried to kill it (the chase) too early, it put us in a tricky position. (The win) is massive for us and fantastic for the change room.\" Markram hopes the nervy win will be a learning lesson for his side. \"We bowled really well, assessed conditions and kept them to a sub-par total. We could have build a partnership after the break and then take it from there, we will take that learning and hopefully not do that same mistake again.\" With the wicket aiding spinners, Markram opted to to bowl wrist spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (3/27), Keshav Maharaj (1/24) and himself (1/28), while using pace spearhead Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen for two overs each. \"We picked Shamsi to have a mystery spinner against them and immediately saw it spinning, so we wanted to bowl as much spin as we can. If it wouldn't spun that much then we would have used our pacers, not a lot of times when KG bowls only 2 overs. \"We have been doing really well, the bowling unit is firing and as a batting unit it is about when to take the game on. We need to be smart on those situations.\" Our ranking improvement is commendable: Rovman Their hopes of winning an unprecedented third title were dashed but West Indies skipper Rovman Powell remained extremely proud of the progress the 'Men in Maroon' have made in the past year. Having missed out on qualifying for the ODI World Cup last year, West Indies cricket seemed to have reached an all time low but under Powell's captaincy, they have enjoyed a resurgence and climbed to the third spot in ICC T20 rankings. \"When you look on a large scale, we have not won the World Cup or in the semi-final, but if you look at the cricket we have played in the last 15 months, to go from no. 9 to no. 3 in the rankings, it is commendable. \"There is a lot of buzz in the Caribbean around West Indian cricket, and now is where the work starts. Continue to work together as a group and make the Caribbean people proud. When we hear the anthem, as players, we feel something and that is heading in the right direction.\" After putting up a below-par target the West Indies bowlers put up an impressive display to take the match to the last over. \"Credit has to be given to the boys, they fought till the very end. As a batting group, this is a performance you'd want to forget. We did not bat well in the middle. It was not an easy wicket, especially to get started,\" Powell said. \"In the middle overs, we lost wickets in clusters. That broke the back of our batting team. It was a commendable bowling effort. We said we wanted to give it our all. They (the team) believed even if it was only 135 (on the board),\" Powell concluded. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Bridgetown (Barbados): Their fairytale run was cut short by the 'Big Boys' but USA batter Corey Anderson says his assorted team is signing off from the T20 World Cup here with its head held high and \"heaps of learnings\". The USA were knocked out after losing their Super 8 stage matches to South Africa, West Indies and England. This was after a reasonably good run in the group league encounters, during which they beat Pakistan and gave India a scare. \"I mean sky's the limit really...the last few years there's always been whispers around what's happening in America with cricket...hopefully in years to come as well, we can kind of grow that,\" Anderson, who is from New Zealand and even played 93 games for that country before shifting base to the USA, said following their campaign-ending loss to England on Sunday. \" I mean there's probably a lot of areas that we need to improve on. We are still an Associate nation, growing, trying to get a bigger player pool. Making it through the Super 8s was obviously a historic occasion for the USA,\" he added. Asked to explain the USA's loss of momentum after a galvanising league run , Anderson said it was a case of 'Big Boys' raising their level when it mattered against a mostly novice team. \"The last couple of games have just been not quite there, but that's what happens in the Super 8 competition is the bigger boys start to really show up and they're kind of hitting their stride right at the back end of this competition,\" he said. \"We don't get to play against these big teams often or at all. So, anything that we can play against these guys is hugely valuable. It's probably a little bit raw at the moment obviously, but yeah there's heaps of learnings out of that,\" he added. The 33-year-old Anderson is just one of the acquired talents for USA. The team is made up of players of West Indian, Indian and Pakistan origin players. One of their top performers was Indian-origin pacer Saurabh Netravalkar, who is a full-time software engineer with Oracle. Anderson said there is understandable disappointment in the camp right now but there is also a feeling of accomplishment. \"...they're disappointed. They're hurt. I'm hurt. Your pride's always on the line when you're playing these games and you never want to lose badly or have performances like that,\" he said referring to the 10-wicket loss to England here. \"But again, it's looking at the bigger picture of it too. If we're a team and we first started and we're beginning to be disappointed about how we play against these big teams and knowing that we can do better, that's a great sign because it means we can give more,\" he explained. Anderson did not play any knock of significance during the campaign and he acknowledged that it hurt the team as he was among the most experienced in the line-up. \"My performance has been lacklustre for what I expected myself. I think as a team we did a fantastic job to get to where we were and we had different guys stepping up at different times. \"Unfortunately, I couldn't chime in and help when we probably, the wheels were falling off a little bit. I needed to play better than what I did and there was probably opportunities that I missed out on,\" he said. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Would studying about interfaith riots that have taken place in the recent past make students violent and depressed? That's what D P Saklani, director of India’s apex textbook writing body, the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), would have us believe. Here we're not talking about school kids, but 17-18 year-olds in Class XII who have chosen to study political science ! If what the NCERT director says is true, then what would be the effect on these students when their textbook tells them, as the Class XII text does, that parties that indulge in ‘vote bank politics’ and ‘minority appeasement’, ‘ disregard the principles of equality and give priority to the interests of a minority group. ’? What would students belonging to that minority feel when this was being taught? Wouldn’t the prejudice bred by such an assertion fuel support for communal riots among majority community students? These are questions Saklani needs to answer. Saklani’s absurd justification for dropping all mention of the riots that followed the 1992 demolition of the Babri masjid and the Gujarat 2002 anti-Muslim massacre from the Class XII political science textbook, would not have merited attention. But given the recent drastic changes in NCERT textbooks, we must heed what the man responsible for them says. These changes have been made over the last five years, though we knew they were in the offing from statements made by Hindutva ideologues soon after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the 2014 general elections . This meddling in textbooks was to be expected. The BJP is an ideology-driven party. Its mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has a well-defined view of Indian history, which is diametrically opposed to the view that prevailed after Independence, which saw India as an ancient land whose culture both enriched and was enriched by the cultures of those who came here as settlers or invaders. Many of the top functionaries of the government, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are RSS products. It would be surprising indeed, if the RSS did not seize this opportunity to push its version of history and politics into education. What is surprising is the clumsiness with which the changes have been wrought, and their irrationality. It was inevitable that the RSS/BJP's main themes would make their way into textbooks. Some of these have been successfully implemented, viz the abrogation of Article 370, the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, and the denigration of secularism as government policy. It is here that the clumsiness comes through. The Ram temple would not have been such a triumph for the BJP had it not been built after demolishing the Babri masjid. Any number of temples claiming to have been built at the spot where Ram was born can be found in Ayodhya. But for the BJP, the correct spot had to be one where allegedly, a temple was destroyed, and a mosque built over it. Hence its insistence on ‘ mandir wahin banayengey’ . Everyone who lived through the 1980s and 1990s knows how many lives were lost because of that slogan. But that’s not what the NCERT wants students to know. It wants to gloat about the temple, and at the same time obliterate the memory of the Babri masjid. So, the textbook talks about a dispute over a ‘three-domed structure’; and a Ram temple built in its place on the orders of the Supreme Court (which in fact, said there was no evidence that the masjid was built after destroying a temple .) This process has been presented as a ‘ classic example of consensus building...showing the maturity of civilisationally ingrained democratic ethos... ’. Obviously, the NCERT assumes that 17-18-year-olds come to class with a blank mind, untouched both by their family background and their social environment, totally insulated from the news. It also views them as mere passive receivers of whatever is taught to them. So, these near-adults are not expected to know what a ‘three domed structure’ is. Nor are they supposed to be curious enough to find out what this particular unnamed structure was, on the site of which now stands the grand Ram temple. These changes are reminiscent of a similar exercise carried out when the first BJP government was formed at the Centre in 1999. With Murli Manohar Joshi as education minister, the NCERT history textbooks told students that Muslims played barely any part in the freedom struggle . This lie was taught to students in Class IX, mere 13-year-olds. This author knew of at least one teacher in Mumbai who told her class that it was wrong to slander one community in this manner; all communities participated in the freedom struggle, she informed her class. Today, when students think nothing of videographing their teachers and handing over the video to political groups whom they know would use it against the teacher, would any Class XII teacher have the courage to tell their students about the price paid by ordinary Indians before Ayodhya's Ram temple could be built?

    "article_content": "Follow Us : By Andy Mukherjee In the early 2000s, Alok Nanda’s new colleagues called him the “bumper guy.” Nanda's job at General Electric Co. back then was putting some plastic between the bumper and the beam of a Suzuki Swift. The plastics division, which traced its history to the early days of synthetic rubber, had hired the young engineer from the state-run Defense Research & Development Organization, placed him at one of GE’s new facilities on the outskirts of Bengaluru, and asked him to find a cost-efficient way to reduce the impact on pedestrians in auto accidents. Two decades later, the former bumper guy and the John F. Welch Technology Center he now heads in Bengaluru are executing far more complex projects. In the process, they’re writing a template for multinationals on how to use India’s engineering talent to create intellectual property, not just cut costs. This is very different from the code-writing work that has brought the most-populous nation global recognition in the last quarter-century. While software outsourcing will face an existential challenge from generative artificial intelligence, the engineering prowess — if harnessed well — will launch the next wave of productive and lucrative jobs. Policymakers in New Delhi have their sight on China’s factory-to-the-world crown. They are spending $24 billion over five years on production-linked incentives. Trouble is, the rivalry is not limited to other Asian countries like Vietnam, which have the same goal and are ahead in the game. The US, too, is running a very generous industrial policy to revive its manufacturing past. While India’s factory ambitions are hobbled by its stifling bureaucracy and protectionist attitude to trade, it’s still possible for it to make a play as a global engineering workshop and research lab. The knowhow it exports will be embedded in products manufactured elsewhere. As Frederic Neumann, HSBC’s chief Asia economist, says: “India’s services connectivity to the world economy is so large nowadays that it ‘compensates’ for the lack of goods trade connectivity.” It’s time to use those links to target commercial services, where cross-border demand grew 9 per cent to $7.5 trillion last year. World goods trade is three times larger, but it shrank by 5 per cent. Take Nanda’s next big mission. As the chief technology officer for India at GE Aerospace, a role he's held since 2018, he and his team are working with colleagues in Niskayuna, New York, on a novel development platform that would, in one shot, offer 20 per cent efficiency gains in future jet engines. Typically, each new generation of engines offers improvements only half as large. “I feel really privileged,” Nanda told me. “For an engineer, it’s like being a kid in a candy store.” When Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp rang the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange on April 2, launching GE Aerospace as an independent public company, joining the party on the podium was Ravindra Shankar Ganiger. With 100-plus patents, Ganiger has one of the richest hauls of all scientists and engineers at the Bengaluru center. The team’s intellectual inputs, already at the heart of newer jet engines like GE9X, is crucial to Culp’s vision of “defining the future of flight.” GE woke up to India’s potential early. Others are doing it now. Nearly 1,600 multinationals have set up captive units, employing 1.7 million highly educated professionals. With a determined effort to lift the quantity and quality of the 2.5 million-plus graduates and Ph.Ds India mints annually in science, technology, engineering and medicine, it can conceivably expand its relevant talent pool. A little less red tape — and some improvement in civic amenities and quality of life in fast-growing cities like Bengaluru — will keep more of them at home with good jobs. Suppose each of these highly paid individuals supports three other Indians — and not just as their chauffeurs and housemaids. By generating tax resources for publicly funded employment in urban infrastructure, the narrow top of the employment pyramid would start filling its own middle. Stronger mass consumption will create demand for locally manufactured factory goods. The engineering that has gone into the 360 Foam Wash shows the way forward for adding value through research. Vidya Venkataramani and her team wanted to test a portable washer that could chemically clean jet engines between flights. To simulate the actual condition faced by planes over Middle Eastern routes, the Ph.D chemical engineer created her own dust in the lab. The washing machine for jet engines is already in commercial use, saving global airlines thousands of gallons of fuel every year. Sanjeev Jha, a mechanical engineer who joined the Bengaluru center around the same time as Nanda, uses sophisticated machine-learning models to predict the maintenance schedule so carriers get the most out of their engines. That, in turn, requires a trove of data so vast that each physical engine ends up with its digital twin. Even the probes for collecting standardized pictures that can be analysed by artificial intelligence are award-winning products designed in Bengaluru. In September 2000, GE’s then-boss Jack Welch came to India to open the Bengaluru center now named after him. I was among the reporters present. At the time, the global behemoth had 12,000 employees in a market that barely generated $1 billion in sales, not even 1 per cent of its global revenue. “Market growth will come,” he told us. “The real opportunity in India is its incredibly skilled workforce. We have used the software generated by our India business to change the company. That's great.” In the past 25 years, the appeal of India’s talent has transformed — from streamlining internal processes to being harnessed in hardware sold to external customers. One idea for GE’s upcoming engine platform is a hybrid-powered jet: A Toyota Prius of the skies that could deliver thrust at high altitudes and temperatures — without the electronics becoming so bulky as to be unviable. Electrical engineer Suma MN is trying to crack that puzzle. I asked Suma if she is the first woman Ph.D from her village in Kerala, on India’s southeastern coast. “I’m the first human,” she corrected me. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Remember the slogan from 2014 – “minimum government, maximum governance”? Well, a decade later, “minimum governance” has won the day. In 2016, the introduction of the “one country, one examination, one merit system” through the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) was billed as a major governance reform in medical education. In 2017, this was complemented by the establishment of the National testing Agency (NTA), tasked with implementing all entrance exams -- NEET/JEE/NET/CUET, and several other acronym-based entrance exams that terrorise our young. The objective was to streamline processes and improve standards. However, as the stream of controversies from paper leaks to corruption, non-transparent marking, poorly designed questions and exam cancellations amply demonstrate, both reforms stand discredited. “Governance” is defined as the ability to effectively implement policy. Turns out the government insists on conducting exams --maximum government -- but does so with minimum governance. Characteristically, the Prime Minister has maintained a studied silence, even as he posted Yoga Day selfies with Srinagar’s young. And now, the CBI has come in to investigate – minimum governance, of course! That said, this shameful affair, is symptomatic of deeper challenges that plague “governance” today. This is not confined to higher education, nor did they begin in 2014, but the NEET/NTA controversy illustrates the problem well. Getting to the holy grail of “maximum governance” requires confronting these realities. In 2024, close to 24 lakh students took the NEET-UG exam to fill 1 lakh MBBS seats across the country. An estimated 14 lakh students appeared for the JEE mains. Of these, 2.5 lakh make to the JEE advanced to compete for about 59,937 (as of 2023) seats in the country’s premier engineering colleges. This staggering demand-supply gap is a result of decades of neglected investment. We simply do not have enough colleges, and certainly very few of quality, to cope with the growing numbers of high school graduates with big dreams. Scarcity intensifies competition beyond repair. After all, the stakes are just too high. This is one reason for the proliferation of coaching classes. But when scarcity exists alongside a broken school system, one that routinely produces shoddy learning, a toxic cheating mafia, to respond to the competition, is almost inevitable. Rather than address this fundamental scarcity and quality gap, policymakers searched for “governance” solutions. And in doing so gave in to the urge to “centralise”, the one size-fits-all solution to all governance problems in India. In an important column, former Union Health Secretary Sujatha Rao set out the context in which the NEET was considered back in 2010 -- poor education standards, the need to reduce multiplicity of exams, and to curb corruption and the practice of high capitation fees charged by private colleges. Centralising examinations into NEET was considered the silver bullet that would lead to better examination standards and thus improve the quality of student intake while ensuring fairness through competition and administrative efficiency (policymakers in India routinely and wrongly conflate centralisation with efficiency) and curb corruption. But this was the wrong solution. Not only did it fail to address the roots of the problem, it stripped medical colleges of their autonomy, and states of their ability to find locally relevant ways of responding to the quality and corruption challenge. In 2016, the courts dismissed the autonomy question but some solutions need to go beyond legalism. Any educationist will tell you that undermining autonomy in admissions is exactly the route to curbing innovation and experimentation, critical components of what ensures quality higher education. Regulation to ensure standards is necessary but it has to balance autonomy considerations. The logic of centralisation in NEET has now been applied to the UGC-NET exam and CUET, governing research and undergraduate admissions, further entrenching the problem. Beyond institutional autonomy, Tamil Nadu’s repeated objections to NEET have further highlighted the absurdity (besides its lack of constitutionality) of finding centralised solutions to governance challenges in a diverse country. NEET has undermined TN’s perfectly functional policy of medical college admissions linked to school examination scores, creating in its wake an admissions process that biases against rural and poorer students who study in the state board and favours those who can afford coaching classes (99% successful candidates in 2020). What is necessary for Bihar does not apply to Tamil Nadu, and vice versa. But what is equally important is, with notable exceptions like Tamil Nadu, most states have failed to raise any concerns about this kind of centralisation, even as their students suffer. The worst peril of centralisation is that it allows governments at all levels to abdicate responsibility and pass the buck. In the end, behemoths like the NTA simply cannot implement a complex task like multiple entrance exams that requires combining local knowledge with specialised pedagogical skills. It is instructive that these issues were raised by educationists when the idea of the NTA was mooted in 2013 by the then UPA government, but no policymaker chose to take heed. And in 2017, in the rush to set up the NTA and make a headline splash, no consideration was given even to basic human resource issues -- what kind of qualifications, experience, capacity is needed to design and conduct such complex exams? The NTAs incompetence would be laughable if its consequences were not so tragic. Ultimately, “maximum governance” requires deliberative, rational, cooperative, decision-making and open government. It requires careful engagement with root causes rather than succumbing to the temptation to centralise. This is exactly what our policymaking ecosystem, especially the administrative culture promoted by Modi, has no patience for. Thus, we are condemned to live with the national shame of paper leaks. But for the ray of hope that our brave students who’ve taken to the streets, fighting for their rights, have given us. Democracy is still alive and may be, there is hope yet. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Beijing: Hundreds of yoga enthusiasts across China spread their mats on Saturday to showcase their passion and skills in the ancient Indian physical and spiritual practice on the 10th International Day of Yoga, despite the chill in bilateral ties since the 2020 military standoff in eastern Ladakh. Year after year, the number of yoga practitioners participating in the official and unofficial events on International Yoga Day in different cities is growing, especially the young people, officials say. Over 1,000 yoga enthusiasts participated in a two-hour-long programme held by the Indian Embassy in Beijing on Saturday. The event was held a day after the US International Yoga Day to coincide with the weekend holiday. Indian Ambassador to China Pradeep Kumar Rawat, his wife Shruti Rawat, and Deputy Ambassador Abhishek Shukla besides the officials of the embassy joined the multitude of yoga practitioners at the special event held at the old embassy premises. The event had many different aspects of the health and wellness traditions of India. While Master Lokesh Sharma, a teacher of Indian culture from the embassy, led the common yoga protocol, there were also special sessions on meditation by renowned professor Dr R S Bhogal, a meditation expert from Kaivalyadhama Yoga Institute in Pune. The event was held in collaboration with four institutes — YogiYoga, We Yoga, Om Shiva Yoga and Hemanth Yoga. The session also had challenges for the participants as enthusiasts tried their hands at the ‘Ashtavakrasana’ (eight angle pose) and the winner was awarded at the end of the event, T S Vivekanand, First Secretary of the Indian Embassy in-charge of culture, told PTI . Participants enthusiastically engaged in the common yoga protocol, a standardised yoga practice that includes all aspects of yoga and is suitable for adoption by all age groups, he said. A session on advanced yoga and a yoga challenge was also organised for regular practitioners of yoga, Vivekanand said. The event included a soulful kirtan performance by N K Singh and a captivating kathak performance by Sohini Karanth, integrating the elements of yoga and meditation. Huge yoga events were also held by the Indian Consulates in Shanghai and Guangzhou besides the eastern city of Yiwu, the global commodity market where hundreds of Indian businessmen reside, engaging in the export of billions of dollars of Chinese products to India. Vivekanand said there is more traction from the Chinese participants in yoga events held by the embassy. While over 270 people took part last year on International Yoga Day, this year nearly 1,000 took part in the event. Similarly, at the Vasant Mela event held by the embassy in March this year, over 4,500 people took part, highlighting the growing interest in Indian culture, food and yoga. The increase in numbers in the events despite the bilateral tensions over the eastern Ladakh standoff in the last four years is seen as an encouraging sign by the officials. For their part, veteran yoga teachers in China say that there is a qualitative difference in the popularity of yoga in China compared to other countries. The unique feature of yoga culture in China is its popularity among young people in the age group of 20-25 years, Mohan Bhandari, Director of Research at YogiYoga Institute, said. Young people are taking part in yoga in large numbers compared to other countries where many people begin to take an interest in the Indian physical and spiritual practice after 30 years of age and beyond. Bhandari, who hails from Rishikesh in India, founded the YogiYoga Institute several years ago with his Chinese wife Yin Yan. The institute has centres in several Chinese cities and runs training programmes, including yoga healing. Already those young people who took to yoga are introducing the practice to their children in China as a result the next generation of yoga teachers will come from China, Bhandari told PTI . Yin Yan, who is the founder president of YogiYoga, says yoga will continue to develop in China because of the needs of the people and its increasing popularity in social life, workplace and the family. However, despite its growing popularity yoga institutes suffered major reverses during the COVID outbreak as hundreds of them have shut down. This also rendered scores of Indian yoga teachers working in China to return to India. Bhandari says the yoga industry in China is on a slow recovery and the enthusiasm of Chinese people will continue to help its growth. #Elections2024"

PETA said, in a statement, that the mechanical elephant, named Baladhasan, was donated to the temple in recognition of its decision to never own or hire live pachyderms for ceremonies and festivals. The mechanical elephant, the third one to be introduced in a Kerala temple, is around three meters tall and weighs around 800 kilograms, PETA said. Speaking on the occasion, Sharma said, \"Technological progress allows us to preserve our deep cultural traditions and heritage while allowing elephants, who are endangered, to live with their families in the jungle. \"I am delighted to contribute this mechanical elephant with PETA India, enabling followers to participate in sacred rituals in a manner that is both safe for humans and respectful of animals.\" Pournamikavu Temple's Mukya Karyadarshi M S Bhuvanachandran welcomed the donation and is quoted as having said, \"On this auspicious Pournami day, we are delighted to have mechanical elephant Baladhasan with us in honour of all the divine creatures who yearn to roam the earth free and secure with their loved ones.\" PETA India in its statement further said that according to figures compiled by the Heritage Animal Task Force, captive elephants killed 526 people in Kerala in a 15-year period. Baladhasan will perform in all temple ceremonies, allowing real elephants to stay with their families in the jungle homes, where they belong. 🐘🐘🐘 @adah_sharma #Pournamikavu #MechanicalElephant #RoboticBaladhasan pic.twitter.com/0dxXP65oGd It further said that two life-size mechanical elephants are already in use in Kerala temples through PETA India’s efforts in recognition of temples’ decisions never to own or hire live elephants. \"They include Irinjadappilly Raman at the Irinjadappilly Sree Krishna Temple in Thrissur and Mahadevan at the Thrikkayil Mahadeva Temple in Kochi,\" it said. \"PETA India encourages all venues and events using real elephants to switch to lifelike mechanical elephants or other means in place of live animals. \"PETA India advocates for elephants already in captivity to be retired to sanctuaries where they could live unchained and in the company of other elephants, healing psychologically and physically from the trauma of years of isolation, captivity, and abuse,\" it said in its statement. #Elections2024"

SGPC chief Harjinder Singh Dhami said a complaint has been sent to the police commissioner for taking action against Makwana. \"No one can be allowed to act against Sikh conduct at the Golden Temple but some people deliberately ignore the sanctity and historical importance of this holy place and commit objectionable acts,\" he said in a statement. \"Sikh sentiments and 'maryada (conduct)' have been hurt by the act, so a complaint has been filed with the police,\" he said. In an appeal, Dhami said Harmandir Sahib has great reverence in the Sikh world and pilgrims from every religion and class come there to pay obeisance. Considering that, the 'maryada' of the place should be followed. Darbar Sahib general manager Bhagwant Singh Dhangera said the woman's action hurt the sentiments of Sikhs and the 'sangat'. Later, in a story posted on her Instagram handle, Makwana apologised for her conduct and said, \"I posted something without intending to harm anyone's religious sentiments. I was unaware that practising yoga in the Gurdwara Sahib premises could be offensive to some as I was just paying my respect to him and did not mean any harm to anyone.\" \"I sincerely apologise for any hurt I may have caused and promise to be more mindful in the future. Please accept my sincere apologies,\" she said. #Elections2024"

Portugal captain Ronaldo posed for a selfie with a young boy with around 20 minutes left to play, but five others later made it on to the pitch in an apparent attempt to take a picture with a visibly unhappy Ronaldo. Man of the match Bernardo Silva brushed off the incidents, saying it was \"the price we pay for being so recognised in the world of football and having a player like him (Ronaldo) with us\". Martinez, however, said the pitch invasions left the players exposed and should have been prevented by security staff. \"It's a concern because today we were lucky that the intentions of the fans were good,\" he told reporters. \"I think we all love a fan that recognises that big star and the big icons ... but you can understand that there is a very, very difficult moment if those intentions are wrong.\" #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: India's second richest person Gautam Adani received a total remuneration of Rs 9.26 crore in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, lower than most industry peers as well as his own key executives. Adani, 61, drew salary from only two out of the 10 companies in his ports-to-energy conglomerate, annual reports of the 10 listed entities of the group showed. His remuneration for 2023-24 from the group's flagship firm Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) included Rs 2.19 crore salary and perquisites, allowances and other benefits worth Rs 27 lakh. The total remuneration of Rs 2.46 crore was 3 per cent more than the previous financial year, according to AEL's 2023-24 annual report. Besides, he drew Rs 6.8 crore from Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd (APSEZ). Adani's salary is lower than heads of almost all large family-owned conglomerates in India. While the richest Indian, Mukesh Ambani has been foregoing his entire salary since Covid-19 broke out prior to which he had capped his remuneration at Rs 15 crore, Adani's remuneration is much lower than telecom czar Sunil Bharti Mittal (Rs 16.7 crore in 2022-23), Rajiv Bajaj (Rs 53.7 crore), Pawan Munjal (Rs 80 crore), L&T Chairman S N Subrahmanyan and Infosys CEO Salil S Parekh. Adani, who is worth $106 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index , has been jostling with Ambani for the spot of the richest person in Asia. He became the richest Asian in 2022 but lost that position after a damning report by US short-seller Hindenburg Research wiped out almost USD 150 billion of market value of his group stock at its lowest point last year. He regained the top spot on two occasions this year but again ceded the position to Ambani. Ambani is ranked 12th on the world's richest list with a networth of $111 billion. Adani is ranked 14th. Adani's younger brother Rajesh got Rs 8.37 crore, including Rs 4.71 crore commission on profit from AEL, while his nephew Pranav Adani drew Rs 6.46 crore, including Rs 4.5 crore commission, the annual report showed. Gautam Adani did not draw any commission from AEL but got Rs 5 crore from APSEZ. The remuneration from APSEZ included Rs 1.8 crore salary and Rs 5 crore commission that will be payable in 2024-25 fiscal, the company's annual report said. His son, Karan earned Rs 3.9 crore from APSEZ. Gautam Adani's brother, nephew and son did not draw salaries from more than one company. Vinay Prakash, key executive and director on AEL board, received a total remuneration of Rs 89.37 crore. Group CFO Jugeshinder Singh got Rs 9.45 crore salary. The group's renewable energy firm, Adani Green Energy Ltd CEO Vneet S Jaain was paid Rs 15.25 crore while Adani Total Gas Ltd (ATGL) CEO Suresh P Manglani earned Rs 6.88 crore. Adani Wilmar CEO Angshu Mallick got Rs 5.15 crore. \"We reported an average remuneration increase of 12 per cent for employees, excluding key managerial personnel (KMPs), with a slightly higher increase of 5.37 per cent for KMPs,\" the AEL annual report said. S B Khyalia, CEO of Adani Power got Rs 5.63 crore. #Elections2024"

As per a report by The Times Of India , The woman, Laurence Van Wassenhove, alleged that the company where she was an employee, 'shelved' her after she requested a transfer in 2002 due to her disability. She was reportedly hired by Orange's predecessor, France Telecom, in 1993. Wassenhove is partially paralysed and has epilepsy. Before the transfer, Wassenhove used to hold roles according to her suitability like secretary and working in human resources. As per her lawyer, her transfer was approved but the new place was not adapted for her needs, instead offering her alternatives, reportedly, Orange stopped giving her any work or tasks. The lawyer argued that the company failed to provide Wassenhove an accommodation, considering her disability which forced her to states of professional limbo. While the company has denied any discrimination and claimed to consider Wassenhove's medical condition and explored options for her to return to work in an adapted position. The company also said that her regular sick leaves made them difficult to act upon this. On the other hand, Wassenhove kept accepting the compensation for two decades and claimed she faced \"moral harassment\" due to the situation the company allegedly put her into and that being paid without any work tasks isolated her. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Srinagar: Kashmir, renowned for its stunning natural beauty, has always been a popular tourist destination. Since the abrogation of Article 370, the region has experienced a significant surge in visitors. However, this influx, coupled with unregulated tourism, is straining its fragile ecosystem. Tourism, a key component of Kashmir's economy, has revitalized the hospitality and service sectors. Yet, this boom is putting immense pressure on natural resources, resulting in overproduction of sewage, litter, loss of animal habitats, deforestation, and various forms of pollution. Heaps of plastic waste are now common in popular tourist spots like Gulmarg, Pahalgam, Sonamarg, Yusmarg, and Doodhpathri. Pilgrims visiting the Amarnath cave shrine are littering the high-altitude mountains, where waste decomposition is slow due to freezing temperatures. The cave is near the Kolahoi glacier, which feeds the Lidder and Sindh rivulets, tributaries of the Jhelum River, Kashmir’s lifeline. Rapid tourism growth has also led to numerous infrastructure projects, often at the expense of the environment and without adequate consultation with local communities. While these developments boost the economy, they risk damaging the very assets that make Kashmir unique. Experts advocate for sustainable tourism to protect the environment and enhance Kashmir’s appeal. “A comprehensive plan balancing the needs of the environment, the community, and tourists is essential,\" a researcher at the University of Kashmir told DH . He recommended eco-friendly accommodations, effective waste management systems, and educational programs on conservation for both locals and visitors. The surge in tourist numbers has increased pollution in the region's lakes and rivers, threatening the delicate alpine ecosystem, local biodiversity, and natural habitats. Abdul Majeed, a hotelier at Gulmarg ski resort, warned, “We cannot continue like this. If we do not act now, our paradise will be lost forever. We must embrace sustainable tourism.” J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha recently stated the administration is promoting sustainable tourism with the aim of ensuring a zero-waste during the upcoming Amarnathji Yatra. “J&K is leading the way in promoting sustainable tourism. For this holy yatra, we have implemented solutions through a fusion of technology and human resources,” he said. “We must focus on environmentally friendly waste disposal, piped water and power connections, lighting, and necessary facilities at all toilets.” #Elections2024"

Ram Sumer (60), a resident of Bansgaon in Gorakhpur, lodged a complaint that his wife Phoolmati had gone missing on June 15. Four days later, on June 19, a woman's body was found in the Uruva Bazaar area. Sumer identified the body as that of his wife and completed the last rites, the police said. However, the case took a mysterious turn after her post-mortem revealed that the woman had been strangled to death, prompting a further probe, they added. To nab the suspected killer, the police traced Phoolmati's mobile phone, which was found active about 600 kilometres away in Jhansi. Call records showed frequent communication between Phoolmati and a number belonging to one Shubham from Sultanpur. When questioned, Shubham told the police that Phoolmati was alive and he had brought her to Jhansi. The police subsequently located her at the address provided by Shubham. Sumer told the police that Phoolmati had left her paternal home on June 15 to return to his house but never arrived. After extensive searches, he reported her missing. Superintendent of Police (South) Jitendra Kumar Tomar said the woman was sent back to her husband on Saturday after her statement was recorded. An investigation is underway to determine the connection among Sumer, Phoolmati, Shubham, and the dead woman who was cremated. The police have also obtained CCTV camera footage showing a boy moving suspiciously and are re-investigating the case from a new angle, he said. #Elections2024"

It was found at a depth of 2.25 metres when a team of experts, during the conservation work of Lakhuji Jadhavrao's Chhatri, spotted some stone alignments and then reached a temple base on further digging, Superintendent Archaeologist of Nagpur Circle Arun Malik told PTI . \"After the sabha mandap was exposed, we decided to check the depth of the temple, during which we found a sculpture of goddess Laxmi. Later, a huge sculpture of Sheshshayi Vishnu in its entirety was revealed. It is 1.70 metres in length and 1 metre in height. The width of the sculpture's base, which is yet to be exposed, may be 30 centimetres,\" Malik informed. \"It is made up of a chlorite schist rock. Such sculptures were carved in south India (Hoysalas). It is of Vishnu reclining on Shesha Naga and goddess Laxmi massaging his feet while sitting on a cushion. Samudramanthana is depicted in this sculpture and jewels of Samudramanthana like Ashwa, Airavat are also seen on the panel,\" he said. The detailed and meticulously carved panel showing Dashavatara, Samudramanthana and Lord Vishnu reclining is the peculiarity of this sculpture, he added. Iconography expert Saili Palande-Datar said the rock is schist stone, which is soft as compared to locally found basalt rock. \"Such sculptures were found in Marathwada earlier but they were in basalt rock. The sculpture of the donor couple (between Sheshnaag and Samudramanthan) is also carved prominently on this panel, which is its peculiarity. In the future, when an art museum is established in Maharashtra, this sculpture will be one of its masterpieces,\" she said. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi/Patna: The CBI on Sunday took over the probe into alleged irregularities in the medical entrance exam NEET-UG following a reference from the Union education ministry, while the Economic Offences Unit of the Bihar Police arrested five more persons for alleged paper leak, taking the total arrests to 18. With the investigation gathering steam, the National Testing Agency (NTA) cracked the whip against more students, debarring 17 from centres in Bihar after detection of \"malpractices\". Amid a demand for the cancellation of the May 5 exam, the ministry officials reiterated the government's earlier stand that the incidents of malpractices were \"localised\" or \"isolated\" and it was not fair to jeopardise the careers of lakhs of candidates who cleared the exam rightfully. In an optional retest held for 1,563 students whose grace marks were scrapped after the matter reached the Supreme Court, only 813 appeared on Sunday. These candidates were awarded grace marks by the NTA to make up for the loss of time at six centres due to a delay in the start of the examination on May 5. There were allegations that it led to inflation of marks and contributed to six of the grace mark candidates from the same centre in Haryana scoring a perfect 720 marks along with 61 others. Over 13 lakh candidates out of around 24 lakh qualified in the NEET-UG this year and they will compete for around 1.8 lakh MBBS/dental seats. In the backdrop of allegations of irregularities as well as \"bunching of high scorers\", the NTA stated that the top one lakh candidates are spread across 4,500 centres all over the country. Moreover, nearly two-thirds of these are from rural or semi-rural areas, it stated. As countrywide protests and litigation continued, the CBI filed the FIR in connection with alleged irregularities in NEET-UG under IPC sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating) among others. The Bihar Police's EOU had handed over a report to the Education Ministry on Saturday following which the probe was handed over to CBI for comprehensive investigation. In a statement issued in Patna late Sunday evening, the EOU said the five arrested persons were detained from Deoghar in Jharkhand on Saturday. They were identified as Baldev Kumar, Mukesh Kumar, Panku Kumar, Rajeev Kumar and Paramjeet Singh. All are originally residents of Nalanda. Baldev Kumar, associated with the notorious Sanjeev Kumar alias Lutan Mukhiya gang, allegedly received the solved answer sheet of the NEET-UG exam in PDF format on his mobile phone a day before the exam, the statement said. The statement claimed the members of the Mukhiya gang, accused of orchestrating multiple interstate paper leaks, were the source of the leaked answer sheet. Further investigation revealed that Baldev and his associates printed and distributed the solved answer sheet to students gathered at a safe house in Ram Krishna Nagar in Patna on May 4 for memorisation. The aspirants were brought there by two previously arrested persons, Nitish Kumar and Amit Anand. According to the statement, the leaked NEET-UG question paper was allegedly obtained from a private school in Hazaribagh, Jharkhand, by the Mukhiya gang. Investigators matched a partially burnt question paper recovered from the Patna safe house with the reference question paper provided by the National Testing Agency (NTA), confirming the leak's origin, it said. Standard procedures for handling and transporting question papers, as set by the NTA, were also allegedly disregarded by those involved in the breach, it claimed The EOU interrogated several persons linked to the custody chain of the question papers, including bank officials and employees of a courier company. A manhunt is on to nab Mukhiya and his other gang members, it said. \"The NTA also provided roll code of 15 aspirants during the course of investigation for their detailed examination. While four have been examined, the remaining 11 have not turned up before the investigators for their examination,\" it said. Now the case is being handed over to the CBI for further investigation, it added. The EOU had last month arrested 13 people in connection with the case. \"Based on the inputs received 17 candidates who appeared from centres in Bihar were debarred. This takes the number of total candidates debarred from the exam this year to 110,\" an NTA official said. The agency had earlier debarred 63 candidates for adopting unfair means in the exam. On Saturday, 30 additional candidates from Gujarat's Godhara were also debarred. Officials said the ministry alleged in a complaint, now part of the FIR, to the CBI that \"certain isolated incidents\" occurred in a few states during the conduct of the examination. \"The ministry of education has requested the CBI to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the entire gamut of alleged irregularities, including conspiracy, cheating, impersonation, breach of trust and destruction of evidence by candidates, institutes and middlemen,\" a CBI spokesperson said. The role of public servants, if any, connected with the conduct of the examination and also into the entire gamut of events, and the larger conspiracy will also be under the scanner, according to the officials. Meanwile, the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) questioned two teachers who run a private coaching centre in Latur district in connection with the alleged irregularities. The Centre had on Saturday night removed NTA DG Subodh Kumar Singh and put him on \"compulsory wait\" till further orders. The opposition stepped up its attack on the government over the issue, with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Sunday demanding Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan's resignation. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said the buck stops at the doorstep of the top echelons of the Modi Government and shuffling the bureaucrats is no solution. Party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra alleged the Modi government has handed over the entire education system to the \"mafia\" and the \"corrupt\" after the Centre cancelled UGC-NET and postponed NEET-PG and CSIR-UGC-NET. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin said the cancellation of exams was not a one-off event \"but the final nails in the coffin of an incompetent and broken system of centralised selection\". The BJP, however, asserted the government has taken on the NEET issue \"head on\". \"It notified the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024, appointed a high powered committee to look at streamlining exam process and eliminating lose ends, sacks NTA DG, orders CBI probe in NEET (UG), besides postponing several exams, preempting possible compromises, to safeguard student interest,\" BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya said. He alleged that the Congress' ally RJD was linked to the paper leak in Bihar and its leaders should not use the issue for their \"dirty politics\". The Union education ministry's high-level panel for suggesting exam reforms and reviewing functioning of the National Testing Agency will meet on Monday, sources said. The ministry had on Saturday notified the seven-member panel headed by former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chief K Radhakrishnan to ensure transparent, smooth and fair conduct of examinations through the NTA. On Sunday, the NTA also clarified that its website and all its other web portals are fully secure, and reports that these have been compromised and hacked are wrong and misleading. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Pune: Eight people have been arrested and four police personnel suspended after a bar in Pune was found operating beyond permissible time limit, an official said on Monday. Police had launched a probe after a viral video purportedly showed some persons with a drug-like substance at the bar located on Fergusson College Road in Maharashtra 's Pune city. According to police, the bar was operating till 5 am on Sunday and liquor was being sold beyond the permissible time limit. Bars and pubs in Pune are allowed to remain open till 1.30 am. \"We have arrested eight persons, including owners and employees of the Liquid Leisure Lounge (L3) after it came to light that the establishment was operating beyond the permissible time limit on Sunday,\" Pune Commissioner of Police Amitesh Kumar told PTI . Those arrested have been booked under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and relevant provisions of the Maharashtra Police Act, Maharashtra Prohibition Act, and the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, he said. An inspector, an assistant inspector and two beat marshals from the Shivajinagar police station, who were on night duty, have been suspended in connection with the case, the official said. Asked about the video showing some persons with a drug-like substance at the bar, another police official said they were looking into it. Pune MP and Union minister Murlidhar Mohol in a post on X said though the action of suspension has been taken immediately, the police commissioner has also been instructed to launch a dedicated drive against narcotics and depute a separate manpower for it. ‘त्या’ व्हायरल व्हिडिओ प्रकरणी शिवाजीनगरचे पोलीस निरिक्षक निलंबित… पुण्यातील अमली पदार्थ सेवन करतानाच्या व्हायरल व्हिडिओ प्रकरणी आपल्या सूचनेनंतर मोठी कारवाई करण्यात आली असून ज्या हद्दीतील हा प्रकार आहे, त्या शिवाजीनगर पोलीस ठाण्याचे गुन्हे पोलीस निरिक्षक, सहायक पोलीस निरिक्षक… \"All colleges, pubs, hotels and other suspicious places should be searched with strict action.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Mumbai: Child Rights and You (CRY), one of the leading child rights organisations working with Indian children along with its many grassroots-level partner organisations spread across 20 intervention states, announced the launch of Poori Padhai Desh Ki Bhalai – a pan-India awareness campaign to raise public awareness and change societal attitudes towards girls education. The seven-week-long campaign was launched on Monday (June 24) in five metro -- Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai and Kolkata -- and aims to engage all its stakeholders to address gender disparities in education. The campaign will come to a close on August 15, the Independence Day of India. As part of the campaign, CRY and its partner organisations will aim to increase the number of enrolment and retention of girls in primary, upper-primary, secondary & higher secondary education in its operational areas; and will strive to create widespread awareness by engaging with all relevant stakeholders including children and their families, educators, community members, state administrative authorities, students at schools, colleges and universities, media houses, social media influencers, corporates, HNIs, and the people at large. Highlighting the importance of the campaign, CRY CEO Puja Marwah said, “Ensuring higher secondary education for girls is a non-negotiable for their empowerment and the nation’s development. Targeted interventions with specific goals and action points are needed to support girls beyond elementary education. This includes adequate public provisioning for girls’ education, financial incentives, improved infrastructure, community engagement, and robust enforcement of laws against child marriage. But none of these are possible without generating a mass awareness and a social resonance around girls’ education.” Underscoring the positive impacts of girls’ secondary education on child marriage, she said, “Providing higher secondary education for girls has a strong correlation with delayed marriage for girls, improved health outcomes for the mother and the child, and offers high economic returns in the long term. Furthermore, each additional year of schooling leads to higher productivity and better job opportunities in the formal sector for girls, thus breaking the cycle of inter-generational poverty.” Kreeanne Rabadi, Regional Director, CRY-West says that through this campaign CRY hopes to achieve its objective of further reducing the dropout rate specially in adolescent girls. “CRY has a number of programmes across Maharashtra, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh actively working towards ensuring girls complete their education. We've seen that the longer the girls stay in school, the more empowered they become to participate in decisions that most affect them, and they can build better futures for themselves, their families and their communities. Through this campaign, we hope to prevent many more girls from dropping out of school. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has taken its syllabus censorship further and introduced more falsehoods, misrepresentations and evasions in textbooks. It had started the process of rewriting history, reinventing historical personages, and reinterpreting society ever since the BJP came to power. The latest erasures and revisions are as striking as they are lopsided. All mention of the Gujarat riots and the violence after the Babri Masjid demolition have been omitted from the Class 12 political science textbook on the ground that an “expert committee felt that mentioning a few riots selectively is not good”. NCERT Chairman Dinesh Saklani thinks that students should not be taught about riots because “we want to create positive citizens, not violent and depressed individuals”. Shall we forget the Partition riots, too, then, and shall we keep all strife and unrest in history out of textbooks in the interest of creating ‘positive’ citizens out of students? The idea is to whitewash history and to present a picture of India and the world, past and present, as the BJP wishes to look at them, and not as they actually happened. The book does not mention the Babri Masjid by name, but calls it a “three-domed structure”. The section on the rath yatra, the role of kar sevaks in demolishing the Babri Masjid, and the communal violence that followed are not mentioned. References to the dismissal of BJP governments after the demolition and the party’s “regret over the happenings in Ayodhya” have been removed. Textbooks have been revised in the past in various other ways, too. Ideas like the Aryan migration and historical events like the Islamic rule, including the centuries-long Mughal period, and Gandhi’s assassination have been presented to suit the BJP’s narrative. All the Mughals were oppressors and all Hindu kings were benign. Ancient India was golden and led the world in all fields. It is a distorted and unreal picture of India that is presented to the children. This happens when history is made to serve today’s politics and education is used as a tool to indoctrinate young minds. The New Education Policy 2020 aims to “enhance critical thinking among students” and the NCERT is expected to be an autonomous body, not an ideological affiliate of the BJP. A nation is its history, including past and contemporary history, and the values that guided it in the past and will guide it in the future. If a false idea of the nation is instilled in the minds of students, they will construct their own self-images accordingly and develop a false and unreal worldview around it. Education should promote them to question and to argue. It should not hide, distort and falsify history and it should not impose answers and conclusions on them. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Mining-ravaged Sandur in Karnataka’s Ballari district may be staring at an environmental catastrophe with the Centre approving the felling of 99,000 trees spread over nearly 1,000 acres. Sandur, which bore the brunt of illegal mining for over a decade, has already lost much of its greenery. The pollution caused by mining has also led to serious health hazards. The project proposed by the Kudremukh Iron Ore Company (KIOCL) was recently approved by Union Heavy Industries and Steel Minister H D Kumaraswamy. Between June 2019 and February 2020, the proposal to mine iron and manganese ore was rejected by the Forest Department at four levels, starting from the Deputy Conservator of Forests to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF). In fact, the then PCCF Punati Sridhar wrote to the government in August 2019 that forest areas should not be considered for mining purpose till a detailed exercise was undertaken in the state to map the mineral resources within and outside forest areas and that exploitation of minerals outside forest areas should be prioritised. However, the Forest Department’s objections were overruled by the state government, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, and now by Kumaraswamy. Curiously, the approval was granted even as a case against the project is pending before the Karnataka High Court. The court had ruled that any further steps taken by the government on the project would be subject to the final outcome of the case. As it is, both India and Karnataka have been found lacking on the environmental front. India remains one of the worst five in an environmental performance index of 180 nations prepared by two leading US institutions. According to the study by Yale and Columbia University researchers, India fared poorly on parameters like ecosystem vitality, biodiversity and habitat, species protection, terrestrial biome and air quality. While the National Forest Policy of India stipulates that at least 33per cent of the geographical area should be covered by forests, in Karnataka it stands at only 22 per cent, having declined 1per cent over the past decade. While it may be necessary to obtain natural resources for economic growth, the government should strike a balance between growth and protection of the environment. In this case, the government appears to have been solely guided by economic considerations, with no thought for the disastrous environmental consequences it will have. The government should first map the mineral resources in non-forest areas as recommended by the Forest Department and put the Sandur project on hold at least until the High Court disposes of the case. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The cancellation of the University Grants Commission-National Eligibility Test examination, conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) on Wednesday, soon after the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) (Undergraduate) exam was involved in controversies, raises serious questions about the examination system. Over nine lakh students appeared for the UGC-NET exam, and about 2.4 million took the NEET-UG test. While scrapping the NET exam, the Union government announced that the “integrity of the examination may have been compromised’’ and that it would hand over the matter to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). This is an admission by the government that unfair means were employed in the examination, though it is yet to clarify the nature of the unfair means, and who employed them. While the NEET exam is held for admission to medical and related courses, the NET exam is held for appointment in universities for positions such as assistant professors and junior research fellows. The controversies surrounding the exams, which point to grave faults, have dented the NTA’s credibility. The issues related to the NEET-UG exam are in the Supreme Court, which has criticised the NTA and posed some hard questions to it. The government told the court that the grace marks awarded to more than 1,500 students in the NEET exam would be revoked, and they could appear for a fresh exam. There are charges about the question paper being leaked and abnormalities like too many top rankers. Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said that “some irregularities in NEET have come to light from specific locations”. There have been serious complaints about the NEET exam in the past few years. Instead of gaining experience from previous years and rectifying mistakes, the NTA has been committing more serious mistakes every year. Students spend a lot of time, energy, effort, and money to prepare for these examinations. It is wrong to make them reappear for the same examination and undergo mental trauma and face uncertainty. It should be possible for the NTA or any other agency to conduct a flawless examination when the best technologies are available. Though Pradhan has promised that those responsible for the mistakes and the crisis would be punished, no one has yet been held accountable. Opposition parties have demanded that the NEET exam be cancelled and the minister tender his resignation. It has also sought an investigation monitored by the Supreme Court. After so many mistakes affecting the lives of tens of thousands of students, the position of the NTA leadership has become untenable. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : There is rising concern over the deficiency in rainfall and the slow progress of the monsoon ever since it arrived in the subcontinent about three weeks ago. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the country has received 20 per cent less rainfall since the start of the monsoon on June 1, and it has not made any significant progress between June 12 and 18. Its progress seems to have stalled in Maharashtra. Though the southern peninsula got above-normal rainfall, other parts of India have seen a 15-70 per cent shortfall. Even in the south, there are many areas, including parts of North Karnataka, that have received less-than-normal rainfall. The IMD has suggested that the rainfall could be below normal in June. June and July are important months for agriculture because most of the sowing for the kharif crop takes place then. The situation should cause concern, though there is no need for alarm yet. Agriculture across large parts of India depends on the monsoon rains. The impact of a deficient or delayed monsoon will be immediately felt in many parts of central India, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, where irrigation is far from adequate. These areas substantially contribute to the country’s agricultural production as rice, wheat, sugarcane, and vegetables are widely cultivated there. They are experiencing temperatures between 42 and 46 degrees Celsius. The dry weather, heat wave conditions, and the lack of rain will impact agriculture and much more. Nearly half of India’s agricultural land is rain-dependent as it lacks irrigation infrastructure. Reservoirs are at their lowest levels. They have not seen levels rising much even in areas covered by the monsoon. Apart from irrigation, drinking water supply and power production will be affected by water shortage in the reservoirs. One major impact of a deficient monsoon will be on food prices. Last year’s below normal and wayward monsoon hurt food production and fuelled a hike in food prices. Food inflation, which has risen to high levels in recent months, still remains high at 7.9 per cent. Vegetable inflation has been very high at 27.3 per cent. Another scanty monsoon will send food inflation soaring, and the poorer sections will be hit the hardest. Governments will have to start planning for a deficient rainfall situation. The IMD is sticking to its forecast of a normal monsoon and eventually it may be proved right. But the weather is known to be fickle, we don’t understand it fully, and the climate is changing. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The hooch tragedy in which 47 people died in Kallakurichi in north Tamil Nadu over the last two days is among the worst such tragedies in recent times. There were two other illicit liquor disasters in the state in 2023 in which 17 people lost their lives. Last year’s tragedies took place after a gap of 15 years, during which no serious incidents occurred. So it was believed that Tamil Nadu had addressed the menace of illicit brewing and consumption with some degree of success. The laws had been amended to bring the supply and distribution of methanol, the cause of death when illicit liquor is consumed, under control. But the deaths in Kallakurichi show that the problem persists, and it may not have been noticed because luckily there were no deaths. Every hooch tragedy results from administrative failure, and the district and state administrations must be held responsible for them. Prohibition is extremely difficult to implement, but a safe and healthy liquor policy is not. In Tamil Nadu, liquor is sold through the retail outlets of the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Limited (Tasmac). When cheaper and stronger illicit liquor is sold, an alert police and administration are quick to sniff it out. The supply of methanol can also be tracked. Often, the nexus between brewers and bootleggers, and the police and other authorities, shields such crimes. There is also political patronage at the local level without which it is near impossible to carry out such nefarious activities. The district collector of Kallakurichi has been transferred and some police officials have been suspended or transferred. This amounts to closing the barn door after the horse has bolted. The district administration and the police, especially its prohibition enforcement wing, should be faulted for their failure to check illegal brewing and the sale of hooch. There was a failure in monitoring the supply of methanol. Tasmac’s decision to increase the price of liquor also forced many people to go in for cheaper and unsafe options. Some who had a direct role in the sale of hooch have been arrested, but the M K Stalin government must ensure that everyone responsible for this tragedy is punished. Undoubtedly, the sale of illegal liquor is prevalent in several parts of the state. Steps should be taken to stop that. Hooch victims are usually from the weaker sections of society. Whole families have been orphaned in Kallakurichi, and no amount of solatium can compensate for the trauma and the loss of family members. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The June 19 meeting between a United States bipartisan Congressional delegation and the Dalai Lama at Dharamsala was different in both form and substance. The seven-member delegation led by Republican Michael McCaul included former Speaker Nancy Pelosi — both hardliners on China. Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in 2022 contributed to the escalation of US-China tensions significantly. The Dharamsala visit came a week after the passage of the Resolve Tibet Act through the US Congress. The legislation now awaits presidential assent. Predictably, China, which denounced the legislation, came out strongly against the visit, describing the Dalai Lama as leading a “separatist” Tibetan group, and asking the US to desist from enacting the legislation. The Bill, whose language is stronger than the one in the Tibet Policy Act of 2002 and the Tibet Policy and Support Act of 2020, terms as “historically inaccurate” Beijing's assertion that Tibet was part of China from “ancient times”. It empowers the US State Department to “actively and directly” counter Chinese “disinformation” on Tibet. It also asks China to address Tibetan aspirations on their “unique language, religion and culture” through a negotiated agreement with the Dalai Lama or his representatives. In a public speech at Dharamsala, McCaul said the Bill makes it clear that Tibet has a right to self-determination. Significantly, China kept New Delhi out when it countered the US. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met the delegation, their talks centred on India-US ties. Both the US and India support the ‘One China Policy’, which refers to Beijing's position on Taiwan, but by extension claims legitimacy for its control of Tibet too. India's troubles with China are evident in its handling of both ‘Ts’. Since 2009, New Delhi has not reiterated the ‘One China Policy’ in official statements, conveying to Beijing that bilateral ties are a two-way street. Post-Doklam, when the Modi government actively sought to normalise ties with Beijing, India distanced itself visibly from the Dalai Lama. Only after China's aggressive push into Ladakh in 2020 did the government change course. Since 2021, Modi, who, unlike his predecessors, has not met the Dalai Lama, sent birthday wishes to the Tibetan leader on X. Both Taiwan President Lai Ching-Te and the Dalai Lama wished Modi on his third term in office. After sending New Delhi a sharp reminder about the One China Policy for Modi's acknowledgement of the felicitation from Taipei, Beijing too wished him, saying China stood ready to work with India “to look to the future and advance bilateral relations on a healthy and stable track”. For this, China must first show willingness to acknowledge and recommit itself to the long-standing border problems, including the new one that it precipitated in Ladakh four years ago. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The inaugural session of the 18th Lok Sabha might start on a jarring note after the appointment of the BJP’s Bhartruhari Mahtab as the pro tem Speaker, instead of the Congress party’s Kodikunnil Suresh. Suresh is the senior most member of the House as this is his eighth term as a member. Mahtab is in his seventh term. By convention, the senior most member is selected as the pro tem Speaker, whichever party the member belongs to. The pro tem Speaker presides over the House when members take oath and the Speaker’s election is held. It is a temporary position and the incumbent holds office usually for three days. The senior most member is called upon to preside over the House as a formality. No controversial decisions may have to be taken or rulings made by the pro tem Speaker till the House is fully constituted and the new Speaker assumes office. The government has produced a strange and unacceptable excuse for its decision by claiming that Mahtab has been a member for seven consecutive terms while Suresh’s tenure had interruptions. This is a self-serving argument because the idea behind the convention is that the member with the longest tenure in parliament should be the pro tem Speaker. Suresh has a longer tenure than Mahtab. The BJP had listed its then MP Maneka Gandhi for the position in 2019, even though she had had an interrupted tenure in the House. Eventually, Virender Kumar of the BJP got the position. But it is clear that the selection of Mahtab was a conscious decision. The message might be that the government is not willing to give any accommodation to the Opposition in the new Lok Sabha, though the Opposition has a greater presence in the House than in the previous one. It is a political message, and the Opposition’s charge that Suresh was denied his position because he is a Dalit may also be political. The government has signalled that it would continue its tough policy on critics, dissenters and Opposition leaders with the sanction for the prosecution of writer Arundhati Roy and the Enforcement Directorate’s hot pursuit of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. It will be unfortunate if it follows a policy hostile to the Opposition in parliament also. The 17th Lok Sabha was marred by suspensions, expulsions and disqualifications of Opposition members, acrimonious exchanges, poor debates, casual legislative work and a total domination by the government. There was no Deputy Speaker, a post mandated by the Constitution. There were hopes that the new Lok Sabha would function better. The Opposition members who are part of the panel to assist the pro tem Speaker have decided to protest by not performing their duties. There are signs that the situation might escalate further. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Neither Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar, who invited the heads of academies to a meeting at the Congress party office nor those who attended it have acted in the right manner. The incident showed a serious lack of propriety on both sides. It was bad enough that Shivakumar convened the meeting, and it is worse that he defended it. If at all the minister wanted to meet the academy heads, he should have invited them to his office in the Vidhana Soudha. When Shivakumar met them at the party office, it was the Congress president meeting them, and it was a political meeting. Academies are autonomous bodies and they should not be reduced to wings of political parties. Its heads are regarded as informed and enlightened. They should not have demeaned their positions by kowtowing to a politician. Shivakumar’s defence was misconceived and showed his ignorance or poor understanding of the relationship between the government and the academies. A group of writers has demanded an apology from him for his defence. Shivakumar said that there was nothing wrong in holding the meeting at the party office because the academy heads were appointed by the government. But the government is not the party. The academies, their heads and staff, as also their activities, are supported by the tax-paying people, not by the Congress party. According to reports, the academy heads were told to work for the Congress in the elections. The aim of the academies is promotion of the arts, literature, language and culture. They shouldn’t be promoting political parties or their leaders. Their responsibility is to the people, not to the ruling party. Both the minister and his guests should accept their mistake and express regret. Culture involves all human activities of the mind, body and imagination which find expression in the arts, literature, sports, and social conduct and relations, including politics. Thus, cultural bodies cannot be reduced to political entities; they should preserve their institutional integrity. Those who hold positions in them should separate their politics from their positions and realise that they have a greater and more durable idea to protect. Otherwise the institutions will lose their credibility and standing. Standards of conduct fall and compromises are made when academy positions are given away as rewards for political or personal loyalty. The Congress had rightly criticised the BJP government for politicising cultural institutions and pushing the Hindutva agenda through them. They would be hypocritical if they followed the same policy. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: Human lives are much more important than the transitory political interests, New Delhi’s envoy to Ottawa, Sanjay Kumar Verma, said, paying homage to the victims of the bombing of Air India’s aircraft ‘Kanishka’ in 1985 and subtly reminding Canada of the danger of yielding space to extremists seeking to carve out a Khalistan from India. “No government in the world should overlook the threat of terrorism emanating from its territories for political gains,” Verma said amid continuing tension between New Delhi and Ottawa over the lack of initiative on the part of the government led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over the activities of the anti-India Khalistani Sikh extremists in Canada. The Khalistani Sikh extremists had blown up Air India’s Kanishka aircraft when it had been flying from Montreal to London on June 23, 1985. All the 307 passengers, including 86 children, and 22 members of the crew onboard had been killed as the aircraft had disintegrated over the Atlantic Ocean. New Delhi used the memorial ceremony held on the occasion of the 39th anniversary of the bombing of the aircraft to send out a message to Justin Trudeau’s government in Ottawa. India has been alleging that the Khalistani Sikh extremists had been given much political space in Canada. The House of Commons – the lower chamber of the bicameral federal legislature of Canada – recently paid homage to Khalistani Sikh extremist, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who had been killed in June 2023 in front of a gurdwara at Surrey in the British Columbia province of the North American nation. “All terrorist activities should be met with exemplary legal and social actions before they start harming the larger humanity,” Verma said on Sunday. “(The) Governments, security agencies, and international organizations must work in concert to dismantle terrorist networks, disrupt their financing, and counter their twisted ideologies.” Nijjar had been accused in several cases in India, including the ones involving murder, terrorist activities, and sedition. The Interpol had in 2014 and 2016 issued Red Corner Notices against him on India’s request for his alleged role in killing six people in a blast at a cinema in Ludhiana in Punjab in 2007. The US had also put him on the ‘No-Fly’ list in 2019. Canada had granted him citizenship in 2015. He had been heading the gurdwara at Surrey in the British Columbia province of Canada. He had been shot dead in the parking lot of the gurdwara on June 18, 2023. New Delhi’s relations with Ottawa nosedived after Trudeau on September 18 last year had told the House of Commons that his government’s security agencies had been actively pursuing the ‘credible allegations’ about ‘a potential link’ between the agents of the Government of India and the killing of Nijjar in Canada. New Delhi had dismissed Ottawa’s allegation, calling it ‘absurd’, ‘motivated’, and ‘unsubstantiated’. Some Khalistani Sikh radicals on June 18 assembled in front of the Consulate General of India in Vancouver on the occasion of the first death anniversary of Nijjar. They held a mock trial for the killing of Nijjar, with an effigy of Modi dressed in prison stripes inside a makeshift cage and actors playing roles of a jury and a judge. New Delhi conveyed its displeasure to Ottawa over the silence observed in the parliament of Canada as well as over the permission granted for holding the mock trial of the prime minister of India. “We naturally oppose any moves giving political space to extremism and advocacy of violence,” Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, said in New Delhi on Friday. Family members and friends of the victims, officials of the Government of Canada including the Assistant RCMP Commissioner, ambassador of Ireland to Canada, and more than 150 members of the Indo-Canadian community attended the solemn occasion to pay homage to the victims of the bombing on Air India’s aircraft Kanishka. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Moscow: The death toll from a series of brazen attacks on churches and synagogues in Russia's mainly Muslim region of Dagestan rose to 19 on Monday after gunmen went on the rampage in coordinated attacks in two of the republic's most important cities. Gunmen with automatic weapons burst into an Orthodox church and a synagogue in the ancient city of Derbent on Sunday evening, setting fire to an icon at the church and killing a 66-year-old Orthodox priest, Nikolai Kotelnikov. In the Caspian city of Makhachkala, About 125 km (75 miles) north, attackers shot at a traffic police post and attacked a church. Gun battles erupted around the Assumption Cathedral in Makhachkala and heavy automatic gunfire rang out late into the night. Footage showed residents running through the city to seek cover as plumes of smoke rose above Makhachkala. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Russia's investigative committee said 15 policemen and four civilians were killed. At least five attackers were killed, some were shown by local media shot dead on a pavement. \"This is a day of tragedy for Dagestan and the whole country,\" said Sergei Melikov, the head of the Dagestan region. He said that foreign forces had been involved in preparing the attack, but gave no details. \"This is an attempt to cleave apart our unity.\" Dagestan announced three days of mourning. Pictures of the dead policemen were lined up on the street before red carnations in Dagestan. President Vladimir Putin, who has long accused the West of trying to stoke separatism in the Caucasus, has yet to comment. Dagestan is a mainly Muslim republic of Russia's North Caucasus, a patchwork of ethnic groups, languages and regions that live in the shadow of the Caucasus mountains between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. The attack on Christian and Jewish places of worship stoked fears Russia may be facing a renewed militant Islamist threat just three months after a deadly attack in Moscow. In the Moscow attack, 145 people were killed at the Crocus concert hall. Islamic State claimed that attack. In October, after the war in Gaza broke out, rioters waving Palestinian flags broke down glass doors and rampaged through Makhachkala airport to look for Jewish passengers on a flight arriving from Tel Aviv. In Israel, the foreign ministry said the synagogue in Derbent had been burned to the ground and shots had been fired at a second synagogue in Makhachkala. The statement said it was believed there were no worshippers in the synagogue at the time. Derbent, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities on earth, is home to an ancient Jewish community and a UNESCO World Heritage site. Russia's state media cited law enforcement as saying two sons of the head of central Dagestan's Sergokala district were among the attackers in Dagestan and had been detained by investigators. June 24-26 have been declared days of mourning in Dagestan, Melikov said, with flags lowered to half-mast and all entertainment events cancelled. The Russian empire expanded into the Caucasus in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, but an insurgency after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union led to two wars. In August 1999, Chechen fighter Shamil Basayev led fighters into Dagestan in a bid to aid Dagestani Wahhabist fundamentalists, triggering a major bombing campaign by the Russian military ahead of the Second Chechen War. #Elections2024"

One of the victims, a 38-year-old man, died after he was stabbed in the neck in the vicinity of East 14th Street near Avenue A, police said. The other two victims were a 51-year-old woman who was stabbed in the leg, and a 32-year-old man who was stabbed in the back. The woman was in critical condition at Bellevue Hospital, and the man was in stable condition. A 30-year-old man was in police custody, and a “cutting instrument” was recovered from the scene, officials said. It was unclear Sunday whether he would be charged in the stabbings or whether he knew the victims. Police received several 911 calls around 5:45 p.m. about the stabbings. Fozlul Karim, 22, of the Bronx, who is the manager of a Domino’s Pizza on the block, said he was inside cooking when a customer ran into the store. The customer told him that several people had been stabbed, and he rushed outside. He and dozens of others watched as officers and emergency medical workers on 14th Street between First Avenue and Avenue A put the woman on a stretcher and wheeled her to an ambulance, according to a cellphone video that Karim took of the scene. One officer yelled “Move, move, move!” so people would get out of the way. Karim said he was shaken by the episode. “We’re scared,” he said. Hours after the attack, Olivia McLeod, 24, who lives across the street, stood near the scene. Several pieces of blood-spattered clothing were strewed across the pavement. The stabbings, McLeod said, rattled her. “I will keep my head on a swivel from now on,” she said. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Taipei: Democracy is not a crime and autocracy is the real \"evil\", Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Monday after China threatened to impose the death penalty in extreme cases for \"diehard\" Taiwan independence separatists. China, which views Taiwan as its own territory, has made no secret of its dislike of Lai, who took office last month, saying he is a \"separatist\", and staged war games shortly after his inauguration. On Friday, China ramped up its pressure on Taiwan by issuing new legal guidelines to punish those it says support the island's formal independence, though Chinese courts have no jurisdiction on the democratically governed island. Asked about China's move at a news conference at the presidential office in Taipei, Lai first reiterated his sympathy for recent flooding in southern China before responding. \"I want to stress: democracy is not a crime; it's autocracy that is the real evil. China has absolutely no right to sanction Taiwan's people just because of the positions they hold. What's more, China has no right to go after Taiwan people's rights across borders,\" he said. According China, anyone who does not uphold \"reunification\" is therefore a Taiwan independence supporter, Lai added. \"I also want to call on China to face up to the existence of the Republic of China and have exchanges and dialogue with Taiwan's democratically elected, legitimate government,\" he said, using Taiwan's formal name. \"If this is not done, relations between Taiwan and China will only become more and more estranged.\" Lai rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims and says only Taiwan's people can decide their future. He has repeatedly offered talks with China but been rebuffed. China says any move by Taiwan to declare formal independence would be grounds to attack the island. The government in Taipei says Taiwan is already an independent country, the Republic of China, and that it does not plan to change that. The Republican government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's Communists. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Cairo: More than 1,300 people died making the Islamic pilgrimage of hajj in Saudi Arabia this month, the vast majority of whom the Saudi government said did not have permits. Many walked for miles in scorching heat after paying thousands of dollars to illicit tour operators. While pilgrims with permits are transported around the holy city of Mecca in air-conditioned buses and rest in air-conditioned tents, unregistered ones are often exposed to the elements. In recent days, as temperatures surpassed 120 degrees, some pilgrims described watching people faint and passing bodies in the street. On Sunday, in an interview on state television, the Saudi health minister, Fahd bin Abdurrahman Al-Jalajel, said that 83 per cent of the 1,301 reported deaths involved pilgrims who lacked permits. “The rise in temperatures during the hajj season represented a big challenge this year,” he said. “Unfortunately — and this is painful for all of us — those who didn’t have hajj permits walked long distances under the sun.” Al-Jalajel’s remarks came after days of silence from the Saudi government over the fatalities during the hajj, an arduous and deeply spiritual ritual that Muslims are encouraged to perform at least once in their lifetimes if they can. With nearly 2 million participating each year, it is not unusual for pilgrims to die from heat stress, illness or chronic disease. It is unclear if the number of deaths this year was higher than usual, because Saudi Arabia does not regularly report those statistics. In 1985, more than 1,700 people died around the holy sites, most of them from heat stress, a study at the time found. But because so many of those who died had no permits, this year’s toll exposed an underworld of illicit tour operators and smugglers who profit off Muslims desperate to make the journey. The deaths also laid bare what appeared to be a failure of Saudi immigration and security procedures aimed at preventing unregistered pilgrims from reaching the holy sites, including a security cordon around Mecca that locks down weeks before hajj. Despite those efforts, an estimated 400,000 undocumented people tried to perform the pilgrimage this year, a senior Saudi official told Agence France-Presse, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Saudi officials did not respond to requests for comment. In interviews with The New York Times , however, hajj tour operators, pilgrims and relatives of the dead described easily exploited loopholes that allow people to travel to the kingdom with a tourist or visitor visa before hajj. Once they arrive, they find a network of illegal brokers and smugglers who offer their services, take their money and sometimes abandon them to fend for themselves, they said. The number of unregistered pilgrims appeared to have been driven up this year by rising economic desperation in countries such as Egypt and Jordan. An official hajj package can cost more than $5,000 or $10,000, depending on a pilgrim’s country of origin — far beyond the means of many hoping to make the trip. Marwa, a 32-year-old Egyptian woman whose parents performed hajj without an official permit this year, said they had paid around $2,000 for their journey, facilitated by an agent in Egypt and a broker in Saudi Arabia. They felt they had to go soon because, as Egypt’s currency loses value, their savings shrink every year, she said. Marwa asked to be identified only by her first name to avoid legal repercussions. Several countries that recorded large numbers of deceased pilgrims have moved quickly to address the fallout. On Friday, the president of Tunisia, which counted more than 50 pilgrims among the dead, fired the country’s religious affairs minister. In Jordan, which recorded the deaths of at least 99 pilgrims, the public prosecutor opened an investigation into illegal hajj routes. And in Egypt, authorities said they would revoke the licenses of 16 companies that issued visas to pilgrims without providing them with adequate services. “There’s so much greed around this business,” said Iman Ahmed, co-owner of El-Iman Tours in Cairo. Ahmed said that she refused to send unregistered pilgrims on hajj packages but that other Egyptian tour operators and Saudi brokers made big money doing so. One unregistered pilgrim who died was Safaa al-Tawab, a grandmother from the Egyptian city of Luxor, according to her brother, Ahmed. Al-Tawab, 55, had not been able to obtain a hajj permit but found an Egyptian tour company to take her for around $3,000, her brother said. She did not realize that she was violating the rules when she traveled to Saudi Arabia last month, her brother said, and after she arrived, she told relatives that she had been put in inadequate housing and prevented from going outside. Although the tour operator had promised air-conditioned buses to take the pilgrims around Mecca, she instead found herself walking for miles in the heat, her brother said. She died midway through the pilgrimage, but when her brother contacted a representative from the tour company, he assured him that she was fine, then later turned off his phone, her brother said. Before the hajj, Saudi authorities posted billboards and sent a barrage of text messages reminding people that it is illegal to perform the pilgrimage without a permit; violators face fines, deportation and bans on reentering the kingdom. Entry to Mecca was barred weeks before hajj for visitors who did not have permits. Yet, many pilgrims were able to evade the restrictions, arriving in Mecca early and hiding out, or paying smugglers to ferry them into the city. Even for the young and fit, the hajj is a physically challenging event, and many pilgrims are elderly or ailing by the time they can make the journey. Some believe that the hajj might be their final rite, and that dying in Mecca will confer great blessings. The Saudi government deploys measures to reduce the effects of extreme heat, including spraying pilgrims with mists of water and incorporating shading into some sites. Abdulhalim Dahir, 31, a Kenyan pilgrim who made the hajj with his brother and father using official permits, said his journey was generally smooth, with air-conditioned tents, air-conditioned buses and easy access to water. “It was an amazing experience — once in a lifetime,” he said. But even some who were in Mecca with documentation complained about inadequate facilities for the heat. Makhdoom Ali, 36, a Pakistani computer engineer who traveled there with his 65-year-old mother, said he had seen several pilgrims collapse from heat exhaustion with no immediate assistance available. Despite his joy at completing the hajj, Ali said he was troubled by the hardships they encountered and that he had feared for the health of his mother throughout the journey. “Many lives could have been saved with better government arrangements,” Ali said. Al-Jalajel, the health minister, said that one-fourth of the health services provided during hajj were rendered to undocumented pilgrims. “We look at them as a pilgrim, regardless of their permit, race or nationality, and they receive full services,” he said. Among the dead were at least two Americans. Maryland residents Isatu Wurie, 65, and Alieu Wurie, 71, had saved for years to make the pilgrimage, paying $23,000 to a local tour operator, said their daughter, Saida. But after they arrived in Mecca, the operator told them to stay in their hotel until permits were issued for them, and transportation they had been promised was not always available, they told their daughter. Her parents were frustrated because they had believed they were going “by the book,” she said. They were still able to perform some of the initial rituals of hajj, and they were “so excited to see the Kaaba,” the cubic structure that pilgrims circumambulate, she said. But the last message she received from her mother said that a bus to take them to one of the sites had not arrived, and that they had been walking for two hours instead. Despite her frustration at the tour operator — as well as the difficulty of locating their bodies, buried in Mecca — Wurie believes her parents were filled with joy in their final days. “They died doing exactly what they wanted to do,” she said. “They’ve always wanted to make it to hajj.” #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : A video clip showing US President Joe Biden appearing to have wandered off from the group of G7 leaders while they were posing for a picture during the meet in Italy turns out to have been edited. The unedited video shows the US President was appreciating a skydiving flags ceremony. That said, Biden is no stranger to gaffes, and was seen awkwardly giving a salute to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni after he landed. In the edited and untrue video, which was shared online, Biden could be seen walking away from the group of leaders before the Italian PM notices and guides him back to take a photograph. The clip shows Biden smiling, and moving away a few feet before he shows an enthusiastic thumbs-up to someone. However, when the camera moves towards him, nobody else can be seen in that direction. In the unedited video, it can be seen that the thumbs-up is directed towards one of the participants in the skydiving event. Another video of his interaction with Meloni, upon arrival, has also gone viral where the US President is seen shuffling to the stage and echanging pleasantries with Meloni. After talking for some time, he raises his hand to his forehead, saluting her, before he slowly walks off stage. WTF? Why is Biden saluting Italy's PM Giorgia Meloni? pic.twitter.com/wPtYyl9XpC Biden's most recent incident comes after he was mocked by Republicans for appearing to be virtually motionless for almost a minute while a musical performance was on at the White House. While Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, who were next to Biden, appeared to be dancing and laughing through the show, the president's gaze was fixated and he appeared frozen. His rivals have often mocked him in an attempt to discredit Biden as a viable president choice, due to his advanced age, as the US heads to polls. This is not the first time the US leader has had an awkward moment with other world leaders either. In February, Biden confused French President Emmanuel Macron's name with Francois Mitterrand - the former leader who has been dead for almost three decades. In a similar snafu, he referred to VP Harris as 'President'. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : By Ruth Pollard It is the ultimate act of bad faith. The United Nations (UN) has decided to exclude women from its upcoming global conference on Afghanistan . Why? The Taliban , it seems, insisted on it. The Islamic fundamentalist group wasn’t invited to the first meeting in May 2023, and refused to attend the next one in February because the UN wouldn’t accept the list of preconditions for its participation. “These conditions first of all denied us the right to talk to other representatives of the Afghan society and demanded a treatment that would, I would say, to a large extent be similar to recognition” of the Taliban as the governing authority, Secretary-General António Guterres said at the time. So, what has changed? It’s unclear what led the UN to agree to the Taliban’s demands for the talks in Doha that begin on June 30, though the global body insists “this sort of engagement is not legitimisation or normalisation”. I’d call it something else. An egregious breach of trust — one that places security and counterterrorism concerns above the rights of women, girls and minorities. As important as the Taliban’s presence at the meeting is — the US and its allies see the Taliban’s battle against the Islamic State-Khorasan group as vital to controlling the threat of terrorism emanating from Central Asia — there were other options beyond surrendering human rights to extremists. In November, the UN laid out a road map for engagement with the Taliban that required improvements in women’s rights before the UN would consider officially recognizing it as the country’s governing entity. A month later, the Security Council called for Afghan women to be involved in the political process and for the establishment of a special envoy for Afghanistan to coordinate international engagement. It is also considering recommendations to recognize “gender apartheid” as a crime against humanity. On every aspect, the UN is dragging its feet. There is no special envoy, and no sign of movement on gender apartheid. Its own Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, last week presented a comprehensive set of recommendations for dismantling the Taliban’s institutionalised system of gender oppression. They involve tackling the culture of impunity that has long existed in Afghanistan by punishing crimes committed by the Taliban, its agents and supporters. This can be done via “universal jurisdiction” which enables a state to prosecute perpetrators of the most serious international offenses regardless of where they were committed or the nationality of the perpetrators and the victims. Bennett’s report makes for grim reading. It documents discrimination, segregation, disrespect for human dignity and exclusion, motivated by the Taliban’s profound rejection of women and girls’ humanity. They now have increasingly narrow roles: as bearers and rearers of children, and as objects available for exploitation, including debt bondage, domestic servitude and sexual exploitation. Women and girls are banned from education beyond sixth grade. In March, the Taliban issued an order that women be stoned to death for so-called “moral crimes.” There are efforts underway to initiate a case at the International Court of Justice, and it is here that the global community could make a difference. It takes just one country that is a signatory to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women to step up. Bennett also calls for better funding for a separate investigation by the International Criminal Court into crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Afghanistan since May 2003. He notes Afghans’ frustration with the lengthy preliminary examination and investigation. (ICJ decisions are subject to enforcement by the Security Council, but each of the five permanent members can veto any decision, while the ICC doesn’t have its own enforcement body. It relies on countries to make arrests, freeze suspects’ assets and enforce sentences.) Importantly, Bennett says that nations should “avoid normalization or legitimization of the de facto authorities” until the human-rights situation improves, especially for women and girls. It is hard to understand why another arm of this global body meant to defend and protect human rights would do the opposite of what its own expert is recommending. It is, as Heather Barr of Human Rights Watch notes, “enraging” that the UN has done this. “There are certain lines they shouldn’t cross,” she told me. “This is one of them.” Not surprisingly, Afghan women and human-rights defenders are calling for nations to boycott this meeting. That will present a dilemma for many countries, particularly those committed to gender justice and concerned about the rise in terrorist activities that originate in Afghanistan. Since its inception in 2015, Islamic State-Khorasan — named for the historic region encompassing parts of Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asia — has expanded its international reach. The attack on a Moscow concert in March that killed more than 140 people, as well as suicide bombings in Iran that claimed 95 lives in January, were both linked to IS-K. Earlier this month, eight people from Tajikistan, some with suspected ties to the Islamic State, were arrested in the US. But while the Taliban may be attempting to shut down IS-K, it is still uncomfortably close to al-Qaeda — indeed the UN reported in June last year that several al-Qaeda leaders have been given key posts within the regime. The world cannot afford to offer the Taliban some kind of clemency over its human-rights abuses simply because it is resisting another terrorist group. That is the worst kind of foreign policy. We must abandon the idea, once and for all, that the rights of women and girls are there to be traded off at will. They’re not. #Elections2024"

Two years on, the two young Iranians' political views remain at odds, reflecting a rift that will shape the outcome of presidential elections this week. Now 22, Atousa says she will abstain from voting in Friday's ballot to choose a successor to Ebrahim Raisi after his death in a helicopter crash, regarding the exercise with derision. But Reza, 26, a religiously devout member of the hardline Basij militia, intends to vote, a contrasting view of the worth of the election that underscores the division in Iran between supporters and opponents of the 45-year-old Islamic Republic. All six candidates - five hardliners and a low-key moderate approved by a hardline watchdog body - have been wooing youthful voters in speeches and campaign messages, using social media to reach the 60 per cent of the 85 million population aged under 30. \"This election, like all elections in Iran, is a circus. Why should I vote when I want the regime to be toppled?\" Atousa told Reuters . She declined to be identified by her full name for security reasons. \"Even if it was a free and fair election and if all candidates could enter the race, the president in Iran has no power,\" she said. The hashtag #ElectionCircus has been widely posted on social media platform X by Iranians in the past few weeks, while some Iranians at home and abroad have called for an election boycott. Under Iran's clerical system, the elected president runs the government day-to-day, but his powers are circumscribed by those of the hardline supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last word on top issues such as nuclear and foreign policy. 'Religious duty to vote' Like many women and young Iranians, Atousa joined protests in 2022 sparked by the death of a young Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, in police custody, following her arrest for allegedly violating Iran's mandatory Islamic dress code. The unrest spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years. Atousa, then a student, was arrested during the protests and her dream of becoming an architect was shattered when she was expelled from university as a punishment for participating in the demonstrations. The Basij, a plain-clothes arm of the elite Revolutionary Guards, deployed alongside uniformed security during the 2022 unrest and helped suppress demonstrations with deadly force. Over 500 people including 71 minors were killed in the protests, hundreds injured and thousands arrested in unrest that was eventually crushed by security forces, rights groups said. Iran carried out seven executions linked to the unrest. Authorities have not given any official estimated death toll, but said dozens of security forces were killed in \"riots\". \"I will sacrifice my life for the leader and the Islamic Republic. It is my religious duty to vote. My participation will strengthen the Nezam (system),\" said Reza, from the low-income Nazi Abad district in south Tehran. Reza said he will support a hardline candidate who champions Khamenei's \"resistance economy\", a phrase meaning economic self-sufficiency, strengthening trade ties with regional neighbours and improving economic interaction with China and Russia. The economy is beset by mismanagement, state corruption and sanctions reimposed since 2018 after the US ditched Tehran's 2015 nuclear pact with six world powers. Reza and Atousa, both born after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, have regrets about the 2022 demonstrations, albeit for different reasons. Reza blames the protests for bringing mounting pressure on Iran from Western countries, which imposed sanctions on Iranian security forces and officials for alleged human rights abuses. Iran accused Western powers of fomenting the unrest. \"I wish the protests had not taken place ... our enemies used it as a pretext to mount pressure on our country,\" he said. Atousa looks back on that period with sadness. \"I was hopeful,\" she said. \"I thought finally the change will come and I will be able to live a life with no suppression in a free country ... I paid a heavy price, but the regime is still here.\" #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Ottawa: Terming the frequent acts glorifying terrorism in Canada as \"deplorable\", India has said it was \"unfortunate\" that such actions are allowed to be \"routine\" on many occasions here when it should be condemned by all peace-loving countries and people. In a statement on the 39th anniversary of the 1985 Kanishka bombing, in which 329 persons, most of them Canadians of Indian descent, on board an Air India flight lost their lives, the Indian High Commission said that terrorism knows \"no borders, nationality, or race\". The Montreal-New Delhi Air India 'Kanishka' Flight 182 exploded 45 minutes before it was to have landed at London's Heathrow Airport on June 23, 1985, killing all 329 people on board, including 86 children. The bombing was blamed on Sikh militants in retaliation to 'Operation Bluestar' to flush out militants from the Golden Temple in 1984. The Indian High Commission in Ottawa and the consulates of India in Toronto and Vancouver organised memorial services on Sunday and solemnly remembered the victims of the \"dastardly act of terror\" in 1985. \"While thirty-nine years have passed since the cowardly act, terrorism has unfortunately assumed proportions of an existential threat to international peace and security today,\" the Indian high commission's statement said. \"Any act of glorifying terrorism, including the bombing of Al-182 in 1985, is deplorable and should be condemned by all peace-loving countries and people,\" it said. \"It is unfortunate that such actions are allowed to be routine on many occasions in Canada,\" it added. Last week, India strongly objected to the Canadian parliament observing a \"one-minute silence\" in memory of Khalistan extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was gunned down in British Columbia in June last year. India also insisted on Friday that the Canadian authorities must take action against those advocating violence and carrying out an anti-India campaign in Canada. India lodged a strong protest with Canada on Thursday over Khalistani extremists holding a so-called \"citizens court\" and burning an effigy of the Indian prime minister outside the Indian consulate in Vancouver. Asserting that terrorism knows \"no borders, nationality, or race\" and it is a challenge that the international community needs to combat collectively, the Indian mission here said that over the years, India has led from the front to counter-terrorism with support from like-minded countries. Terming the Kanishka bombing \"the worst ever in Canadian aviation history to date\", the Indian mission said that the incident will remain an \"unbearable loss\" not only for the victims' families but also for humanity as a whole. \"The perpetrators and the co-conspirators of this dastardly act remain free,\" it said. Quoting External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, the statement said, \"...Nor must we countenance that political convenience determines responses to terrorism, extremism and violence. Similarly, respect for territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs cannot be exercised in cherry picking.\" It called the spirit of the minister's statement from his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last year the \"best tribute\" to the victims of Air India Flight 182 bombing. High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma on Sunday paid homage to the victims of Air India flight 182 Kanishka on the 39th anniversary of the \"cowardly terrorist bombing\", the High Commission in Ottawa posted on X along with a series of photographs from the event. Family members and friends of the victims, Canadian government officials, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner, Ireland envoy and more than 150 members of the Indo-Canadian community attended the solemn occasion, the High Commission said. \"India shares the sorrow and pain of the victims' near & dear ones. India stands at the forefront of countering the menace of terrorism and works closely with all nations to tackle this global threat,\" it said. The Indian mission in Toronto also marked the day. \"Consul General Siddhartha Nath laid a wreath at the Air India 182 memorial, Humber Park, Etobicoke, in solemn remembrance of the 329 victims of the terrorist bombing of AI 182 on this day, 39 years ago,\" the Consulate General of India in Toronto posted on X along with a photograph. In another post on X, the mission said the Consul General also attended the memorial service held at Queen’s Park Toronto for the victims and met with the bereaved families. The memorial services were held at a time when relations between Canada and India are under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of a \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in Nijjar's killing. New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\" and \"motivated\". India has been maintaining that the main issue between the two countries is that of Ottawa giving space to pro-Khalistan elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Kyiv: A veteran of Ukraine's 2014 revolution who is now fighting Russian forces, Yehor Sobolev knows the price of Kyiv's decade-long drive to join the European Union as well as anyone. Having backed tough reforms as a lawmaker after the pro-democracy uprising 10 years ago, he says he will look on proudly from the front as formal accession talks open on Tuesday. \"We Ukrainians know how to fulfil our dreams,\" said the 47-year-old deputy commander of a special army unit. The launch of talks, though largely ceremonial, is an important step for a nation that has spilled blood and pushed through the reforms required in its pursuit of EU membership. \"Ukraine is returning to Europe, where it has belonged for centuries, as a full-fledged member of the European community,\" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday. Kyiv filed its request to join the EU days after Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. It sees membership as validation of its fight to embrace European values. It now faces a lengthy path to accession, and needs to overhaul a bureaucracy still riddled with vestiges of Soviet days. The task will be complicated by the war with Russia that has no end in sight, with Ukrainian towns and cities under constant threat of Russian air strikes that have killed many civilians as well as soldiers, forced millions from their homes and damaged critical and energy infrastructure. In many ways, Sobolev's story is a picture of Ukraine's trajectory over the past decade. He was a prominent figure in the Maidan revolution that toppled a Russia-backed leader after protests triggered by him breaking a promise to develop closer ties with the EU. Sobolev later worked on legislation that formed the foundation of Ukraine's anti-corruption infrastructure, central to securing financial aid and backing for Kyiv's integration with the EU. He also co-authored a law aimed at erasing traces of Ukraine's Soviet legacy and Russian influence by paving the way for the renaming of thousands of streets, towns and cities, and the removal of monuments. In 2021, Sobolev donned a uniform and rose from a rank-and-file Ukrainian soldier to officer, as Russia broadened a war that Kyiv says began in 2014 after Moscow seized the Crimea peninsula and fuelled an insurgency in the east. \"The top corrupt officials that we dealt with on the Maidan are the same kinds of leaders of the 'Russian world' like (President Vladimir) Putin,\" he said. \"So for me it's one war.\" Long road ahead The accession talks are expected to start at a ministerial meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday, days before Hungary, which has closer ties to Russia than other member states, takes over the EU's six-month rotating presidency. Ukraine cleared initial hurdles to accession in December by showing progress in fighting corruption and rebuilding its judiciary, among other areas the EU considers fundamental. Now it must map out a more detailed plan to achieve lasting results that will be measured by a range of benchmarks, said Leonid Litra of the New Europe Centre, a think tank in Kyiv. It will later move on to fields ranging from agriculture and taxation to tackling climate change. \"If you want to have a merit-based and predictable process, you need to get a very clear to-do list,\" he said. Sobolev, a father of four, knows the road ahead will not be easy, citing old mentalities that are still firmly rooted in some parts of government. But Ukrainians are likely become \"much more serious students\" of good governance as the prospect of joining the 27-nation bloc comes closer into focus, he said. \"In this sense, war forces a society to grow up,\" he said. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Pro-independence protesters burned police vehicles and blocked roads in New Caledonia on Monday, authorities in the French Pacific territory said, as anger erupted over the extradition to France of jailed protest leader Christian Tein. France's High Commission in Noumea said in a statement that protesters had also set fire to the town hall in the Koumac commune, as well as destroyed areas in Paita. The Dumbea municipal council said a firefighting vehicle was attacked, possibly by gunshots, and some schools were forced to close due to the protests, which began in May after France voted to approve reforms to allow thousands more French residents who have lived in the territory for 10 years to vote. Indigenous Kanaks fear this reform will dilute their vote and make it harder for any future referendum on independence to pass, while Paris says the measure is needed to improve democracy. Daniel Goa, president of Caledonian Union, the biggest pro-independence political party, said in a statement he was \"astonished\" at the deportation of Tein and six other party officials on Saturday night. \"All they have done has been to organise more peaceful demonstrations,\" he said. He denied the prosecutor's allegations that Tein and the others were sponsors of violence. Police had arrested Tein, who leads an offshoot of Caledonian Union called Field Action Coordination Cell (CCAT) last week. CCAT have set up barricades that have disrupted traffic for weeks, and Tein had met French President Emmanuel Macron during a visit to Noumea last month aimed at resolving the political impasse. On Monday French loyalist politicians including Sonia Backes and Nicolas Metzdorf said in a statement a third of local business had been destroyed and they had sent a letter to Macron requesting the New Caledonia government be placed under state administration, as it was \"no longer fit to lead\". #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Seoul: Among the trash that balloons carried over the border from North were articles printed with Hello Kitty characters, badly worn clothing, and soil containing traces of human feces and parasites, South Korea said on Monday. North Korea has flown balloons carrying trash since late May, with hundreds landing in South Korea. South Korea deployed military explosives units and chemical and biological warfare teams to inspect the objects. The items also included clothes that had been donated from the South that were slashed and cut up, and general trash that appeared to be hastily collected, the South's Unification Ministry, which handles the North, said in a report. North Korea has said the balloons were retaliation for a propaganda campaign by North Korean defectors and activists in the South who regularly send over balloons carrying food, medicine, money and leaflets criticising the North's leaders. Parasites and human DNA were found in the dirt in some of the plastic bags, which shows it contained fertilizer that used human feces, the Unification Ministry said. North Korea, which suffers a chronic food shortage, depended on South Korea for massive shipments of chemical fertilizer until such aid was suspended in 2007 as Pyongyang accelerated weapons development. The trash contained worn items of clothing with Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh and Hello Kitty characters as well as socks, gloves and children's clothes that had been heavily patched up, masks with fabric stitched by hand and two layers of shirts sewn together. Last week, the North warned it would send more balloons carrying trash. #Elections2024"

As the AIADMK continued to protest inside the legislative assembly for the second consecutive day, the ruling DMK alleged that the state’s principal opposition party was “using” the Kallakurichi incident to “hide” its Lok Sabha election failure. Law Minister S Regupathy wondered why the AIADMK was hell bent on walking out of the House when Speaker M Appavu assured them that he will give them a chance to raise the issue after the Question Hour. “The AIADMK should explain why they insisted that they will discuss the issue only by suspending the Question Hour. “You seem to be in some crisis. The House cannot allow you space for you to resolve your problems,” Appavu told Palaniswami and his MLAs after they shouted slogans against the government. Later, Palaniswami alleged that the Opposition MLAs are being denied an opportunity to present people’s problems in the Assembly. “So many lives have been lost. Where else do we discuss the problem if we aren't in the assembly?” he asked. The Leader of Opposition also alleged that a DMK MLA was also involved in protecting the accused in the tragedy. Separately, two DMK MLAs T Udhayasuriyan and Vasantham K Karthikeyan addressed a press conference and threatened to file a defamation case against PMK founder S Ramadoss and his son Anbumani Ramadoss for connecting them with the illicit liquor mafia. “They are making baseless allegations against us. We have been in politics for decades together and we have never indulged in any illegal activity,” the MLAs said. Meanwhile, the Kallakurichi district administration screened people in the affected Karunapuram area and admitted about 50 of them who consumed illicit liquor to a hospital. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Thiruvananthapuram/New Delhi: Unlike most minority community members of the BJP who have joined the saffron outfit in its prime after spending years in other parties, George Kurian's record is different. In 1980, at the age of 19, the young devout Christian defied conventions to join the newborn BJP along with a group of Jan Sangh leaders in Kerala. He stood firm in his political convictions despite his family and friends being averse to his new affiliation. BJP was a political pariah in Kerala though RSS had its 'shakhas' across the state. It was the heady days of the Congress and the Left in Kerala. Forty-four years later, Kurian, a post graduate in Hindi and a law-degree holder, saw himself being sworn in as a Minister of State in Narendra Modi's team. He has been assigned ministries of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying as well as minority affairs. His elevation was a surprise for many Keralites and even for Kurian and his family, which includes his ex-military nurse wife and two sons, but not for those in the Sangh echo-system. He didn't contest the Lok Sabha election this time and was not expecting a ministerial post though he was known to the present BJP top echelons due to his previous stints in various capacities and as a translator for Hindi-speaking BJP leaders visiting Kerala. Not new to Delhi, Kurian served as Officer on Special Duty when Kerala BJP veteran O Rajagopal was a minister in the AB Vajpayee government and later in the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) as its Vice Chairperson. Cold political calculations marked by an outreach to Christians in Kerala and acknowledging a steadfast 'karyakarta', who is uncompromisingly wedded to the Sangh ideology, led to his elevation. This happened when all were expecting that only Suresh Gopi, a cine superstar who opened the Lok Sabha account for the BJP in Kerala, would be part of Modi's team. The choice of Kurian in the ministry without him being an MP showed how important his entry was for the BJP. Kurian's appointment is widely believed as a sort of BJP’s thanksgiving to a section of Christian voters who is believed to have contributed to Gopi's victory in Thrissur by defeating both the Congress and Left candidates. Amplifier and defender As the NCM member, Kurian was seen defending the BJP and helping it reach out to the church leadership in Kerala. Its earlier inductees like Alphonse Kannanthanam or Tom Vadakkan could not add much on this count. Kurian amplified what is seen as divisive campaigns, including one on 'love jihad' that was supported by a section in the Christian church. The Sangh Parivar had been in the forefront of this campaign accusing Muslim youths of luring girls of other faiths into marriage for using them in terror activities though Amit Shah-led Ministry of Home Affairs had said in Parliament that it did not find any evidence to back up the allegations. Kurian also often became the BJP's face of defence in Kerala on issues like the violence against Christians in Manipur during the ongoing ethnic conflict and in other parts of the country by right-wing outfits. Starting his political journey after being swayed by socialist leader Jayaprakash Narayan during his student days, Kurian got attracted to Sangh Parivar through RSS and Jana Sangh activists who were part of the Janata Party. He was then a student at KE College at Mannanam in Kottayam. His first assignment was to set up a unit of the Bharatiya Vidyarthi Morcha at the Government College, Kottayam. Afterwards, Kurian's political career graph kept on rising as he was appointed to various positions in the Yuva Morcha and in the state and national units of BJP. At present a vice president of Kerala BJP, Kurian has been acting as a bridge between the church leadership, especially the Catholics, and the BJP. As the saffron leader has to find a way into Parliament within six months of becoming a minister, he is likely to be nominated by the BJP in one of the ten vacant seats in Rajya Sabha. Electoral politics, however, is not new for Kurian as he has fought Lok Sabha elections twice from Kottayam and Assembly election once from Puthuppally. In the 1991 Lok Sabha election, he came third in Kottayam with 22,622 votes. He once again tried his luck in Kottayam in 1998 and managed to almost double his votes to 42,830 from 1991, but finished third. He fought against the then chief minister Oommen Chandy in the Puthuppally Assembly seat in 2016 where again he came third with 15,993 votes. For the BJP, Kurian's elevation is indeed like hitting two birds with one stone — pleasing the BJP cadres of Kerala by inducting a non-controversial leader acceptable to all factions and further fueling the saffron party's efforts to woo Christians, who are around 18 per cent of the state's population. To make inroads, the BJP needs to court a minority community in Kerala and it has chosen the Christians. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Thiruvananthapuram: Kozhikode in north Kerala, which is home to many literary luminaries like S K Pottekkatt, Vaikom Muhammad Basheer and M T Vasudevan Nair, and has around 70 publishing houses releasing up to 500 books every year and boasts of around 550 libraries, is being formally declared as UNESCO's 'City of Literature' on Sunday. It was a work done by a batch of students of National Institute of Technology, Calicut that helped the city get the tag in last December. Kerala local self-government minister M B Rajesh made the formal declaration on Sunday. The literary history of Kozhikode dates back to the 14th century. The city has been organising major literary festivals over the years attracting literary enthusiasts from within the country and outside. Huge participation of locals at literary festivals of Kozhikode too vindicates the city's bonding with literature. Every major spot of the city like the SM Street, popularly known as 'Mittayi theruvu' have memorials of the literary luminaries of Kozhikode. Apart from Pottekkatt, Basheer and Vasudevan Nair, other known writers of Kozhikode include Thikkodiyan, N N Kakkad, U A Khader and M N Karassery. UNESCO also considered various initiatives in Kozhikode to extend the role of literature in urban development and to strengthen citizen involvement. SecondPen, a forum of writers from the medical profession, as well as many such initiatives to promote literature among the citizens and effort to safeguard the city's literary heritage were also considered by UNESCO. A batch of students of NIT-C department of architecture and planning did the study as part of their academic work in 2023 which culminated in Kozhikode receiving the title. According to NIT-C head of department of architecture and planning Mohammed Firoz, who guided the students, no other cities could boast of such a network of libraries, and publishers. Kozhikode is among the 55 cities to be included in UNESCO's 'City of Literature'. There are around 300 other cities from different countries that are included in the Creative cities network of UNESCO. Kozhikode city mayor Beena Philip said that efforts would be made to organise literary events in association with other cities in the network. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: The Union Government needs to examine the long-standing demand of Andhra Pradesh and Bihar for special category status carefully and not in a hurry, as it could set a precedent and may put extreme pressure on the Centre's fiscal resources, former Niti Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar said on Sunday. Andhra Pradesh has been demanding special category status after its bifurcation in 2014 on the grounds of revenue loss as Hyderabad became the capital of Telangana. Bihar has also been demanding the special status since 2005 when Nitish Kumar was sworn in as its Chief Minister. The state also suffered revenue loss after the mineral-rich Jharkhand was carved out of it in 2000. \"This (SCS) is their (Bihar and Andhra Pradesh) long-standing demand...this is a demand which needs to be considered very carefully because you have to carefully examine in detail the economic parameters on the basis of which this demand is being made,\" he told PTI in a video interview. For special category status states, the Centre meets 90 per cent of the funds required in a centrally sponsored scheme against 60 per cent in the case of normal category states. The remaining funds are provided by the state government. \"Because...if you do it in a hurry, then this might set a precedent, which is not going to be fiscally possible because more and more states will be making the same demand if we do this here, and that would mean extreme pressure on the government's fiscal resources,\" the economist added. The 14th Finance Commission raised the share of states in taxes collected by the Centre to 42 per cent from 32 per cent but abolished special category states. \"So, I think this issue has to be reviewed and carefully studied. Maybe the Finance Commission should do this task,\" he opined. Under relentless opposition attack over its failure to secure special category state status for Andhra Pradesh, in 2018, the state's ruling party Telugu Desam Party (TDP) pulled out of the Modi government. Recently, Congress Party general secretary Jairam Ramesh asked the prime minister whether he would fulfil his 2014 election promise and the ten-year-old demand of his ally and JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar by giving special category status to Bihar. \"There has been a demand for this, but the PM did not break his silence on the issue,\" he added. With support from N Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and Nitish Kumar's JD(U), which won 16 and 12 seats in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, respectively, and other alliance partners, the NDA has crossed the halfway mark. Ramesh also said, \"On April 30, 2014, in the holy city of Tirupati, you promised to give special category status to Andhra Pradesh so that massive investment comes in. It's been 10 years, but it has not happened. Will that promise be fulfilled now? Will the PM give special category status to Andhra Pradesh\". The special status category was introduced in 1969 on the recommendation of the Fifth Finance Commission to benefit certain backward states with hilly terrains, strategic international borders, and economic and infrastructural backwardness. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh: Some news channels have gone off air at several places in Andhra Pradesh following the declaration of the results of the Assembly and Parliamentary elections with an opposition YSRCP Parliamentarian alleging coercion by the state government leading to them being blocked. Allegations of channels- TV9, NTV, 10TV and Sakshi TV - being blocked have been levelled against the NDA government, comprising TDP, BJP and Janasena. YSRCP Rajya Sabha member S Niranjan Reddy complained to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) over the alleged blocking of these four vernacular news channels by the government. In a recent letter to TRAI, Reddy claimed the Andhra Pradesh Cable TV Operators Association took these four channels off air due to alleged coercion by the TDP-led government in the state. \"I am compelled to bring to your (TRAI) esteemed attention the illegal resolution passed by the Andhra Pradesh Cable TV Operators Association under pressure and directions from the newly formed government to permanently block several news channels,\" Reddy said. He alleged TV9 , NTV , 10TV and Sakshi TV were blocked 'without any lawful justification or procedural compliance.' Overwhelmed by a negative publicity onslaught over several years allegedly by rivals, Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy had established Sakshi newspaper and television channel around 2008 to disseminate a counter narrative. Meanwhile, a local multi-system operator (cable TV service provider) from the Godavari region confirmed these four channels were blocked. \"Yes, these four channels were blocked and this decision would have been taken at the management level and we have no role to play. The management does not consult us,\" the operator who did not wish to identify herself told PTI on Sunday. She observed the channels which allegedly took a supportive role to the erstwhile YSRCP government were taken off air while noting that the new channels currently being telecast include TV5, ABN Andhrajyothi and ETV . Except satellite television service providers such as Tata Play and others, the operator noted that most multi-system operators and AP FibreNet took these channels off air, which were allegedly viewed as pro-YSRCP media houses. The operator, who services up to 300 households with cable TV connections observed that the blockade began even before N Chandrababu Naidu took oath as the Chief Minister. Some of the blocked channels do enjoy high viewership in both the Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, prompting customers to question as to why they were not available. \"Customers will definitely ask. Why wouldn't they ask as to why these channels were blocked,\" the operator said, adding that a similar phenomenon did play out during the YSRCP regime between 2019 and 2024 in the form of the alleged blockade of some news channels such as TV5 and ABN Andhrajyothi . According to the operator, channels viewed as pro-TDP used to be available at an extra charge while channels viewed as supporting the YSRCP when it was in power were offered free, and things might have seen a reversal now. However, there is no clarity yet, the operator noted. The YSRCP Rajya Sabha member appealed to the regulator to conduct a thorough investigation and uphold the principles of a free and independent press by 'preventing undue governmental influence over media and broadcasting services.' Meanwhile, TDP spokesperson Jyotshna Tirunagari told PTI , \"the TDP always believes in the freedom of speech and we give a lot of respect to the press and media. And we always believe in journalism as a very strong pillar for the society and the state.\" She observed that the ruling party always accepts constructive criticism. Further, the TDP spokesperson highlighted that the first signature by the newly-elected Andhra Pradesh Speaker C Ayyannapatrudu on Saturday was to revoke the suspension on ETV, ABN Andhrajyothi and TV5 , channels which were allegedly barred from entering the House during the YSRCP regime. Moreover, she claimed the party does not categorise channels like 'ours' and 'theirs' as done by former chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy. #Elections2024"

The spurious liquor tragedy in Tamil Nadu’s Kallakurichi district has till now claimed as many as 56 lives, over 193 people have been admitted to various government medical facilities. “56 people have died and many are in critical condition. About 200 people are hospitalised.

The picture was taken when Radhakrishan visited her official residence and spent some time with her family. Many women writers and activists have shared the picture highlighting the social limitations still prevalent in Kerala over a man and woman hugging each other as a mark of respect. Sabarinadhan too shared the picture with a post saying that he was happy that the picture of a woman hugging a man in respect is being discussed positively now. Radhakrishnan had also received wide appreciation over his last decision - banning the use of the word 'colony' for tribal settlements - as SC and ST welfare minister. The Pinarayi Vijayan government's decision to give devaswom portfolio to Radhakrishnan, who hailed from the scheduled caste community, had also received much appreciation.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala Finance Minister K N Balagopal has called for a review of the central-state tax sharing ratio of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), and said that 60 per cent should go to the states, whereas it is shared equally now. Currently, the ratio is 50:50 and it should be changed to 40:60 in favour of the states, the minister said in the GST Council meeting held in New Delhi on Saturday, according to a statement issued by his office here on Sunday. Speaking about the significant issues addressed during the meeting, the state FM said a favourable decision taken with regard to the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) is expected to be greatly beneficial for Kerala. Generally, a GSTR-8 return is also required to be filed detailing the GST charges by e-commerce operators while doing business through e-commerce platforms, he said. It was decided in the meeting to include in the GSTR-8 return the details about the state to which the tax should go, along with the amount of tax, Balagopal said, adding that it is a crucial decision that is expected to benefit Kerala a lot. Those who sell goods and services from other states in Kerala through e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart collect IGST from the consumers here, but due to the non-specification of the consumer state in the returns submitted by them, Kerala is not getting the tax share, the minister explained. The new decision taken during the GST Council meeting will help to resolve this, he said. Kerala had sought a solution to this issue by listing out facts, which it found out through various studies, and the GST Council has accepted this, he said. During the meeting, Kerala made it clear that the issues in the GST system were the reason for the reduced IGST share that the state receives. The union government informed the meeting that the central revenue from IGST was also decreasing, he said. Based on this, it was decided in the meeting to check whether the reason for the reduced share was due to any lapse in the IGST system, Balagopal further said. It was also decided to re-examine the issue within 10 days with the participation of state GST officials, he said, adding that the loss of revenue can be checked only by identifying and fixing the problems in the system. Checks on all matters will be continued after the presentation of the union budget, and the next meeting of the GST Council will be held in August or September, the statement said, quoting the state FM. #Elections2024"

It is a \"financial plight\" artificially created by the Union Government; state Finance Minister K N Balagopal alleged. Replying to a question in the Assembly, he said the resource mobilisation initiatives of the state government were severely impacted as the Centre is treating the funds raised and spent by KIIFB as part of Kerala's overall borrowing. But the state government has not imposed any restrictions on granting funds to the projects sanctioned by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), he said. The KIIFB is a government agency in Kerala that finances infrastructure projects by raising funds from the markets. \"Kerala has been reeling under an acute financial crisis due to the anti-federal stand adopted by the Centre,\" Balagopal alleged. Despite all these adverse situations, the KIIFB could spend Rs 29,100 crore on various projects, the minister said. He admitted that KIIFB's activities were progressing at a slow pace now due to adverse factors, but rejected allegations that the execution of its projects was at a standstill. The Left government aimed at implementing infrastructure projects to the tune of Rs 50,000 crore through KIIFB. So far, 1,110 projects worth Rs 86,143.49 crore have been sanctioned by the board in various sectors, including tourism, transportation, education, IT, health, and so on, he added. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: Centre has imposed a stockholding limit on wheat for retailers , wholesalers , processors and big-chain retailers from Monday, to check the hoarding of the foodgrain and to ensure price stability, a senior official said on Monday. Single retailers, big-chain retailers, processors and wholesalers will disclose wheat stocks every Friday, said Union Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra in a press briefing here. Chopra stressed that \"I want to dispel the shortage of wheat in the country.\" He also noted that there is a ban on wheat exports as of now and there is no proposal to review a ban on export of sugar. He stated, \"We want prices of wheat to be stable.\" Chopra further informed that the stock limit for wholesalers will be 3,000 tonnes, while it would be 70 per cent of the processing capacity for processors. For big chain retailers it would be 10 tonnes per outlet with an overall limit for 3,000 tonnes and for single retailers it would be 10 tonnes, he informed. Chopra explained that the stock limit has been imposed in view of recent media reports that the prices of essential commodities are increasing including wheat. He pointed out that the stock limit has been imposed to reduce hoarding and noted that there are many tools (to keep a tab on retail prices) and stock limit is one of such tools. He also informed that the opening stock of wheat was 82 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) on April 1, 2023 while it was 75 LMT on April 1, 2024. He further informed that 266 LMT was procured last year, while this year the government has procured 262 LMT and procurement is still on. Therefore the shortage of wheat (in the opening stock) is just 3 LMT. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Patna: A CBI team from Delhi reached the office of the Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of the Bihar Police in Patna on Monday morning in connection with its investigation into the allegations of irregularities in medical entrance exam NEET-UG, officials said. The EOU, which had been investigating the matter until the Centre ordered a probe by the CBI, has arrested 18 people in connection with the case, they said. \"The CBI officers are collecting evidence related to the case from the EOU,\" an official said. The CBI had on Sunday filed an FIR in connection with the alleged irregularities in NEET-UG, which was held on May 5, on a reference from the Education Ministry, amid countrywide protests and litigations by students. \"The evidence collected by the EOU during the course of investigation include pieces of the burnt question paper recovered from a house in Patna, mobile phones of those arrested, SIM cards, laptops, post-dated cheques and reference questions papers provided by the National Testing Agency (NTA),\" an EOU officer said. \"All those arrested are in judicial custody in Patna, and the CBI team may take them to Delhi for detailed interrogation by obtaining transit remand from a court here,\" he said. The CBI is also likely to file multiple FIRs in connection with the matter to probe the destruction of evidence, and also register disproportionate assets (DA) cases against some of those accused who are public servants, he said. \"A DA case may be registered against arrested accused Sikander Prasad Yadvendu, a junior engineer in Danapur Town Council, as he reportedly acquired huge assets that are disproportionate to his known source of income,\" the officer said. Yadvendu, originally from Samastipur, has been identified as the prime suspect in the case, he said. \"He has a history of involvement in criminal activities. Before becoming a junior engineer in 2012, he worked as a contractor in Ranchi. He was previously implicated in an LED scam worth Rs 3 crore. He has served a jail sentence for his role in that case,\" the officer said. #Elections2024"

The tiger, identified as 'Tholpetty 7' was creating panic in Kenichira region, near here, killing four cows in two days. The animal had fallen into the trap set by the forest department on Sunday at around 11 pm, forest officials said. According to the officials, the tiger reached the cowsheds where it had attacked the cattle recently. It was caught in the trap kept there. The Forest Department has conducted preliminary health examinations on the wild animal and said it is suspected to have major health issues. Sources said it will not be easy for the department to let it in the wild as the tiger was not healthy enough to hunt for prey. The officials are also considering the suggestion of shifting the big cat to any of the zoos in the state after providing necessary medical assistance. On Sunday, the local residents squatted on the road and raised slogans demanding safety and protection for their lives and livelihoods. The protesters had also displayed the carcasses of dead cows in a vehicle. Amid mounting protest, the district authorities and the Forest Department had taken steps to trap the animal in a cage. They were also ready to tranquilise it if needed. Forest officials had also said that Rs 30,000 would be given as an advance of the solatium to the farmers who had lost cows in the tiger attack. The rest of the amount will be handed over to them after completing the post-mortem procedures on the carcasses of the cows, they had said. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Mumbai: As many as 16 senior leaders of the Mumbai Congress have demanded that its city unit chief Varsha Gaikwad be replaced so as to strengthen the organisation ahead of the Maharashtra assembly polls due in October this year. They feel that Gaikwad, who recently won the Mumbai North Central Lok Sabha seat, will not have time to work at the organisational level and have objected to her style of functioning, sources said on Monday. These leaders, in a letter dated June 16, have sought time from the Congress leadership to discuss rejuvenation of the party in Mumbai ahead of the assembly elections, and the Mumbai civic polls which are overdue. Signatories of the letter include Rajya Sabha MP and Congress Working Committee member Chandrakant Handore, former city party chiefs Janardhan Chandurkar and Bhai Jagtap, senior leaders Naseem Khan, Suresh Shetty, Madhu Chavan, Charansingh Sapra, Zakir Ahmed and Maharashtra Congress treasurer Amarjit Manhas. Most of these leaders have reached Delhi to meet Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and senior leaders KC Venugopal and Rahul Gandhi to discuss how to strengthen the party in the city, the sources said. A meeting related to Maharashtra is scheduled tomorrow. \"Recently, at a protest in connection with the UGC-NET exam chaos, Gaikwad did not call all party leaders at the city unit office. Hence, they had to stage a separate protest in suburbs,\" a source claimed. \"It is now 13 months she is the city unit head, but she has not spearheaded any substantial activity to galvanize the party cadre,\" the source further claimed. Mumbai North Lok Sabha seat's Congress candidate Bhushan Patil has also claimed he received no help from the city party unit. \"Patil has also complained that he did not get a lead in the Malad assembly segment (in the Lok Sabha poll) held by Congress MLA Aslam Sheikh,\" the source said. In the 2019 Maharashtra assembly polls, the Congress won only 4 of the 36 seats in Mumbai. During the recently-concluded Lok Sabha elections, the Congress bagged 1 of the 2 seats it contested in the city. #Elections2024"

Modi returned to power for his third consecutive term earlier this month. The prime minister and his Council of Ministers were sworn in on June 9. Follow LIVE updates from the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha This is his third term as a member of the Lok Sabha. Modi retained the Varanasi seat, which he has been winning since 2014. As the Leader of the House, he was the first one to take the oath. Modi took the oath in Hindi amid slogans of \"Jai Shri Ram\" raised by members of the treasury benches. Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah and Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari also took the oath as members of the 18th Lok Sabha. While Singh has retained the Lucknow seat in Uttar Pradesh, Shah returned from Gandhinagar in Gujarat and Gadkari from Nagpur in Maharashtra. All three took the oath in Hindi. Before them, senior members Radha Mohan Singh and Faggan Singh Kulaste (both from the BJP), who will assist the pro-tem speaker in administering the oath to the newly elected MPs, were sworn in as members of the new House. They will help pro-tem speaker B Mahtab run the House when the members take the oath on Monday and Tuesday. Congress member Kodikunnul Suresh (Congress), T R Baalu (DMK) and Sudip Bandyopadhyay (TMC), who were called to take oath as they were also appointed as panel of chairpersons like Singh and Kulaste, did not turn up to take oath. The Congress had taken objection to Mahtab's appointment, contending that the claim of eight-term member Suresh, a Dalit leader, was overlooked. The INDIA bloc has said opposition leaders Suresh, Baalu and Bandopadhyay would not join the panel of chairpersons as a mark of protest. Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Jitan Ram Manjhi and Minister for Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Rajiv Ranjan (Lalan) Singh also took the oath as members of the new Lok Sabha.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Kingstown: Afghanistan will watch the India-Australia clash with bated breath, hoping that the 'Men in Blue' stand on the winning side -- a result which will hand them a golden opportunity to qualify for the T20 World Cup semifinals when they take on Bangladesh in their Super Eights match. Afghanistan augmented their chances of making their first-ever World Cup semifinal when they downed the mighty Australians on Saturday. As things stand, India lead the group followed by Australia and Afghanistan -- both on 2 points each -- and Bangladesh are last. Rohit Sharma and his men are favourites to qualify for the final-four with a net run rate of 2.425 while Australia (0.223) have superior NRR compared to Afghanistan (-0.650). Rashid Khan and Co. will hope India do them a favour by beating Australia so that they enter the clash knowing exactly what they require to do for making the semifinals. But if Australia win, it will be an uphill task for Afghanistan to overtake the former champions on NRR. Having said that, Afghanistan will be super high on confidence having exacted revenge from Australia for their ODI World Cup loss last year in Mumbai. Irrespective of the India-Australia result, the Afghans would fancy their chances against a down-and-out Bangladesh, who seemed happy just to progress to the Super Eights. That Afghanistan have the skills and mindset to excel in the format is not up for debate. They have proved that they are no longer a side reliant on just their bowling unit to eke out victories. Openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz, the leading run-getter, and Ibrahim Zadran have set the tournament ablaze with their sensational hitting. Additionally, the Afghans are enjoying the conditions that the Caribbean pitches are offering. Having a plethora of quality all-rounders has only helped their cause. They will take on Bangladesh at the same venue where they defeated Australia and the spin friendly conditions will aide them. Bangladesh, on the other hand, have already given up. Although they do have a minuscule chance of progressing to the semifinals, back-to-back defeats against Australia and India have deflated their confidence. \"To be honest, I don't think we have a chance to play the semi-final anymore after this loss (against India),\" senior all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan said on Saturday. Bangladesh have struggled with their batting throughout the tournament. The lack of power-hitters has also hurt them. The underwhelming performance of opener Litton Das and Tanzid Khan has also compounded their woes. However, Towid Hridoy and leg spinner Rishad Hossain have impressed with their performance.The game against Afghanistan is an opportunity for them to end their campiagn on a high. \"But having said that, the next game will be an opportunity for us to get a win on our belt before we finish up this tournament,\" Shakib said \"We'd love to finish this tournament on a high. We have to face Afghanistan which is a very good side. So, we have to be at our best to be able to win against them,\" he added. Teams (From): Afghanistan: Rashid Khan (c), Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Ibrahim Zadran, Azmatullah Omarzai, Najibullah Zadran, Mohammad Ishaq, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib, Karim Janat, Nangyal Kharoti,Hazratullah Zazai , Noor Ahmad, Naveen-ul-Haq, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Fareed Ahmad Malik. Bangladesh: Tanzid Hasan, Litton Das, Najmul Hossain Shanto (c), Shakib Al Hasan, Towhid Hridoy, Mahmudullah, Mahedi Hasan, Rishad Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Mustafizur Rahman, Jaker Ali, Tanvir Islam, Shoriful Islam, Soumya Sarkar.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Mumbai: Passenger vehicle sales is projected to grow at a moderate 3-5 per cent this financial year on account of a high-base effect of FY24, shrinking order book and subdued demand for entry-level variants, a report said on Monday. According to the report by credit ratings agency CareEdge , following robust growth of 90 per cent with volumes at 90,432 units in FY24, with an improving penetration rate, electric car sales in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment is likely to clock volume of around 1.30-1.50 lakh units in FY25. In FY22 and FY23, the PV industry experienced substantial year-on-year volume growth due to pent-up demand post-Covid recovery and new product introductions, it said. Utility vehicles played a significant role, with volumes increasing by 41 per cent in FY22 and 33.2 per cent in FY23. The industry benefitted from lower interest rates and an increased desire for personal mobility in the wake of the pandemic, CareEdge said. According to CareEdge , utility vehicles contributed 10-15 per cent of total passenger vehicle sales until FY12. It grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.51 per cent between FY13 and FY24, as consumer preference shifted towards utility vehicles that offered better and innovative designs, new models, technological, functional and safety features. For the past decade, the utility vehicles segment has consistently outperformed the passenger vehicle industry growth rate. In FY24, for the first time utility vehicles sales volume stood higher than passenger cars and vans, it said. Currently, utility vehicles account for over 55 per cent of all new PV sales and its share in overall passenger vehicle (PV) sales is expected to further rise over the medium-term, CareEdge said. \"The PV industry is expected to exhibit moderate volume growth of around 3-5 per cent in FY25 on account of a high-base effect of FY24, shrinking orderbook and expectation of persistently subdued demand for entry-level variants in FY25,\" said Arti Roy, Associate Director at CareEdge Ratings. Strong demand for new model launches and SUVs coupled with the expectation of interest rate cuts in the second half of FY25 is expected to keep the sales momentum rolling, she added. However, in line with CareEdge Ratings' expectation of volume growth of around 7-9 per cent in FY24, the PV industry volumes grew by 7.4 per cent in FY24, the ratings said. This moderation in year-on-year volume growth in FY24 was due to the levelling off of pent-up demand amid a hike in vehicle prices, high base effect of FY23 and the high-interest rate environment, it said. Strong order book in FY24, robust demand for new model launches and increasing demand in the sports utility vehicle (SUV) segment kept the sales momentum rolling, as per the report. \"While the market for premium vehicles is predicted to thrive, driven by a surge in demand for luxury and high-end models, entry-level variants are likely to see continued diminished demand due to a downturn in both rural and urban markets,\" said Hardik Shah, Director at CareEdge Ratings. The rural sector is feeling the pinch as entry-level vehicles are becoming more expensive, whereas urban consumers are increasingly opting for SUVs, reflecting a shift in market preferences, Shah added. #Elections2024"

Responding to BRS MLA from Jagtial, Sanjay Kumar, switching loyalties to Congress on Sunday, Rao, who is working president of BRS, said the power of people is always stronger than the people in power. \"We have faced several defections of MLAs in the past in 2004-06 when Congress was in Government. Telangana responded strongly by stepping up the people’s agitation & eventually Congress had to bow its head. History shall repeat itself,\" Rao said on 'X'. The K Chandrasekhar Rao-led Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) suffered yet another setback on Sunday as Kumar joined the Congress. Kumar was welcomed into the Congress fold by Chief Minister and PCC president A Revanth Reddy, party sources said. He is the fifth BRS MLA to join the Congress. A doctor by profession, Kumar was elected to the Legislative Assembly for the second time. Kumar joining the Congress came close on the heels of senior BRS MLA and former Assembly Speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy switching over to the grand old party on June 21. Earlier, BRS MLAs Kadiam Srihari, Danam Nagender and Tellam Venkat Rao joined the ruling party. Besides these MLAs, several other BRS leaders, including Hyderabad Mayor Vijaya Laxmi R Gadwal, have also joined the Congress. There have been speculations that more BRS MLAs would join the Congress in the days to come. BRS had won 39 of the total 119 Assembly seats in the elections held last year, while Congress came to power with 64 seats. BRS MLA from Secunderabad Cantonment G Lasya Nanditha died in a road accident earlier this year. Congress won the recently held bypoll for Secunderabad Cantonment segment. This led to an increase of its MLAs to 65. #Elections2024"

The 40-member delegation reached Jammu on Sunday evening and flew to Kishtwar this morning for inspection of various under-construction power projects in the Chenab valley region, the officials said. This is the first visit by a Pakistani delegation to Jammu and Kashmir in more than five years under the dispute settlement mechanism of the 1960 Treaty. India and Pakistan signed the IWT after nine years of negotiations, with the World Bank being a signatory of the pact which sets out a mechanism for cooperation and information exchange between the two sides on the use of waters of a number of cross-border rivers. A three-member Pakistan delegation inspected the Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai hydroelectric power projects under the provisions of the IWT for the last time in January 2019, before the ties between the two countries froze following the revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. Immediately after landing at an army camp, the visiting delegation visited the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) headquarters, the officials said, adding they left for the 85 MW Ratle hydroelectric power project site at Drabshalla for dam inspection. They are also visiting the 1000 MW Pakal Dul hydroelectric project on river Marusudar, a tributary of river Chenab, and other power projects during their stay in Kishtwar, the officials said. Pakistan’s initial request to the World Bank in 2016, concerning its objections to the design features of the two hydroelectric power projects, sought a settlement through a ‘Neutral Expert.’ However, Pakistan later withdrew this request and sought adjudication through a Court of Arbitration. India, on the other hand, insisted that the issue should be resolved solely through ‘Neutral Expert’ proceedings. After failed negotiations, the World Bank appointed a Neutral Expert and the chair of the Court of Arbitration in October 2022. Issuing a notice for modifying the Treaty, India warned that “such parallel consideration of the same issues is not covered under any provision of the IWT”. In July 2023, the Court of Arbitration ruled that it was “competent to consider and determine the disputes set forth by Pakistan’s request for arbitration”. Pakistan filed its first Memorial, which listed out its legal case with documents, under this process in March this year. A month later, the Court undertook a week-long visit to the Neelum-Jhelum Hydro-Electric Plant in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir “to familiarise the court with general aspects of the design and operation of run-of-river hydro-electric plants along the Indus system of rivers. While India refused to take part in the Court of Arbitration, it submitted a Memorial to the Neutral Expert in August 2023. Pakistan joined the second meeting of the parties held by Neutral Expert in Vienna in September last year which discussed matters related to the organisation of the site visit. The Jammu and Kashmir administration has appointed 25 \"liaison officers\" to coordinate the visit of neutral experts along with delegations from India and Pakistan. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Ujjain (Madhya Pradesh): A university here in Madhya Pradesh has set up a probe panel following complaints of some students that a professor was propagating Islam and harassing Hindu students, a senior varsity official said on Monday. The professor has denied the allegations and said he will present his side before the probe committee. A dispute had started after some members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) accused Vikram University's guest professor Anis Sheikh of sharing material related to propagation of Islam on WhatsApp and harassing students of the Hindu community. The ABVP members also staged a protest in this connection on the university campus on Friday. Vikram University's Vice-Chancellor Akhilesh Pandey on Monday told reporters that after receiving a complaint from students, a committee has been constituted for the probe, looking at the seriousness of the issue. The committee will submit its report in 15 days, he said. Sheikh, the guest professor at the Institute of Pharmacy in the university, has been asked not to come to the department during the probe period, the VC said. When contacted, Sheikh told PTI that he has nothing to do with the WhatsApp group and the chat shared on it. \"It is the WhatsApp group of the department and the HOD (head of the department) is its admin. I have nothing to do with the chat. It was a year-old chat which was related to Ramzan greetings and was posted by a student,\" Sheikh said. After the post, a dispute occurred among students following which the HOD directed them to stop making such posts, he said. Sheikh also claimed that students who did not attend lectures were pressuring him to give them 80-85 per cent marks and the dispute which arose lately was after he did not give in to their demand. He said only three-four students belong to the minority community among 60 students in his class. Sheikh also claimed he was being pressured and his image was being maligned. \"I will present my side before the probe committee. The allegations against me are baseless,\" he said. ABVP's Ujjain mahanagar secretary Adarsh Choudhary told PTI that complaints against Sheikh were being received for a long time. He was awarding more marks to students of a particular community while harassing students of the Hindu community by giving them poor grades, Choudhary alleged. The ABVP office-bearer claimed his organisation got a screenshot related to a post on the institute's WhatsApp group about propagating Islam, a chat related to Roza, Ramzan and benefits of performing namaz. A Muslim student even offered namaz in a classroom, he claimed. \"We have given a memorandum over all such things to the vice chancellor,\" he added. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Amsterdam: Apple 's App Store rules breach EU tech rules because they prevent app developers from steering consumers to alternative offers, EU antitrust regulators said on Monday, a charge that could result in a hefty fine for the iPhone maker. The European Commission , which also acts as the European Union 's antitrust and technology regulator, said it had sent its preliminary findings to Apple following an investigation launched in March. The charge against Apple is the first by the Commission under its landmark Digital Markets Act which seeks to rein in the power of Big Tech and ensure a level playing field for smaller rivals. It has until March next year to issue a final decision. EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager cited issues with Apple's new terms. \"As they stand, we think that these new terms do not allow app developers to communicate freely with their end users, and to conclude contracts with them,\" she told a conference. The Commission said under most of the business terms, Apple allows steering only through 'link-outs', meaning that app developers can include a link in their app that redirects the customer to a web page where the customer can conclude a contract. It also criticised the fees charged by Apple for facilitating via the App Store the initial acquisition of a new customer by developers, saying they went beyond what was strictly necessary for such remuneration. Apple said it had made a number of changes in the past several months to comply with the DMA after getting feedback from developers and the Commission. \"We are confident our plan complies with the law and estimate more than 99 per cent of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created,\" the company said in an email. The EU executive said it was also opening an investigation into the iPhone maker over its new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app stores and whether these were necessary and proportionate. DMA breaches can cost companies fines as much as 10% of their global annual turnover. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : William Gallus For The Conversation Iowa: Heat domes, like the one sending temperatures soaring from the Midwest to New England and across the eastern US in June 2024, occur when a persistent region of high pressure traps heat over an area. A heat dome can linger for days to weeks, leaving the people, crops and animals below to suffer through stagnant, hot air that can feel like an oven. Typically, heat domes are tied to the behaviour of the jet stream, a band of fast winds high in the atmosphere that generally runs west to east. Normally, the jet stream has a wavelike pattern, meandering north and then south and then north again. When these meanders in the jet stream become bigger, they move slower and can become stationary. That’s when heat domes can occur. When the jet stream swings far to the north, air piles up and sinks. The air warms as it sinks, and the sinking air also keeps skies clear since it lowers humidity. That allows the sun to create hotter and hotter conditions near the ground. If the air near the ground passes over mountains and descends, it can warm even more. This downslope warming played a large role in the extremely hot temperatures in the Pacific Northwest during a heat dome event in 2021, when Washington set a state record with 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 Celsius), and temperatures reached 121 F in British Columbia in Canada, surpassing the previous Canadian record by 8 degrees F (4 C). Heat domes normally persist for several days in any one location, but they can last longer. They can also move, influencing neighbouring areas over a week or two. The heat dome that started in Texas and Mexico in June 2023 spread into the Southwest in July. On rare occasions, the heat dome can be more persistent. That happened in the southern Plains in 1980, when as many as 10,000 people died during weeks of high summer heat. It also happened over much of the United States during the Dust Bowl years of the 1930s. A heat dome can have serious impacts on people, because the stagnant weather pattern that allows it to exist usually results in weak winds and an increase in humidity. Both factors make the heat feel worse – and become more dangerous – because the human body is not cooled as much by sweating. The heat index, a combination of heat and humidity, is often used to convey this danger by indicating what the temperature will feel like to most people. The high humidity also reduces the amount of cooling at night. Warm nights can leave people without air conditioners unable to cool off, which increases the risk of heat illnesses and deaths. With global warming, temperatures are already higher, too. One of the worst recent examples of the impacts from a heat dome with high temperatures and humidity in the US occurred in the summer of 1995, when an estimated 739 people died in the Chicago area over five days.

According to a report by Science Times , the asteroid, named 2024 MK, is currently the constellation of Centaurus, some six million kilometres from Earth. Although that is a gargantuan distance, the asteroid is estimated to be travelling at a speed of 33,732 kmph, and is expected to make its closest approach to Earth in 10 years by next week. When it makes its approach, 2024 MK will reportedly fly past Earth at a distance of 296,119 km—closer than the Moon is to Earth (the average distance between our planet and Luna is 384,633 km). Currently visible below the horizon from Greenwich, UK, using long-exposure photography, the 2024 MK's fly-by next week can first be observed in the southern hemisphere, before it makes its closest approach to Earth. When it makes its closest approach to Earth, however, the asteroid will be visible in the northern hemisphere as well, reports Science Times. Is there a risk of impact? No. As per NASA, there is no chance of 2024 MK hitting Earth during this flyby. However, when the asteroid approaches Earth again in the year 2116, there is reportedly a 0.00000095 chance of a direct impact. How risky are asteroid impacts? There are innumerable asteroids both in the solar system and beyond, but they are not considered potentially hazardous unless they come within 7.4 million km of Earth and measure at least 460 feet in diameter. Asteroids of the aforementioned size can destroy entire cities and give rise to cataclysmic events at a regional level. As asteroid measuring around 650 feet, meanwhile, can take out an entire small country. If an asteroid measuring around a kilometre hits Earth, however, the impact could cause mass extinction and devastation at a global level. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Owerri: Well-groomed hair is a symbol of beauty for many black African women. Natural hair requires special care and attention, though, which can be time consuming. Wigs (human or synthetic hair), weave-ons and other artificial hair extensions offer women an alternative to their natural hair. In Nigeria, these alternatives are very popular with women, both young and old. The synthetic hair value chain is a big business worth millions of dollars and run by both local and foreign industries. Hairdressing salons flourish, providing styling and grooming services for women. But we’ve found that there are contaminants hiding in synthetic hair. Man-made fibres go through various chemical processes to make them look and feel more like human hair. The raw materials used to make some of the products are toxic. And the hair products are mainly made from plastics which are not biodegradable, which is harmful to the environment. In our study in Nigeria, we investigated 10 synthetic hair brands commonly worn by women. Some were made in Nigeria, others in China, Ghana and the USA. We found that all of them had different levels of contaminants such as silver, cadmium, chromium, nickel, vanadium and lead, including several pesticides which are hazardous to human health. Synthetic hair is usually worn close to the scalp. Women who wear it should be aware of the potential harm. Regulators should ensure that manufacturers of synthetic hair stop using plastic-based synthetic products and use natural plant fibres and protein blends instead. These hair fibres are biodegradable and free from harmful chemicals. Our study We bought 10 popular synthetic hair brands of various colours (Catherine, Eye Candy, Gold, Calypso, LVH, Dazzler, Mini Bob, Nectar, Diana and X-pression) from the Ariaria International market in Aba, in south-eastern Abia State. The samples were analysed in a laboratory. We used the US Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater to determine the presence of heavy metals (such as cadmium, zinc, lead, chromium, manganese, iron, mercury, copper and nickel) in the synthetic hair. We found heavy metals in significant amounts. One of them, lead, is used in stabilising the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) that the synthetic hair is made of. Lead compounds (such as basic lead carbonate, lead stearate and lead phthalate) prevent heat, light or wear and tear from breaking down the PVC, and make it easier to form into shapes. Lead is dangerous to humans, however. It affects the membranes, DNA, and antioxidant defence systems of cells. Lead also interferes with the normal development of a child’s brain and nervous system. The metals that are used to stabilise the polymer are not bound to it. They can leach out over time or when exposed to light. So, when women wear synthetic hair, whether as attachments, weave-ons or wigs, on their heads or as fake eyelashes, they risk exposure to lead and other heavy metals. This is the case for all synthetic hair brands made from plastics. In humans, exposure to heavy metals is associated with various biological risks such as damage to the kidneys, liver, lungs, reproductive system and nervous system. It has also been associated with cancer, skin irritations, asthma and cardiovascular diseases. We found also that the synthetic hair samples were contaminated with 11 chemical compounds which are pesticides. The levels of these chemicals found in the hair exceeded permissible limits, making them dangerous to health. Since they were present in significant amounts, we suspect they were used as a form of preservative by the manufacturers. We also found high levels of nitrate in the hair samples we studied. This has not been reported in previous studies on synthetic hair. Exposure to high levels of nitrate can lead to diseases such as cancer, enlargement of the thyroid gland and methemoglobinemia (a blood disorder). Why this matters Exposure to the toxic chemicals that we found in synthetic hair can have serious health consequences. Apart from damage to vital organs, they can cause infertility, birth defects, asthma, bronchitis and cancers. They also lead to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, endocrine system disruption and respiratory diseases, among others. People who wear synthetic hair should consider these risks, especially as chemical substances and heavy metals can be harmful even at low levels. Since Nigeria has large synthetic hair manufacturers in Lagos, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control should constantly review and evaluate the safety of the chemical ingredients used in making these products. Synthetic hair manufacturers do have other options. They can use high quality synthetic fibres such as hiperlon instead of plastic fibres. They should use fibres that are free from PVC and toxic materials, and opt for environmentally friendly ones. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: A 'simple' blood test could detect Parkinson's disease up to seven years before symptoms begin to show, according to research published in the journal Nature Communications . Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder, the symptoms of which include tremors, slowness of movement and gait, and memory problems. Using machine learning, researchers analysed blood samples of 72 patients having Rapid Eye Movement Behaviour Disorder (iRBD), in which they physically act out their dreams without knowing it. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence which learns from past data to make future predictions. The team of researchers, led by those at the University College London, UK, said that it is known that about 75-80 per cent of people having iRBD go on to develop an abnormal build-up of alpha-synuclein protein in their brains - also seen in people with Parkinson's disease. Upon analysing the blood samples, the machine learning tool, developed by the researchers, found that almost 80 per cent of the 72 iRBD patients had the same profile as an individual having ageing-related neurodegenerative disease. The researchers also tested the tool if it could predict the chances of the patient developing Parkinson's. For this, the iRBD patients were followed up for ten years. The researchers found that the tool correctly predicted 16 patients to develop the neurodegenerative condition and could do this up to seven years before the onset of any symptoms. \"By determining eight proteins in the blood, we can identify potential Parkinson's patients several years in advance. This means that drug therapies could potentially be given at an earlier stage, which could possibly slow down disease progression or even prevent it from occurring,\" said first author Michael Bartl, University Medical Center Goettingen, Germany. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Fort Collins: My parents said the planet is getting too hot for people to live here. They called it climate change. What does that mean?, asks a 12-year-old. Many countries have seen extremely hot weather lately, but in most of the inhabited world, it’s never going to get “too hot for people to live here,” especially in relatively dry climates. When it’s hot outside in dry places, most of the time our bodies can cool off by evaporating water and heat from our skin as sweat. However, there are places where it occasionally gets dangerously hot and humid, especially where hot deserts are right next to the warm ocean. When the air is humid, sweat doesn’t evaporate as quickly, so sweating doesn’t cool us the way it does in drier environments. In parts of the Middle East , Pakistan and India, summer heat waves can combine with humid air that blows in off the sea, and this combination can be truly deadly. Hundreds of millions of people live in those regions, most without access to indoor air conditioning. Scientists use a “wet bulb thermometer” to get a better sense of this risk. A wet bulb thermometer allows water to evaporate by blowing ambient air over a damp cloth. If the wet bulb temperature is over 35 C, and even at lower levels, the human body won’t be able to let enough heat out. Prolonged exposure to such combined heat and humidity can be fatal. During a severe heat wave in 2023, wet bulb temperatures were very high over the lower Mississippi Valley, though they didn’t reach fatal levels. In Delhi, India, where air temperatures were over 120 degree Fahrenheit (49 Celsius) for several days in May 2024, the wet bulb temperatures came close, and several people died from suspected heatstroke in the hot and humid weather. In conditions like that, everyone has to take precautions. Is it climate change? When people burn carbon – whether it’s coal in a power plant or gasoline in a vehicle – it creates carbon dioxide (CO2). This invisible gas builds up in the atmosphere and traps the Sun’s warmth near the Earth’s surface. The result is what we mean by “climate change.” Every bit of coal, oil or gas that ever gets burned adds a little bit more to the temperature. As temperatures rise, dangerously hot and humid weather has begun to spread to more places. Areas of the US Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Texas are increasingly at risk of dangerous hot and humid conditions in summer, as are heavily irrigated areas of the desert Southwest where water sprayed over farm fields adds moisture to the atmosphere. Climate change causes a lot more problems than just hot, sweaty weather. Hot air evaporates a lot more water, so crops, forests and landscapes in some areas dry out, which makes them more susceptible to wildfire. Each Celsius degree of warming can cause a sixfold increase in wildfire over parts of the western US Warming also makes ocean water expand, which can flood coastal regions. Rising sea levels threaten to displace as many as 2 billion people by 2100. All of these impacts mean that climate change threatens the global economy. Continuing to burn coal, oil and gas could cut global incomes by about 25% by the end of the century, according to one estimate. Good news and bad news There’s both bad news and good news about climate change in the future. The bad news is that as long as we keep burning carbon, it will continue to get hotter and hotter. The good news is that we can substitute clean energy, like solar and wind power, instead of burning carbon, to power the products and services of modern life. There’s been tremendous progress in the past 15 years in making clean energy reliable and affordable, and almost every country on Earth has now agreed to stop climate change before too much damage is done. Just as our ancestors built better lives by switching from outhouses to indoor plumbing, we will avoid making our world unlivable by switching from coal, oil and gas to clean energy. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Lancaster: The soaring demand for avocados in Europe and North America has led to a trebling of global production in just over 20 years. However, this popular fruit is increasingly controversial because of the environmental impacts of farming and distributing them around the world. These issues are not inherent to avocados themselves, which could still be a part of a sustainable, healthy diet. But rather they reflect some of the deep-rooted problems associated with their production. Avocados are native to Central and South America, where the warm, temperate climate provides ideal growing conditions. There are hundreds of varieties, however the one that most of us are familiar with today is the Hass variety, which can be traced back to a single tree planted almost 100 years ago. Part of the avocado’s rise in popularity over recent decades has come from its marketing as a “superfood”. While some health claims may have been overstated, they are indeed a good source of vitamins, minerals and unsaturated fats, which give them their satisfying, creamy texture. So why have avocados become so controversial? Like a lot of modern agriculture, most avocado plantations rely heavily on fertiliser and fossil fuels, contributing to rising greenhouse gas emissions. They have smaller yields than a lot of other crops and so have a higher carbon footprint per kilogram of fruit. On average, avocados have a carbon footprint of around 2.5kg of CO₂ equivalent (kg CO₂e) per kg – that’s all the greenhouse gases resulting from producing and transporting avocados, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, rolled into the CO₂ equivalent of warming. The carbon footprint of avocados is more than twice as high as bananas (0.9kg CO₂e per kg) and over five times higher than apples (0.4kg CO₂e per kg), although it is only slightly worse than tomatoes (2kg CO₂e per kg). But these figures are small compared to the global average carbon footprint of most animal-derived products. A kilogram of eggs has a carbon footprint of 4.6kg CO₂e, a kilogram of chicken comes in at 9.8kg CO₂e, and a kilogram of beef results in a whopping 85kg CO₂e on average. For those outside the Americas, the large distances avocados often travel may not be as big a deal as is commonly believed, at least in carbon terms. The vast majority of avocados are shipped, which is relatively low carbon because of the huge quantities that can be transported in a single voyage. Even when they are transported thousands of miles, shipping results in just 0.2kg CO₂e per kg of avocados, which is often much less than the footprint from growing them. Shipping does entail other issues. Over-reliance on shipping has created a food system that is vulnerable to shocks and disruptions, where logjams and logistical bottlenecks (for example, the blockage of the Suez canal by a container ship in 2021), famines or wars in one part of the world can lead to disruptions or food shortages in many other countries. The problem is likely to increase as the climate crisis deepens. This issue is not unique to avocados, but moving towards more locally supplied foods may build more resiliency and help protect against future food shortages. An environmental burden Avocado trees are very thirsty plants, requiring an average of around 1,000 litres of water per kg. This is higher than most other fruits and vegetables but lower than some cereals such as rice. The main issue is that avocados are grown in regions that are already water-stressed. Mexico, the world’s top avocado producer, is experiencing prolonged periods of drought, so irrigating avocado plantations may be undermining the local population’s access to water. This issue of fair water distribution could get worse in the coming decades. There are also impacts on nature to consider. Traditionally, avocado trees were planted in mixed plots with other crops and harvested as a subsistence food, with only the surplus being exported. This practice changed as demand from the US and Europe increased. Avocados are now primarily grown as an export crop, with production switching to large, monoculture plantations to maximise productivity. These monocultures have pushed out other native crops and are much more vulnerable to pests and disease than mixed planting. All this means greater volumes of pesticide chemicals and synthetic fertilisers need to be used. These, in turn, negatively affect biodiversity, soil quality and human health. Worse still, in some regions new avocado plantations are driving deforestation. As much as 25,000 hectares of forest are being cleared every year in the state of Michoacán, Mexico’s main avocado producing region that supplies most of the avocados sold in the US. Michoacán has rich forest cover that is home to several endangered animals such as jaguars, cougars and coyotes. Increasing avocado production in this region could therefore be a massive threat to biodiversity. Finally, there are the human impacts to consider. While the avocado trade can help the local populations by providing income for farmers, they are also the ones who are feeling the brunt of the environmental issues. In addition, avocado plantations have been linked to organised crime and human rights abuses, with some towns and villages getting so sick of the problems that they have outlawed avocados altogether. Frustratingly, there aren’t any easy answers. Looking for fairtrade or organically produced avocados might help in terms of the human and biodiversity impacts, but the certification processes are far from perfect and often too expensive for small-scale farmers in developing countries. They also may not result in lower emissions than monoculture plantations. Avocados aren’t the only food with an environmental burden. They have a much lower carbon footprint than most animal products and are just one of many crops where a single variety dominates the market. But neither should we dismiss the damage that avocado production is having on nature and local populations. The best advice for consumers may be to consider alternative varieties of avocado where possible to reduce the demand for monoculture plantations. Where these aren’t available, the next best thing is probably to try to keep avocados as a treat rather than a regular staple. #Elections2024"

The attack disrupted some government services, most notably at airports last week, though automated machines were now functional, the communications ministry said on Monday. Minister Budi Arie Setiadi said the attacker used a new variant of existing malicious software called Lockbit 3.0, without giving further details. The Lockbit cybercrime group is notorious for using malicious software called ransomware to digitally extort its victims. Ransom software works by encrypting victims' data. Hackers can offer a key in return for payments, typically to be made in cryptocurrency, that can run into the hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. If the victim resists, hackers can then threaten to leak or delete confidential data in a bid to pressure the person or organisation. Semuel Abrijani Pangerapan, an official at communications ministry, said digital forensics into investigation are underway and further details have yet to be found. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Ahmedabad: The Gujarat government on Sunday decided to hand over the investigation into the alleged multi-crore NEET (National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test) cheating scam in Godhra to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The Bhupendra Patel-led BJP government in a statement said that since CBI is investigating irregularities in NEET examination conducted on May 5, the government has decided to hand over the case lodged at Godhra Taluka police station to CBI for a thorough investigation. \"The investigation has been handed over to CBI under section 6 of Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. The state government has also issued a notification in this regard,\" the statement read. Meanwhile, the CBI in a release said that it has dispatched special teams to Godhra as well as Patna where local police have registered FIRs related to NEET cheating. The exam took place on May 5 at Jay Jalaram School in Godhra and three days later the FIR was filed. So far, the police have arrested five accused on charges of plotting to help at least 30 students in the competitive exam by solving their papers in lieu of Rs 10 lakh from each of them. The police found Rs 7 lakh in cash and cheques worth Rs 2.3 crore from the suspects, which are alleged to have been given to them by the parents of the students. On June 21, a district court in Godhra observed that \"malpractice seems to have taken place after the examination\". The court also criticised the National Testing Agency (NTA) for not helping the local police by providing answer-sheets to ascertain whether cheating was carried out or not. The local police claimed that cheating was averted after the district collector received a tip-off right before the examination and additional force was deployed at the centre. However, the court stated that the modus operandi of the suspects was to fill up answer-sheets after the examination got over and hence, a malpractice could have happened. The primary investigation revealed that \"particular OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) sheets were kept blank by the particular candidates/students, which were kept separately by the accused\". These answer-sheets were to be filled by accused Tushar Bhatt and Purushottam Sharma after the exams. Sharma was the principal of the school while Bhatt was working as physics teacher. They were also supervising the exams at the school which was one of the centres for the NEET exam. Investigation revealed that as part of the conspiracy, at least 30 students from Bihar, Maharashtra, Odisha among other states chose Jay Jalaram School as their centre. The three other accused have been identified as Parshuram Roy, alleged middle man Arif Vora and Vibhor Anand. #Elections2024"

Jaishankar visited the iconic BAPS Hindu Mandir in Abu Dhabi before the meeting with Al Nahyan, where the two leaders are expected to deliberate on the overall situation in Gaza besides bilateral relations. “Blessed to visit the BAPS Hindu Mandir in Abu Dhabi today. A visible symbol of India-UAE friendship, it radiates a positive message to the world and is a true cultural bridge between our two countries,” Jaishankar posted on X soon after the visit to the temple inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 14 this year. At the temple, the Minister interacted with the monks of BAPS, the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Sansthan, the organisation that built the temple on the land donated by UAE. Situated on a 27-acre site in Abu Mureikhah near Al Rahba, the BAPS Hindu Mandir, the temple is a stunning display of craftsmanship. Earlier in the day, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said Jaishankar's visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will provide an opportunity to review the entire spectrum of comprehensive strategic partnership between India and the UAE as well as regional and global developments. “During the visit, the External Affairs Minister will have a meeting with his UAE counterpart on wide-ranging issues of the partnership,” the MEA said in a statement. About 3.5-million-strong and vibrant Indian community forms the largest expatriate group in the UAE. The ties between India and the UAE have been on an upswing in the last few years. Following the landmark visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the UAE in August 2015, bilateral relations between the two countries were elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. Both countries signed a landmark comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA) in February 2022 to boost economic engagement. The trade pact provides numerous benefits, including the elimination and reduction of tariffs, fostering an open trade environment, and enhancing market access for service providers across various sectors. The UAE is also among the top four investors in India in terms of foreign direct investments in 2022-23. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Working round the clock to ensure enough numbers for the Lok Sabha Speaker post, the BJP, which had earlier deputed Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to build a consensus across parties including the Opposition and the allies alike, is also relying on Union Home Minister Amit Shah to bring on board some of the tougher NDA allies, especially the ones in Maharashtra. On Saturday, TDP supremo and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu told party leaders that Shah had called him to discuss the Speaker’s election. Naidu told his MPs that the TDP didn't want the post, rebuffing speculations that the party might demand the crucial post. \"Amit Shah called me on the election of Speaker. I told him that TDP does not want the post; our state only wants funds. The state is financially fragile and we need help,\" Naidu was quoted as saying by a party MP. Sources in the BJP said Shah has also reached out to the leaders of NDA partners in Maharashtra. A senior BJP leader said that conversations in Maharashtra have been successful, with the allies from the state assuring their support for the Speaker’s post. While several probable names were doing the rounds, a strong indication has emerged from within BJP circles that outgoing Speaker Om Birla will continue in the position. Last week, Rajnath Singh had reached out to other NDA parties as well as Opposition parties. Additionally, Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju has since talked to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Trinamool Congress’s Sudip Bandopadhyay, besides meeting leaders from NDA allies from the Northeast. BJP leaders said they were confident of keeping the Speaker’s post within the party’s fold since the numbers are stacked in their favour. Party sources said that the BJP was also keen to give the deputy Speaker post to the TDP, especially after the fracas over choosing the pro tem Speaker. It remains unclear whether the Opposition bloc will contest the Speaker's or Deputy Speaker's positions. While the Congress seems keen on a contest, not all I.N.D.I.A. bloc partners are on board yet. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Kolkata: Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee has conveyed to the top brass of the Congress that I.N.D.I.A. must go for the jugular of the coalition government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the very first session of Parliament, instead of waiting and giving it time to dig its heels in. Even as the Congress is in disarray in West Bengal after its alliance with the Left Front for the Lok Sabha elections failed to reverse its decline in the state, the grand old party’s top leaders reached out to the Trinamool Congress to ease the wrinkles in the ties between the two parties ahead of the first session of Parliament. The TMC supremo and West Bengal chief minister has conveyed to the Congress top brass that I.N.D.I.A. must mount the attack on the coalition government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) immediately both within and outside Parliament as the mandate of the recent Lok Sabha elections was against the regime led by Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. Banerjee is learnt to have told Congress veteran P Chidambaram that the Opposition should speak up against the BJP-led Government, be it on the issue of alleged manipulation of the stock market with the exit polls early this month, or on lack of attention on the safety of the railway passengers in the context of the recent mishap in West Bengal, or on the alleged irregularities National Eligibility cum Entrance Test – Undergraduate (NEET-UG. Besides, she also suggested that the I.N.D.I.A. must collectively demand the postponement of the implementation of the three new criminal laws and a parliamentary review of the laws as the Modi Government in its previous term had got the Bills passed by Parliament at a time when 146 opposition MPs had been suspended from both Houses. Chidambaram had a meeting with Banerjee during a short visit to Kolkata last Thursday. He apparently conveyed to the TMC supremo that the Congress’ central leadership would like to have better coordination with her party both within and outside Parliament to take on the BJP-led NDA government. He also assured the TMC supremo that the Congress would try to address her concerns over the allegedly ‘dominant role’ of the CPI(M) leaders in setting the agenda of I.N.D.I.A. and the opposition alliance would be run on the basis of equality and consensus, sources told DH . Banerjee, according to the sources, also sought the support of the Congress and other constituents of I.N.D.I.A. to her party’s demands for the release of funds by the Union government for the implementation of the development and welfare projects in West Bengal. With Banerjee’s bête noire Adhir Chowdhury no longer in the Lok Sabha, the TMC leaders hope that the coordination with the Congress in Parliament will be easier now. Chowdhury, the president of the West Bengal Congress Committee, was the leader of the party in the 17th Lok Sabha. He, however, lost in his pocket borough, Baharampur LS constituency, where the TMC’s candidate and former cricketer Yusuf Pathan won this time. The TMC, despite being a part of the I.N.D.I.A., went solo in the Lok Sabha elections. Banerjee blamed the leaders of the Congress and the Left Front in West Bengal for having a secret understanding with the BJP to beat her party in the Lok Sabha elections. Banerjee did not attend the meeting of the I.N.D.I.A. leaders in New Delhi on June 1, the day of the last phase of voting for the LS elections. She, however, did send her nephew and heir apparent Abhishek Banerjee to attend the second meeting on June 5, a day after the votes were counted and the results were declared. #Elections2024"

    "author_url": "https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti",
    "article_content": "Follow Us : Stacy Keltner For The Conversation San Francisco: Fifty years ago, scientists discovered a nearly complete fossilised skull and hundreds of pieces of bone of a 3.2-million-year-old female specimen of the genus Australopithecus afarensis, often described as “the mother of us all.” During a celebration following her discovery, she was named “Lucy,” after the Beatles song “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.” Though Lucy has solved some evolutionary riddles, her appearance remains an ancestral secret. Popular renderings dress her in thick, reddish-brown fur, with her face, hands, feet and breasts peeking out of denser thickets. This hairy picture of Lucy, it turns out, might be wrong. Technological advancements in genetic analysis suggest that Lucy may have been naked, or at least much more thinly veiled. According to the coevolutionary tale of humans and their lice, our immediate ancestors lost most of their body fur 3 to 4 million years ago and did not don clothing until 83,000 to 170,000 years ago. That means that for over 2.5 million years, early humans and their ancestors were simply naked. As a philosopher, I’m interested in how modern culture influences representations of the past. And the way Lucy has been depicted in newspapers, textbooks and museums may reveal more about us than it says about her. From nudity to shame The loss of body hair in early humans was likely influenced by a combination of factors, including thermoregulation, delayed physiological development, attracting sexual partners and warding off parasites. Environmental, social and cultural factors may have encouraged the eventual adoption of clothing. Both areas of research – of when and why hominins shed their body hair and when and why they eventually got dressed – emphasize the sheer size of the brain, which takes years to nurture and requires a disproportionate amount of energy to sustain relative to other parts of the body. Because human babies require a long period of care before they can survive on their own, evolutionary interdisciplinary researchers have theorized that early humans adopted the strategy of pair bonding – a man and a woman partnering after forming a strong affinity for one another. By working together, the two can more easily manage years of parental care. Pair bonding, however, comes with risks. Because humans are social and live in large groups, they are bound to be tempted to break the pact of monogamy, which would make it harder to raise children. Some mechanism was needed to secure the social-sexual pact. That mechanism was likely shame. In the documentary “What’s the Problem with Nudity?” evolutionary anthropologist Daniel M.T. Fessler explains the evolution of shame: “The human body is a supreme sexual advertisement… Nudity is a threat to the basic social contract, because it is an invitation to defection… Shame encourages us to stay faithful to our partners and share the responsibility of bringing up our children.” Boundaries between body and world Humans, aptly described as “naked apes,” are unique for their lack of fur and systematic adoption of clothing. Only by banning nudity did “nakedness” become a reality. As human civilization developed, measures must have been put in place to enforce the social contract – punitive penalties, laws, social dictates – especially with respect to women. That’s how shame’s relationship to human nudity was born. To be naked is to break social norms and regulations. Therefore, you’re prone to feeling ashamed. What counts as naked in one context, however, may not in another. Bare ankles in Victorian England, for example, excited scandal. Today, bare tops on a French Mediterranean beach are ordinary. When it comes to nudity, art doesn’t necessarily imitate life. In his critique of the European oil painting tradition, art critic John Berger distinguishes between nakedness – “being oneself” without clothes – and “the nude,” an art form that transforms the naked body of a woman into a pleasurable spectacle for men. Feminist critics such as Ruth Barcan complicated Berger’s distinction between nakedness and the nude, insisting that nakedness is already shaped by idealised representations. In “Nudity: A Cultural Anatomy,” Barcan demonstrates how nakedness is not a neutral state but is laden with meaning and expectations. She describes “feeling naked” as “the heightened perception of temperature and air movement, the loss of the familiar boundary between body and world, as well as the effects of the actual gaze of others” or “the internalized gaze of an imagined other.” Nakedness can elicit a spectrum of feelings – from eroticism and intimacy to vulnerability, fear and shame. But there is no such thing as nakedness outside of social norms and cultural practices. Lucy’s veils Regardless of her fur’s density, then, Lucy was not naked. But just as the nude is a kind of dress, Lucy, since her discovery, has been presented in ways that reflect historical assumptions about motherhood and the nuclear family. For example, Lucy is depicted alone with a male companion or with a male companion and children. Her facial expressions are warm and content or protective, reflecting idealized images of motherhood. The modern quest to visualize our distant ancestors has been critiqued as a sort of “erotic fantasy science,” in which scientists attempt to fill in the blanks of the past based on their own assumptions about women, men and their relationships to one another. In their 2021 article “Visual Depictions of Our Evolutionary Past,” an interdisciplinary team of researchers tried a different approach. They detail their own reconstruction of the Lucy fossil, bringing into relief their methods, the relationship between art and science, and decisions made to supplement gaps in scientific knowledge. Their process is contrasted with other hominin reconstructions, which often lack strong empirical justifications and perpetuate misogynistic and racialized misconceptions about human evolution. Historically, illustrations of the stages of human evolution have tended to culminate in a white European male. And many reconstructions of female hominins exaggerate features offensively associated with Black women. One of the co-authors of “Visual Depictions,” sculptor Gabriel Vinas, offers a visual elucidation of Lucy’s reconstruction in “Santa Lucia” – a marble sculpture of Lucy as a nude figure draped in translucent cloth, representing the artist’s own uncertainties and Lucy’s mysterious appearance. The veiled Lucy speaks to the complex relationships among nudity, covering, sex and shame. But it also casts Lucy as a veiled virgin, a figure revered for sexual “purity.” And yet I can’t help but imagine Lucy beyond the cloth, a Lucy neither in the sky with diamonds nor frozen in maternal idealization – a Lucy going “Apeshit” over the veils thrown over her, a Lucy who might find herself compelled to wear a Guerrilla Girls mask, if anything at all. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : By Roger Dargaville for The Conversation Melbourne: Peter Dutton has announced that under a Coalition government, seven nuclear power stations would be built around the country over the next 15 years. Experts have declared nuclear power would be expensive and slow to build. But what might happen to energy prices if the Coalition were to win government and implement this plan? How might we estimate the cost of nuclear? By 2035, 50–60 per cent of the existing coal-fired fleet will very likely have been retired, including Vales Point B, Gladstone, Yallourn, Bayswater and Eraring – all of which will have passed 50 years old. These five generators contribute just over 10 gigawatts of capacity. It’s probably not a coincidence that the seven nuclear plants proposed by Dutton would also contribute roughly 10 gigawatts in total if built. Neither my team at Monash University nor the Australian Energy Market Operator has run modelling scenarios to delve into the details of what might happen to electricity prices under a high-uptake nuclear scenario such as the one proposed by the Coalition. That said, we can make some broad assumptions based on a metric known as the “levelised cost of electricity”. This value takes into account: How much it costs to build a particular technology How long it takes to build the cost to operate the plant Its lifetime and very importantly, its capacity factor. Capacity factor is how much electricity a technology produces in real life, compared with its theoretical maximum output. For example, a nuclear power station would likely run at 90–95% of its full capacity. A solar farm, on the other hand, will run at just 20–25% of its maximum, primarily because it’s night for half of the time, and cloudy some of the time. CSIRO recently published its GenCost report, which outlines the current and projected build and operational costs for a range of energy technologies. It reports that large-scale nuclear generated electricity would cost between A$155 and $252 per megawatt-hour, falling to between $136 and $226 per megawatt-hour by 2040. The report bases these costs on recent projects in South Korea but doesn’t consider some other cases where costs have blown out dramatically. The most obvious case is that of Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in the United Kingdom. This 3.2GW plant, which is being built by French company EDF, was recently reported to be now costing around £34 billion (about A$65 billion). That’s about A$20,000 per kilowatt. CSIRO’s GenCost report assumed a value of $8,655 per kilowatt for nuclear, so the true levelised cost of electricity of nuclear power in Australia may end up being twice as expensive as CSIRO has calculated. Another factor not accounted for in the GenCost assumptions is that Australia does not have a nuclear industry. Virtually all the niche expertise would need to be imported. And very large infrastructure projects have a nasty habit of blowing out in cost – think of Snowy 2.0, Sydney’s light rail project, and the West Gate Tunnel in Victoria. Reasons include higher local wages, regulations and standards plus aversion from lenders to risk that increases cost of capital. These factors would not bode well for nuclear. In CSIRO’s GenCost report, the levelised cost of electricity produced from coal is $100–200 per megawatt-hour, and for gas it’s $120–160 per megawatt-hour. Solar and wind energy work out to be approximately $60 and $90 per megawatt-hour, respectively. But it’s not a fair comparison, as wind and solar are not “dispatchable” but are dependent on the availability of the resource. When you combine the cost of a mix of wind and solar energy and storage, along with the cost of getting the renewable energy into the grid, renewables end up costing $100–120 per megawatt-hour, similar to coal. If we were to have a nuclear-based system (supplemented by gas to meet the higher demands in the mornings and evenings), the costs would likely be much higher – potentially as much as three to four times if cost blowouts similar to Hinkley Point C were to occur (assuming costs were passed on to electricity consumers. Otherwise, taxpayers in general would bear the burden. Either way, it’s more or less the same people). But what about the impact on your household energy bill? Well, here the news is marginally better. Typical retail tariffs are 25-30 cents per kilowatt-hour, which is $250–300 per megawatt-hour. The largest component of your energy bill is not the cost of generation of the electricity; rather, it’s the cost of getting the power from the power stations to your home or business. In very approximate terms, this is made up of the market average costs of generation, transmission and distribution, as well as retailer margin and other minor costs. The transmission and distribution costs will not be significantly different under the nuclear scenario compared with the current system. And the additional transmission costs associated with the more distributed nature of renewables (meaning these renewable projects are all over the country) is included in the estimate. According to my back-of-the-envelope calculations, your retail tariff under the nuclear scenario could be 40–50c per kilowatt-hour. But if you are a large energy consumer such as an aluminium smelter, you pay considerably less per kilowatt-hour as you don’t incur the same network or retailer costs (but the cost of generating electricity in the first place makes up a much bigger proportion of the total cost). So if the cost of electricity generation soars, this hypothetical aluminium smelter’s energy costs will soar too. This would be a severe cost burden on Australian industry that has traditionally relied on cheap electricity (although it’s been a while since electricity could be described as cheap). A likely increase in energy costs in summary, in a free market, it is very unlikely nuclear could be competitive. But if a future Coalition government were to bring nuclear into the mix, energy costs for residential and especially industrial customers would very likely increase.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Nearly 166 million people worldwide are estimated to need urgent action against hunger, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a global partnership which measures food insecurity. That includes nearly everyone in the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli military launched an offensive in October following an attack on Israel by Hamas militants. More than one million of Gaza's inhabitants face the most extreme form of malnutrition – classified by the IPC as 'Catastrophe or Famine.' Seven-month-old Majd Salem is one of them. Born on Nov. 1, three weeks after Israel launched the offensive, the child was being treated for a chest infection in the neonatal ICU at Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza on May 9. The nurse caring for him said he was suffering from severe malnutrition. Majd was born at a healthy weight of 3.5 kg (7.7 pounds), said his mother, Nisreen al-Khateeb. By May, when he was six months old, his weight had barely changed to 3.8 kg, she said – around 3 kg less than would be expected for a baby his age. Majd, whose eyes keenly followed visiting reporters in the ward, had to be given antibiotics for the infection and fortified milk to boost his weight, his mother said. Reuters was unable to trace them after May 21, when the hospital was evacuated following an Israeli raid. One in three children in northern Gaza are acutely malnourished or suffering from wasting, according to the UN children's agency UNICEF, citing data from its partners on the ground. Ismail Al-Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run government media office, said their records showed 33 people had died of malnutrition in Gaza including 29 children, but added that the number could be higher. COGAT, an Israeli defence ministry agency tasked with coordinating aid deliveries into Palestinian territories, did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Israel's foreign ministry in late May issued a detailed statement questioning the IPC's methods of analysis, which it said omitted measures Israel had taken to improve access to food in Gaza. The IPC declined to comment. The plight of Gaza's children is part of a bigger trend. Globally last year more than 36 million children under 5 were acutely malnourished, nearly 10 million of them severely, according to the Global Report on Food Crises, a collaborative analysis of food insecurity by 16 international organizations. The food shortage in Gaza, while particularly widespread, comes amid a broader spike in extreme hunger as conflicts around the world intensify. Two other countries – South Sudan and Mali – each have thousands of people living in zones listed on the IPC website as facing famine. Another 35 – including Sudan, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo – have many people in the IPC's next-most acute category of food deprivation. The IPC, a grouping of United Nations agencies, national governments and non-governmental organizations, is expected to update its assessment of the picture in war-torn Sudan in coming weeks. A preliminary projection reported by Reuters earlier this month said as many as 756,000 people in Sudan could face catastrophic food shortages by September. Gaza's hunger crisis is also a product of war. The Israeli military invaded the Strip in response to the Oct. 7 cross-border assault by Hamas on Israel. More than 37,000 Palestinians and nearly 1,500 Israelis have been killed since then, Gazan and Israeli tallies show. The Israeli assault has destroyed swathes of Gazan farmland. In the early days of the war, Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza. It later allowed some humanitarian supplies to enter but is still facing international calls to let in more. The International Criminal Court's prosecutor, in seeking arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders, last month accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant of using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, among other alleged crimes. Netanyahu, calling that move \"a moral outrage of historic proportions,\" said Israel is fighting in full compliance with international law and taking unprecedented measures to ensure aid reaches those in need. Israel has accused Hamas of stealing aid, which Hamas strongly denies. Israel has also said any distribution problems within Gaza are the fault of the international agencies. Even when children survive, nutrition experts say food deprivation in the early years can do lasting damage. A child's brain develops at its fastest rate in the first two years of life. So even if they don't starve to death or die from illness due to their weakened immune system, children may face delays in growth and development, said Aashima Garg, adviser on nutrition at UNICEF for the Middle East and North Africa. \"While they may be alive, they may not thrive that well in childhood and beyond,\" she said. Three families in Gaza told Reuters about their day-to-day diets, and four global health experts explained how such deprivation affects the growing body. Damage done in weeks manifests over years, they said. \"It can have a long-term impact on their immune system, their ability to absorb good nutrition, and on their cognitive and physical development,\" said Hannah Stephenson, global head of nutrition and health at Save The Children, a non-profit. First Days Gaza has the most households globally in the most extreme stage of food poverty, according to the IPC, which classifies levels of hunger in five categories, the worst of which is famine. Households in North Gaza, where Majd lives, are already suffering a full-blown famine, Cindy McCain, Executive Director of the World Food Programme, said on May 5. It can take months for the international measurement system to declare a famine. But the first damage to a child's body is counted in days. Nine out of 10 children aged 6 months to 2 years in Gaza live in severe child food poverty, a UNICEF survey in late May found. This means they are eating from two or fewer food groups a day, which UNICEF's Garg said means grains or some form of milk. This has been the case since December 2023, with only a slight improvement in April 2024, she said. As many as 85% of children of all ages did not eat for a whole day at least once in the three days before the survey was conducted. The main cause of acute malnutrition in North Gaza is a lack of diversity in the diets of children and pregnant and breastfeeding women, according to a report in February 2024 from the Global Nutrition Cluster, a group of humanitarian agencies led by UNICEF. This deficient intake, both prior to and during pregnancy and breastfeeding, harms both mothers and infants. Abed Abu Mustafa, 49, a father of six, was still living in Gaza City in early April. He said people there already had eaten \"almost every green plant we could find\" and he hadn't had meat or chicken for at least five months. In Rafah in the south, Mariam, 33, a mother of five, has been living in a school along with two dozen of her relatives. She described a typical meal for her family before the conflict and what they are currently eating, shown below. Before the war, Majd's mother said an average family meal consisted of rice with chicken or meat, along with vegetables such as okra, cauliflower or peas. During the war, flour scarcity forced the family to make bread from animal feed. Recently, bread and canned goods like tuna and beans started to reappear, but these are not widely available. Unable to find food to feed herself and forced to flee Israeli bombardment early in the war, Khateeb said she had found great difficulty in breastfeeding Majd. She said she could find neither good quality baby formula nor clean water to mix it, so she fed him various types of powdered feed mixed with rainwater or brackish water from Gaza's polluted wells, causing diarrhoea. \"There is no chance to get proper food to have breastmilk, there is no meat, no proteins, no calcium, none of the elements that produce good milk for the child,\" she said. Garg, the UNICEF adviser, said the nutrition of breastfeeding mothers in Gaza was severely compromised, and with it their ability to produce milk. \"They are not eating fruits and vegetables. They are not eating meat. They are not having much milk,\" she said. This lack of nutrients translates into poor quality breast milk. Diluted formula is not safe and risks diarrhoea, which itself can be deadly. Moderately malnourished mothers can still breastfeed, with their bodies effectively sacrificing their own nutritional needs to save the child. But severely malnourished women struggle. Ahmed al-Kahlout, the nurse who heads the unit, said Majd's infection was due to malnutrition. \"There is no immunity, so any disease that the child catches in the shelters … afflicts the child with these severe lung infections,\" he said. Susceptibility to infections typically increases after two weeks with insufficient food. The body's consumption of its fat reserves eats away muscle tissue, which is why aid workers in the field use basic tape measures to assess the gravity of children's conditions. The tapes measuring Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) have been used for decades. If the upper arm's circumference is 11.5 cm (4 1/2 inches) or smaller for a child between 6 months and 5 years old, the child is assessed as having severe acute malnutrition, according to standards drawn up by the United Nations. MUAC screening data across Gaza since mid-January found more than 7,000 children aged 6 months to about 5 years were already acutely malnourished as of May 26, the United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA said. This is how that looks. Gaza has the most people at risk of starvation, but according to the IPC classifications, many millions are one step behind the enclave in food poverty. The IPC categorises the severity and scale of food insecurity and malnutrition. Readings of 3, 4 or 5 on the five-category scale require urgent action. Households in Phase 3 are in \"Crisis,\" the IPC says. They have high or more than usual acute malnutrition, or can meet their minimum food needs but only by selling assets or through crisis measures. Phase 4 is an \"Emergency.\" Households have either \"very high\" acute malnutrition and death rates or are only able to make up for the lack of food by taking emergency measures and selling assets. Phase 5 is \"Catastrophe\" or \"Famine.\" Households have an extreme lack of food and/or other basic needs and starvation, death, destitution and extremely critical acute malnutrition levels are evident. An entire area is only classified as in Famine if high food insecurity comes with certain levels of acute malnutrition and mortality. For the IPC, areas in Famine meet at least two of the following three criteria: * the area has at least 20% of households facing an extreme lack of food, * About one in three children there suffer from acute malnutrition, * Two adults or four children out of every 10,000 die each day due to outright starvation, or to the interaction of malnutrition and disease. The IPC report issued in March projected that the entire population of the Gaza Strip would fall into Phases 3 to 5 between March and July. U.N. officials told Reuters they expect the next IPC analysis on Gaza to be released on June 25. South Sudan and Mali are the other two other countries with households projected to fall into the same Phase 5 category as Gaza, based on the IPC's latest published analyses. Overall, the three countries with the largest numbers of people at Phase 3 and above are Nigeria (25 million), Democratic Republic of Congo (23.4 million) and Sudan (17.7 million), according to the IPC website. The IPC said its latest analysis of Sudan, conducted in December, was too outdated to include in the tables Reuters used for this chart. As a consequence of severe malnutrition, various complications arise. This is the impact of starvation after just three weeks. Like many children in Gaza, Majd's lack of adequate food dates back months. #Elections2024"

England began their quest for a first European Championship trophy with two tepid performances against Serbia and Denmark that drew flak from former players turned pundits Gary Lineker, Rio Ferdinand and Alan Shearer, among others. \"I always feel like they have a responsibility,\" the England captain said on Sunday. \"I know they have got to be honest and give their opinion but also they have a responsibility of being an ex-England player that a lot of players look up to, that people do listen to them and people do care what they say.\" Kane, who said he is fully fit amid speculation about a back injury that bothered him late in the Bundesliga season, took a swipe at the pundits by noting they never won an international trophy during their careers. \"I would never want to be disrespectful to any player, especially a player who has worn the shirt and knows what it is like to play for England,\" said Kane. \"(But) the bottom line is we haven't won anything as a nation for a long, long time and a lot of these players were part of that as well and they know how tough it is.\" Despite their sputtering start, England lead Group C on four points ahead of Tuesday's final group game against Slovenia in Cologne. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Delhi’s PVR Premiere, Saket, on June 1, was an unusual sight. It was nearly packed, and that was not for any new release. People came to watch a film that was released in 1976 — Shyam Benegal’s ‘Manthan’. The film created history by becoming the first restored film to be screened in 51 cities. Despite technical challenges in the original 35 mm film, like green mold, fungus, flicker problems, and lost sound, Film Heritage Foundation, a non profit working on conservation of films restored it successfully. Film restoration became popular in India in 2010, when the legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese’s World Cinema Foundation successfully restored Ritwik Ghatak’s ‘Titas Ekti Nadir Naam’. It had received huge traction. With ‘Manthan’ now, cinephiles hope for more such projects. The release of the film, 48 years after its initial release, amassed viewers of various generations. The restored print of the film looks neat, except for minor lulls with the sound and the print. ‘Manthan’ starts with Dr Rao, a veterinary doctor, (Girish Karnad), and his associates, who arrive at a village in the Kheda district of Gujarat. The primary occupation of the villagers is cattle rearing, and producing milk. Rao’s objective is to form a cooperative society for villagers that will be managed and owned by them. However, the process of forming a cooperative society becomes mired in village politics and caste division. His attempts to bring all the villagers on the same page fail. He also faces other challenges. Rao slowly wins the trust of villagers, and gets them a fair prize. But the resentment between the Harijans (Dalits) and upper caste, allows Mishra (Amrish Puri), a local dairy owner, to prevent villagers from uniting. Mishra makes sure the villagers continue to sell him milk at a meagre cost. Rao has to return without making any stride. The film very well captures the caste dynamics of rural society and how it takes primacy on everything. Smita Patil, who played the character of feisty Bindu, a mother of a child, and whose drunkard husband has supposedly deserted her, is remarkably interesting. The tension between her and Dr Rao, and their equation is portrayed well on screen. The melancholy of the last scene — when Dr Rao, before leaving the village goes to say goodbye to Bindu, and her husband does not let him meet her — was very well captured by the song ‘Mero gaam katha parey’, sung by Preeti Sagar. Smita Patil with her acting and beauty made it her own. All other actors, like the village head played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda and the rebellious Bhola, a fiery young man who resents the upper caste dominance in the cooperative society, played by Naseeruddin Shah, are very pleasing to watch. Benegal didn’t make this film a typical one with all hopes and a happy ending. The story is realistic and ends with a spark among villagers to form a cooperative society. ‘Manthan’ remained important in Indian cinema. It was made as a tribute to the milkman of India, Varghese Kurien. It shows the transforming potential a film holds. Around five lakh dairy farmers of Gujarat’s Kheda district contributed two rupees each, making it the first crowdfunded film. Its screening inspired more people to form collectives to sell milk. In May, the film was screened along with Akira Kurosawa’s ‘Seven Samurai’ (1954) and ‘Paris, Texas’ (1984) by Wim Wenders in the 77th Cannes Festival’s classics section. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : ​A health insurance policy is a must in these times of high costs of medical treatment. The twin advantages of insurance and tax benefits make this cover more cost-effective. Health insurance is a must for all today. There are two very good reasons why you need to ensure you have a health insurance cover for your entire family. The first and main reason is the rising cost of medical treatment alongside the state-of-the-art technology that is fast-changing its application. While you have the latest in both technology and medicines right here, they cost a lot of money. Any illness that requires hospitalisation will set you back financially if you don’t have insurance to pick up the tab. The second reason is the tax benefit that insurance gets you. Along with the insurance cover, a health policy is eligible for tax deduction. It is therefore prudent to use the policy as a part of your tax planning exercise and also bring down its effective cost. Sops on health insurance You can get tax benefits on a health insurance policy both for yourself and other family members – parents, spouse and dependent children. This gives you the option of security for the entire family along with a tax deduction that reduces your taxable income. In a way, the insurance comes with benefits given the tax advantage. This makes a health insurance cover a tax planning tool too. Here’s a glance at the tax benefits under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act 1961: Deduction allowed against premium paid for self, spouse, and dependent children – Rs Rs 25,000. * If parents are aged over 60 years an additional deduction of Rs 25,000 is available on premium paid towards their insurance. * In case you or your spouse, and parents, are aged over 60 years, the maximum deduction available under Section 80D is Rs 1 lakh. * Members of a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) can claim deduction under Section 80D against the insurance premium paid for a policy covering them. The deduction available is Rs 25,000 if the insurance is for members below 60 years of age and Rs 50,000 if it is for senior citizens. * Documents to claim tax benefits In order to claim the deductions available, you need to furnish a copy of the insurance policy and receipt for the premium paid. The policy should bear the names of all the family members covered in the policy along with age (more so in case you are claiming the higher benefit available to senior citizens). Apart from the names and age, your relationship with the insured persons should be mentioned too to ensure they qualify for the deduction available to a family. In addition, you will need a Section 80D certificate if you have paid the premium on a policy for your parents. Some norms that need to be followed It is crucial to bear in mind that the deduction is available only if the premium is paid in any form other than in cash. So, you need to ensure you pay through a cheque, NEFT etc and never in cash. Also, payments made towards preventive care health check-ups are also tax deductible. These payments can be made in cash. The deductible amount allowed for senior citizens can also be used for their medical costs. With careful planning, you can thus extend the tax benefits accruing from a single premium payment on a health insurance policy. Choose your policy carefully It is important to choose the policy you go in for and the amount you need to invest in it. Remember, a health insurance policy is not only a tax saving instrument. It serves two purposes – primarily covers medical treatment costs and also saves you some tax. Therefore, apportion weightage to these two factors accordingly while deciding on the policy and amount. If it is an individual policy, consider factors such as age, health condition, risk factors and other covers such as group insurance cover from your workplace. Here, you can plan your personal policy as a long-term insurance as every year the non-claim bonus will help you get a higher insurance sum, thereby building you a tidy sum by the time you retire and don’t have the office cover any longer. Many people don’t go in for a personal cover only because they have one from the organisation they are working for. This can be disastrous. In case of job loss or the organisation closing down, the individual is left out in the cold without insurance. Remember, buying an insurance in the later years is very expensive. If it is a family health insurance policy , choose an amount considering the healthcare needs of all members covered. Go in for a higher amount if you have more people in the higher age bracket. Ensure you claim the higher deduction available. * Buy peace of mind In this day and age, people need to be free of as many worries as possible. Expensive healthcare is definitely a worry. A prudent health insurance cover will give you that much-needed relief in case of an unfortunate health incident in the family. Some costs need to be factored in for sure. For example, there are strong possibilities of needs such as cataract surgery if there are senior citizens in the family. Preventive check-ups are a must for everyone beyond a certain age too. With the options in high-tech treatment these days, insurance is both an investment and ticket to good health. * * Standard T&C Apply Insurance is the subject matter of solicitation. For more details on benefits, exclusions, limitations, terms and conditions, please read sales brochure/policy wording carefully before concluding a sale. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Mammootty is sinister in this enigmatic tale of demons, dominance and death In simple words, ‘ Bramayugam ’ is the story of power dynamics and how it was used by tyrants from the beginning of time. At the receiving end are always the powerless. The film’s title points to the same. Bramam, in Malayalam, has different meanings — from orbit to obsession. Yugam means era. The film follows three men — the patriarch of a dilapidated mansion, the cook, and a paanan (an oppressed caste). The latter wanders into the mansion while attempting to get away from the atrocities of the slave trade. It is set in an era when belief in ghosts and witchcraft, and the practice of slavery were rife. ‘Bramayugam’ is full of ancient folklore references and powerful visual metaphors of destruction and tyranny. Thevan, the paanan (Arjun Ashokan) takes refuge at the mansion for a night. He soon realises that the mansion and its inhabitants are under the captivity of an evil force controlled by the patriarch (Mammooty). He loses track of time and events, and even forgets his name. It is chilling to watch him transform into an aged and fragile man in a matter of a few days. As the film progresses, more truths about the patriarch and the house are revealed. Only Mammooty can pull off characters as disparate as that of a gay man in a rural setting and a despicable patriarch with mysterious powers. Arjun Ashokan surprises as the paanan but Siddharth Bharathan stands out as the cook. The cook’s character, brooding yet calm, is extremely well portrayed by Siddharth. Art direction by Jothish Shankar is convincing and the cinematography captures the right balance of horror, mystery and despair. Songs by Christo Xavier evoke nostalgia. Overall ‘Bramayugam’ makes a lasting impression and anyone who is a fan of ‘Tumbbad’ should watch it. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The absurdity of parallel universes colliding makes for an amusing plot. In literature, this absurdity is left to the imagination of the reader. But bringing such concepts to screen can prove to be challenging. That’s probably one of the reasons ‘Saramsha’ falls flat in its narrative. Tejas (Deepak Subramanya), a brooding CA, is an aspiring writer. But he doesn’t get enough support from his parents and ends up taking a day job at a financial firm. He has no friends and is disconnected from reality. One day, he walks into another world through his bathroom door and meets people who don’t just become characters in his story but help him get out of his restricted space and mind. Surya Vashistta’s attempt at experimenting with surrealism and magical realism is a first in Kannada cinema. While the visuals are exhilarating, perhaps taking you back to a book you’ve read long ago, the experience gets diluted with too many dialogues which can at times come across as preachy. Deepak Subramanya’s compelling performance will make you feel empathetic towards Tejas’s character. But Surya Vashistta as Abhay is boring, with dialogues straight out of a Ted Talk. Sruthi Hariharan brightens the screen with her presence as Maya. When Tejas goes back to the past to alter circumstances, I was reminded of the ‘Dragon Ball Z’ manga series. A character named Future Trunks travels to the past on a time machine to alter it and change his future. But he soon realises that the future of this altered past unfolds in a different universe, and there would be no change in his current future. In ‘Saramsha’ as well, Tejas learns that the past cannot be changed. This part of the film especially amused me. I only wish the filmmaker included more subtle elements of surrealism to make it more intriguing. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Coco Gauff and Katerina Siniakova claimed the French Open women's doubles title on Sunday with a 7-6(5) 6-3 victory over Italians Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini - a day after the latter's crushing loss in the singles final. The win was Siniakova's eighth women's Grand Slam doubles crown and Gauff's first. Their makeshift pairing only came together days before the start of the French Open, after the American's regular partner Jessica Pegula withdrew from the tournament. \"Thank you Katerina for playing with me, we decided to do it two days before the tournament started,\" said Gauff, a doubles finalist at the 2022 French Open. \"It was very last-minute, I wasn't planning on playing doubles, so thank you for asking me.\" The first hour of the match was largely dictated by Errani and Siniakova's struggles on serve, as both were broken twice each, with the first set going into a tiebreaker. A quick start there gave Paolini and Errani a 5-3 lead, but Siniakova raised her game to win some key points that turned the tide in her and Gauff's favour. The Italians began the second set with real intensity, earning four break points in the first game, but Gauff and Siniakova battled back for a crucial hold before going up a break to take a 2-0 lead. That appeared to take the wind out of Errani and Paolini's sails, and though they were able to twice bring the second set back on serve, Gauff and Siniakova broke for a third time in the second to take a 5-3 lead. Gauff, who has often misfired with her revamped serve in recent months, showed no nerves when it mattered most and comfortably held on to clinch the win. Paolini, who suffered a 6-2 6-1 defeat to Iga Swiatek on Saturday, was left looking dejected. \"It's been two very intense weeks for me, very nice but very emotional,\" the 28-year-old said. \"I have a lot of memories and I can't wait to be back here.\" Gauff's win also earned her a measure of revenge on Paolini and Errani, who defeated the American and her Australian partner Erin Routliffe in the final of the Italian Open in Rome last month. Despite the defeat, five-times Grand Slam doubles champion Errani said her and Paolini's ambitions of winning the Paris Olympics were still strong, adding: \"We'll be here in one month. We have a dream, and it'll be special to play the Olympics in this place.\" #Elections2024"

IMD official CS Patil stated that a cyclonic circulation over northeast and adjoining east central Bay of Bengal persists between 3.1 and 5.8 km above mean sea level. A trough, or a low-pressure area at mean sea level, runs off southern Maharashtra-northern Kerala coasts. Lower-level winds are likely to strengthen along the western coast during the next three days. \"As a result of this, Coastal Karnataka and South Interior Karnataka are likely to receive widespread rains with isolated heavy rainfall in many places in North Interior Karnataka,” he stated. Orange alert The IMD has predicted extremely heavy rainfall in Uttara Kannada, Udupi, Chikkamagaluru, Hassan, Shivamogga and Kodagu, and issued an orange alert in these districts until Thursday, Patil said. Yellow alert Further, due to isolated heavy rainfall forecasts, a yellow alert has been issued for Bidar, Kalaburagi, Belagavi, Dharwad, Haveri, Mysuru and Chamarajanagar until Tuesday. The rainfall in the coming week across Karnataka is likely to be associated with thunderstorms and gusty winds. The IMD has advised fishermen not to venture into the sea until Wednesday on the Karnataka coast due to squally weather with wind speed of about 35-45 kmph, gusting up to 55 kmph. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Bengaluru: Bengaluru Police have trained five dogs from their ace canine squad to sniff out synthetic drugs, a move that is already bearing fruit in the fight against party-goers' narcotics of choice. While the dog squad is extensively used in drug cases, till now, they were trained only to identify traditional drugs such as ganja and charas. Now, with the new training, dogs can sniff out nearly 10 types of synthetic drugs, including methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and ecstasy pills. “Traditional drugs have become redundant. Now, many party-goers extensively use synthetic drugs. Hence, we experimented on training our dogs to sniff out synthetic drugs and it is bearing fruits,” Raman Gupta, Additional Commissioner of Police (East), told DH. He was instrumental in taking up the initiative to trains dogs for sniffing out synthetic drugs. The dogs exhibited their skills recently when the Bengaluru Police raided a rave party organised in Electronics City, where at least 86 individuals tested positive for drugs. “At the rave party recently, we were able to seize live drugs, which has not been possible in the recent past. Our experiment with the dogs showed success since it was these newly trained dogs that sniffed the drugs out,” Gupta added. The training The training team, which trained all the five dogs of the narcotic canine squad, plans to to equip all the new dogs that join the squad to identify synthetic drugs right from the beginning. Explaining the training process, Manjunath G D, dog squad inspector, said the dogs were trained extensively for three months. “Since these dogs were already trained for traditional drugs, we had to retrain them for three months. The handlers held practice sessions every day with the samples of synthetic drugs. After three months, the dogs were able to sniff out the drugs,” Manjunath said. Of the five dogs, four are German Shepard and one of them is a Belgian Malinois. The handlers trained the dogs using various search methods. “First, we make sure the dogs catch the smell,\" explained Vijayendra Babu, instructor to the dog handlers. \"Then, we train them for five types of searches: luggage/bag search, human search, ground search, vehicle search, and building search. In every type, we hide drugs and take the dogs around to identify them. After such intensive training, they can sniff out the drugs from any place.” While a few dogs wag their tail when they find drugs, others start barking, biting, or scratching the surface. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The year is 1934. The poet Osip Mandelstam has been arrested because his poem is said to be insulting to the dictator. Stalin calls his friend, Russian writer Boris Pasternak, to enquire about the arrested poet. What does Pasternak say? “We are different, Comrade Stalin.” A few hours later, rumours spread across Moscow that Pasternak abandoned his friend. In his novel A Dictator Calls, Ismail Kadare examines 12 accounts of this phone call, even unearthing KGB archives to reconstruct those three minutes. Kadare questions the authenticity of the accounts and motivations of the witnesses. Did Pasternak really betray Mandelstam? Pasternak’s integrity is questioned, and his complicity with the regime is touted around, even when he is seen as someone who is saving his skin. Kadare takes the role of an investigator tearing apart the accounts; he shows us that behind a singular vision of things hides a malicious intent to obscure the truth. Since the unreliability of these accounts is meticulously proven by Kadare, was it then pertinent to persecute Pasternak? Make one-sixth of the world hate him? At one point, Kadare even finds contradictions in the account of the most mythologised writer of Pasternak’s time, Anna Akhmatova. He is attempting a contrapuntal reading of that grotesque time where “things believable only in books and never in real life were giving way to things in real life that would not be believed in books.” The autobiographical novel (I hesitantly use the label ‘novel’ as all the conventionality of form and fiction are blatantly shifted by the writer in a way only Kadare can do) brilliantly showcases the effect of totalitarianism on the mental make-up of the artist. The artist’s motivations are questioned at multiple checkpoints, and his creativity bounded. The greater insult: his subject matter is dissected not to determine its artistic value but to see if his work shows any signs of decadence or dares to offend the regime. Casually and with utmost disregard, the literature is expected to narrate only one story, the class struggle, and reflect only one mood, the sunny optimism of Albanian socialist realism. Kadare compares himself with Pasternak in the novel, a comparison not far-fetched by any means. Kadare, like Pasternak, also received a call of his own from the dictator Enver Hoxha. He is often criticised for surviving the dictatorship. In an interview with the Paris Review, he says, “From 1967 to 1970, I was under the direct surveillance of the dictator himself… In such a situation I had three choices: to conform to my own beliefs, which meant death; complete silence, which meant another kind of death; or to pay a tribute, a bribe. I chose the third solution by writing”. He wrote the book The Long Winter in which he is accused of praising the dictator. But the writer doesn’t just see this fight for survival as a chase between cat and mouse. In a disturbing vision that only Kadare can accomplish, he subverts the dynamics of power. “The tyrant and the poet, however much they seem opposites, both held power”. Kadare, while subverting our understanding of binary opposition, is also interested in decoding the incomprehensible. The obscurity surrounding the phone call fuelled rumours that further villainised Pasternak. But it is impressed upon the reader that all methods of inquiry ought to be exhausted, all testimonies need to be questioned to dismantle the shaky edifice of truth. The relationship between writers and tyrants is not a narrative of the past. Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Pushkin are dying a new death in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Literature is constantly being reread, and new ways of consuming historical literature are being invented every day, courtesy modern discursive practices. In all this chaos, Kadare’s approach promises a shot at exposing falsehoods masquerading as truths. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Holly Black has triumphantly returned to the captivating world of Elfhame with The Prisoner’s Throne, the enthralling finale to The Stolen Heir duology. This follow-up spin-off delves deeper into the lives of characters readers were first introduced to in the author’s bestselling The Folk of the Air series. Oak Greenbriar, Jude Duarte’s younger brother from the original series, and Suren (affectionately known as Wren), the exiled heir to the Court of Teeth, continue their dance around love and power as Black masterfully reimagines these characters, stripping away their superficial facades and revealing complex individuals wrestling with morality and ambition. The result is a far darker tale than its whimsical packaging might suggest. In the place of playful barbs and youthful defiance, The Prisoner’s Throne is wrought with a heart-pounding struggle for power, rife with betrayals and fraught with difficult choices in the name of love. Secrets and burdens Picking up right where The Stolen Heir left off, The Prisoner’s Throne starts in the icy clutches of the North, where Prince Oak languishes in a frozen prison, the price for his betrayal of Wren, his former companion and the newly crowned queen. Despite their fractured bond, Oak yearns to save Wren from the emptiness of her own heart. Meanwhile, Jude simmers with fury over his capture and is determined to rescue him one way or another. Desperate to avoid war, Oak hatches his own counter-scheme, one that hinges on Wren’s volatile cooperation, which to his astonishment, comes forth. Trust though is a fragile thing in Elfhame. As they journey towards the capital, Oak clings to the hope of reconciliation, believing Wren will see the true him. Yet, Wren harbours her own secrets and burdens. Soon, Oak finds himself trapped between loyalty to his family and love of the girl who once understood him. While The Stolen Heir unfolded through Wren’s perspective, The Prisoner’s Throne offers a refreshing shift, narrated by Oak. This allows Black to explore the emotional toll of Oak’s journey and the impact of his past traumas within a protective yet stifling family. Black’s signature world-building shines once again and brings out the darkness of the characters. From the chilling landscapes of the North to the opulent halls of Elfhame with its perilous beauty and intricate political landscape, Black transports us to a world where magic and danger lurk around every corner. While the narrative focuses on Oak and Wren, fans of the Folk of the Air will be delighted by the return of beloved characters like Jude and Cardan. Their appearances, though brief, serve as a bridge between the two series. Black masterfully balances the need to give Wren and Oak space to develop as characters while also acknowledging the reader’s connection to the established world and its inhabitants. Complex family dynamics Beyond the political machinations and fantastical elements, Black’s portrayal of complex family dynamics is particularly poignant. The impact of childhood experiences, the difficulty of forgiveness, and the yearning for belonging are all relatable themes. The Prisoner’s Throne doesn’t shy away from the messy realities of relationships, making the story all the more compelling. This is a masterfully crafted conclusion to the duology. It offers a satisfying resolution to the central conflict while leaving room for further exploration within the world of Elfhame. Black’s signature prose is both captivating and sharp, keeping the reader enthralled until the very last page. Whether you’re a die-hard fan of The Folk of the Air or a newcomer to Black’s fantastical world, The Prisoner’s Throne is a thrilling adventure filled with unforgettable characters and heart-wrenching choices. The two books are strongly a part of the original series and will make much more sense for readers who are familiar with the world. There are many references to the original series that had me going back and forth between books trying to remember everything. Nevertheless, the duology would still work fine as a standalone series. I personally think The Stolen Heir and The Prisoner’s Throne read like one story split over two books and would be better enjoyed when read in quick succession. This captivating finale is a testament to Black’s talent for weaving complex narratives with relatable characters, all set against a backdrop of magic and intrigue. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : In ancient times, living in harmony with nature was common worldwide. However, as humanity drifted away from nature, there arose a need to recreate natural habitats in cities to allow people, especially children, to learn about wildlife and birds. The Assam State Zoo and Botanical Garden in Guwahati, approximately 6 km from the railway station, exemplifies such efforts. Established in 1957 and opened to the public in 1958, the zoo covers 175 hectares, and the botanical garden spans 82 hectares. The zoo hosts the state wildlife emblem, the one-horned rhino, along with 112 other species, including tigers and golden langurs, in spacious enclosures. Similarly, Van Vihar National Park in Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, lies on the city’s outskirts near the large Bhopal Lake, nestled in lush, forested hills. Recognising a similar need, the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department developed a dense forest area 12 km from Indore, the state’s largest city, into the Ralamandal Wildlife Sanctuary in 1989. Covering 275 hectares, it is named after the nearby village of Ralamandal. The sanctuary is divided into three zones: wildlife, tourist, and deer safari zones. Historically, the Holkar dynasty used this forested area for hunting, and atop a high hill stands the Shikargah, a two-storey red-brick building built in 1905 by Shivaji Rao Holkar for royal relaxation. The park offers tours in a single motor-driven golf cart, providing a thrilling experience as deer approach the cart for photographs. The deer have been trained to come close with a single call, allowing tourists to interact with them. Due to the lack of natural water sources, the forest department has constructed water reservoirs, supplied by nearby tube wells, to provide drinking water for wildlife and birds. Separate water facilities and umbrella-shaped concrete seating areas are available for tourists to relax and immerse themselves in nature. Near the entrance, the range officer’s office and an awareness centre with an auditorium showcase films and exhibitions about the sanctuary’s features and display fossils, as the area was once home to dinosaurs during the Mesozoic era. Ralamandal Sanctuary also includes a rescue centre with trained veterinarians to treat injured wildlife from nearby districts. The sanctuary’s main attractions are the abundant blackbucks, blue bulls, spotted deer, hyenas, wild boars, and jackals. It is a valuable resource for the people and students of Indore to connect with nature, just 12 km from the city. #Elections2024"

Upon the suggestion of my local police driver, I embarked on a visit to Asirgarh Fort, which held significant historical value and was a mere 20 kilometres away towards Khandwa. Impressed by the grandeur of the fort, I resolved to revisit it later. The opportunity presented itself when I had to attend a family function in Nashik. After a four-hour train journey, we reached Burhanpur in the early hours, checked into a hotel, and spent the first day visiting local tourist attractions. The subsequent day, we set off for the eagerly anticipated trip to Asirgarh. The journey to the fort began with a 20-kilometre drive followed by an uphill ascent towards the fort, situated atop a hill at an altitude of 850 feet. The road was in poor condition, indicating a lack of interest from the State Tourism Ministry in promoting this remarkable structure. Upon arrival at the massive wooden-cum-iron gate, it was evident that the fort had been well fortified in its heyday when it housed a bustling township with thousands of residents. The strategic location of the fort, offering a panoramic view extending up to a kilometre or more, made it nearly impregnable, thwarting even the attempts of renowned figures like Akbar to conquer it. Delving into its history, we discovered that the fort served as a gateway to the southern regions of the country. Legend has it that the fort derived its name from Asa Ahir, a wealthy individual who settled atop the fort after being granted permission by a Sufi saint named Hazrat Noman Chisthi. However, his benevolence proved fatal when Sultan Nasir Khan Farooqi took advantage of his hospitality, leading to the treacherous occupation of the fort. The fort’s current form dates back to the 15th century when it was rebuilt by Adil Khan II, covering an area of 60 acres with walls towering between 80 to 120 feet. Despite numerous attempts, including by Akbar during Sultan Bahadur Shah’s reign, the fort remained unconquered until 1601 when treachery facilitated its capture by the Mughals. As we explored the fort, we encountered various landmarks such as the Jama Masjid, constructed of black stone and believed to accommodate 1,200 worshippers. Nearby stood the ancient Mahadeo temple, built in Maratha style in the 18th century, housing a bell that produces a resounding sound with the slightest movement. Further exploration revealed spots such as the convict’s gallows and prison cells, where individuals like the revered freedom fighter Veer Surendra Sai were once held captive. The fort also housed ruins of British barracks and cemeteries, serving as a poignant reminder of its varied historical chapters. Despite its rich history and potential as a tourist attraction, the fort lies neglected and is rumoured to be haunted. However, with proper attention and investment from the Madhya Pradesh Tourism, it could be transformed into a thriving destination, benefiting both visitors and locals alike. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Saikat Majumdar’s latest The Remains of the Body (Penguin, 2024) is a great attempt at exploring the sexual tension between people who are distressed by societal conformity yet tend to fight it. Reading this work was an experience, which ignited a pursuit to assess the normalisation of queer desire in Indian literature. Majumdar, who teaches English and creative writing at Ashoka University, says that for him, the novel “was driven by a failed dream for pansexuality, of being attracted to all genders — though limited, in this particular story, to the male and the female.” The narrative power in disruptiveness Furthermore, it stretches the “erotic limits of male heterosexual friendship that’s shaped, among other things, by an intense awareness of each other’s growing, and ageing, bodies — from puberty to early middle age,” and asks what prevents that awareness from becoming sexual. He says, “I imagined the protagonist as a gay man trapped in a straight body — just the way we are sometimes trapped in a body that doesn’t feel right for us. My fiction is often driven by a disruptive desire; I feel there is an innate narrative power in disruptiveness. The perverse source of that power is the normative ideal of sexuality that society forces on us. That ideal serves the needs of the state and the market, but real human happiness comes from stranger, unexpected moments and relationships. Everything society calls queer is what defines us — the norm is just an abstract and absurd ideal. I realise now that this is also what this new novel does — by revealing the queerness of people who imagine themselves as straight, it tries to make queerness not only normal but also the defining impulse behind all genuine human relationships.” “Romantic and erotic friendship between women goes back a long way in Indian literature,” writes the author of On the Edge: 100 Years of Hindi Fiction on Same-Sex Desire (Penguin, 2023), Ruth Vanita in the introduction to her book. “It appears in the first Hindi short story, Rani Ketaki ki Kahani by Insha Allah Khan Insha (1756-1817), and is prominent in the 11th-century Sanskrit Kathasaritsagara, where women fall in love with women at first sight, and men with men, such life-long same-sex friends being termed swayamvara (self-chosen) sakha (man’s male friend) and sakhi (woman’s female friend).” Vanita’s scholarship is a testament to the fact that for aeons, the depiction and representation of such relationships have been the norm. However, such stories either linger in academic circles or are policed, preventing their socialisation to a wider audience. But it can’t be denied that stereotypical writings have always prevailed, too. Call a spade a spade Novelist and poet R Raj Rao, whose works have always pushed back against conformities, for example, observes why “socialising and networking in washrooms” doesn’t find adequate attention or isn’t explored much. The author of Mahmud and Ayaz (Speaking Tiger, 2024) notes that in “literature and cinema because of the prudish, conservative and Brahminical mindset of Indians that prefers painting a sanitised picture of things rather than staring at hard truths in the face.” He continues, “I can tell you from experience that the existence of dating apps like Grindr notwithstanding, washroom cruising even among the so-called educated gay men goes on, and is sought out for its immediacy. No amount of online cruising can replace it. As for the trauma-dumping that’s to be found in much gay writing, this is because many gay men use heterosexual love as a trope for shaping their own romantic and erotic life, rather than displaying the courage to branch out in new directions. But heteronormativity can never be a model for homosexual love. Homonormativity, though it exists, invariably comes up against a brick wall. It’s about time the gay community learns to call a spade a spade without worrying about social acceptance. As I have frequently said, moderate measures never work. Only radical ones do.” Why sanitise the dynamics? For the author of Cockatoo (Pan Macmillan, 2023), Yashraj Goswami, “the idea of queer representation in literature didn’t even exist in (his) imagination” while growing up. He never knew of any queer writer. Even though Oscar Wilde was taught in school, “the queer dimensions” of their work were never discussed. However, in cinema, he did observe that queer people “were always an object of ridicule; think of movies like Raja Hindustani or Jab Pyar Kiya Toh Darna Kya.” But “things have changed a lot since. Take Modern Family for instance. While I know it’s bashed for domesticising the queer and sanitising the queer couple dynamics, thanks to it I recently came out to my 12-year-old nephew, as I was able to explain to him that every human being deserves to be treated the same regardless of who they choose to love or have a family with.” To that end, he adds something, attempting to erase the hetero-queer divide: “When people ask about the genre of my book, I instinctively say human drama. I resist calling it a queer novel; it feels limiting somehow. I say it’s a novel with queer characters — much like life.” But representation also has other dimensions. Gender rights activist and author of The Yellow Sparrow: Memoirs of a Transgender (Speaking Tiger, 2023), which is translated from Manipuri by Rubani Yumkhaibam, Santa Khurai is “anxious around the (growing) visibility and representation of (queer literature) the way it is being framed” because for her there’s a “stereotypical format” that connects everything and it “fails to reflect (trans and queer) community’s joy and belongingness.” Additionally, such narratives are human-centric, ignoring “fables and long narrative poems” that help her “express personal and political in a lighter manner.” Criticising Sahitya Akademi’s step, she notes that “organising a separate conclave for trans and queer writers is not an ideal step to inclusion”, as it doesn’t put them as equals to heterosexual writers. Furthermore, “the need to reinforce the regional- and state-level Sahitya Akademi units to encourage LGBTQIA+ writers by including them in the annual literature festival” focuses on numbers. She emphasises that if few writers from the northeast region get published, then it doesn’t mean there isn’t enough talent there but signals a “lack of support and exposure”. The power of good writing Founder of Dislang‚ an online magazine featuring writings by disabled and chronically ill people, and author of The Grammar of My Body: A Memoir (Penguin, 2023), Abhishek Anicca notes how in the last decade “more queer people in the publishing ecosystem have helped draw attention to our stories.” Despite “gatekeeping, the industry is changing” but “there’s a long way to go as there’s a huge gap in terms of intersectionality. But as more stories get published, more people will be empowered to tell their own stories.” But Abhishek also emphasises that “a writer should be judged by their writing — queerness and disability can be reflected in it, but good writing is essential.” (The author is a Delhi-based writer who frequently reviews books and writes on gender.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : ‘What gives you life also kills you eventually.’ This paradox is at the heart of oxidative stress — the root cause of various lifestyle disorders, ageing and, ultimately, death. Superfoods can help manage it by offering significant health benefits. What is oxidative stress? Oxidative stress is the trauma your body sustains from excessive oxidation, a chemical reaction similar to rusting iron. For example, the cooking gas burns — oxidises — producing energy. Similarly, many bodily functions involve oxidation, the most crucial of which is burning glucose as fuel in all our cells. Without this, the cells of our body cannot get energy to power their functions: Ergo, no oxidation, no life. Just as a fire generates smoke, energy production in the body produces toxic chemicals causing inflammation. These virulent inflammatory agents are essential for health, as they kill pathogens, destroy toxins, help heal injuries and strengthen muscles post-exercise. However, when excessive and prolonged, these life-sustaining processes become destructive and start harming our bodies. How degenerative diseases begin For diseases to develop, something has to go wrong. Often, that trigger is oxidative stress and inflammation, causing several degenerative diseases, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, memory loss, Parkinson’s disease, fragile bones, arthritis, cancers and autoimmune conditions. For instance, diabetes results in high blood glucose caused by the ineffective use of insulin by body cells — a condition called insulin resistance — commonly driven by oxidative stress and resultant inflammation. Once initiated, it can take up to 15 years for diabetes to fully manifest. In Alzheimer’s disease, the brain is unable to form new memories. This occurs due to the presence of dead neurons in its memory centres, as waste products remain dumped around them. Once again, this malfunction is caused by oxidative stress and inflammation in the neurons. Symptoms usually become apparent 15 years after onset. Usually, we attribute distinct causes to such diseases — akin to blaming trees for wildfires. While different approaches are necessary to deal with a wildfire and these diseases, they require the same precaution: avoiding flare-ups. The body’s defence mechanism Why don’t we succumb to oxidative stress and inflammation soon after birth? The body is equipped with chemicals like antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, some produced internally, and others derived from food, which protect against these harmful processes. But with age, stomach acid production reduces, thereby preventing nutrient extraction. Their absorption decreases in the gut, and the production of internal antioxidants declines. These lowered defences pave the way for illnesses and ageing. Phytonutrients in superfoods Most foods give us calories, fibre, vitamins and minerals. Superfoods contain one more ingredient: phytonutrients. These potent plant compounds play many health roles, including acting as antioxidants and anti-inflammatories. By providing additional ammunition to the body to fight against oxidative stress and inflammation, they can help prevent lifestyle diseases and premature ageing. As degenerative diseases progress, oxidative stress intensifies their progression, and unlike malaria, conditions like dementia or cancer don’t heal on their own. By dousing oxidative stress, superfoods complement the medicines in treating such diseases. Some powerful superfoods are vegetables like carrots, spinach, beets, tomatoes, onions, carrots, moringa and Shimla mirch or bell peppers; fruits such as pineapples, pomegranates, jamuns, amla, oranges and papayas; and spices like garlic, ginger, saffron, cinnamon, clove and turmeric. Health benefits of superfoods Unlike medicines, which are specific to treating a particular disease, superfoods address the root cause of oxidative stress. Each superfood addresses multiple conditions. Ginger benefits in digestive disorders, cancer, heart disease, hypertension and diabetes, while beets have benefits for certain cancers and disorders affecting the brain, eyes and heart. The obverse is also true. Many hair and skin disorders are alleviated by aloe vera, amla, Shimla mirch, carrots, coconut and turmeric. If such a disparate group gives similar benefits, we may need to rethink how diseases are categorised. For fragile bones, studies have identified the benefits of garlic, ginger, cinnamon, tomatoes, Shimla mirch and green tea — all of which are poor sources of calcium and vitamin D. Let’s face it: Osteoporosis is an inflammatory disease, not just a calcium deficiency and those superfoods are packed with bone-protective anti-inflammatory compounds. How to use superfoods The responsible approach to using superfoods is to add them to your diet. If you plan to consume them for specific health disorders, get your doctor’s permission first. Some foods, like garlic, can increase the effect of your medicines, causing excessive bleeding when taken with blood thinners. Your doctor might advise that cinnamon cannot lower blood glucose, yet recommend avoiding it to prevent your blood glucose from stooping too low, which could lead to fainting. Listen to them, even if you realise that the two sentences are contradictory. Eating the same foods every day as drinking spinach soup daily can become boring and unsustainable. It’s better to mix things up by choosing a variety of fruits and vegetables. Some plant compounds in a fruit or vegetable are unique: jamboline in jamun, safranal in saffron, EGCG in green tea, bromelain in pineapple, betalain in beets, gingerols in ginger, curcumin in turmeric and umbelliprenin in hing (asafoetida). Each works slightly differently and offers a few unique benefits. Who should eat superfoods? Most people worry about their health only when something goes wrong. However since several lifestyle disorders take 10–20 years to develop, one should start focusing on their health in their 20s, rather than waiting for symptoms to appear in their 40s or 50s. Regularly consuming superfoods can help you maintain an active and disease-free life well into your older years. Superfoods are low-hanging fruits, vegetables, spices and herbs for both lifespan and healthspan.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : All that bitters is gold! Or so it seems in the Indian cocktail scene today. The last decade has seen the growing popularity of bitters — usually and preferably an alcoholic ingredient that has been around for centuries — primarily used in Western cultures for their medicinal properties and later in cocktails. Bitters were earlier only used in high-end hotels. This is where Yangdup Lama, 51, mixologist and co-owner of Sidecar, and Cocktails & Speakeasy in Delhi-NCR, got his first taste of a drink with bitters...at a five-star hotel in Delhi, where he was working in 1995 when he was 22. They were consumed with lime soda or ginger ale because it was a great way to keep the tummy safe, he recalls. But what struck a chord was that the bitters were so flavourful that just a drop or two could do magic. “Bitters have been my favourite because it does two things: Keep the sweet component away and give a punch of flavour,” he says. “Bitters made their way to India through the influence of British colonial rule, where they were used in drinks like the classic Gin & Tonic to combat malaria,” confirms Ravish Bhavnani, 38, co-founder of Fig & Maple, New Delhi, who’s been in the industry for 18 years. Mixologist Nitin Tewari recalls this flavoured concentrated form of alcohol becoming popular among bartenders to enhance cocktails when the Old Fashioned cocktail became popular. Everyone wanted the drink on their menu..a drink incomplete without bitters. Today, people often ask for their Gin & Tonic with bitters or request soda with bitters on the side during lunch. “Whereas using liquor makes the drink too sweet, fresh fruits make it too cloudy,” he says. What’s your favourite bitter? There are two types of bitters: those which are concentrates like The Bitter Truth or Fee Bitters that come in 100ml bottles. A drop or two (max 5ml) is used for flavouring cocktails or foods as it’s quite concentrated. And bitter aperitifs like Campari and Aperol, which are milder and can be a drink in itself. Aperol Spritz is a common combination with sparkling wine. Or, just mix it with orange juice, or soda depending on how much you can handle the bitter flavour. If you can, try it on the rocks. Negronis are popular today, and use gin, sweet vermouth, and bitters (Campari) in a ratio of 1:1. Take an Americano, and add sweet vermouth and Campari in the ratio 1:1. “This has a sweet and bitter taste, with the latter ruling. A splash of good bitter aromatic or flavoured like the chocolate ones or those with a flowery or herb tone works well in a Gin & Tonic. You can also use bitters in whisky soda,” says Lama, whose bars and brand make their flowery bitters with rose and jasmine, spicy ones, ginger bitters, chocolate bitters, and gulkand bitters. DIY bitters Even today, bitters aren’t easily available in India and you can’t have something on the menu whose availability is uncertain. So, while the likes of Tewari collect bitters during their travels, others have tried making their own versions. Like Bhavnani, an Air Force kid who got his first taste when he stole a sip from his parents’ lemon/lime and bitters drink, at the age of eight. His time in Australia exposed him to a wide range of bitters. “The flavour profile was so complex: a little bit of citrus, some earthy notes, and this surprising hint of spice that just elevated the whole drink,” says Bhavnani, who was hooked. Today. Fig and Maple make their own range: Nannari Bitters, infused with the earthy sweetness of Indian sarsaparilla, Palash Bitters made from the vibrant flowers of the flame-of-the-forest tree, Phalsa Bitters which have a tangy-sweet flavour from phalsa, Kokum Bitters which has the sour and slightly fruity taste, Ambade Bitters made from the tart ambade fruit and bring a punch of sourness. What works best for Prantik Haldar, beverage innovations head at The Bombay Canteen, is that bitters enhance other flavours rather than imparting their own. Haldar first came across bitters in 2008 at a supermarket in Chandigarh. He only tasted it in 2014 during his hotel management college days. “Celery bitters can be used to make an Old Fashioned more savoury or give a Bloody Mary an extra punch,” he adds. The Bombay Canteen started making their own bitters out of necessity. They’ve made aromatic bitters to replace Angostura for their Old Fashioneds: They mix aromatic, chocolate, and chilli bitters along with mezcal and honey for their Oaxacan-style Old Fashioned. They have made orange bitters for a less bitter, more citrusy note; celery bitters, as well as chilli bitters. “We realised it’s about creating a base flavour profile — bitter or floral — and then building it up with the desired flavours,” he says. The Dark Monsoon at The Bombay Canteen has dark rum, honey, ginger, ginger ale, and aromatic bitters. During the pandemic, Tewari made bitters at home. He took a base spirit (rum or gin) and added a masala teabag to it. He then added sugar to balance it out and left it for 2-3 days to get a dark-infused liquid. “The tea has tannins which gives it a dry mouthfeel and bitterness while the masala adds spice,” explains Tewari. But bittering agents can get tricky. Something like karela won’t work because it’s very strong and has a veggie flavour too. Roasted coffee beans, cacao bark and teabags work if you infuse them for a long time. “It should be used in a dried form because that’s when it tends to lend a stronger flavour. Add ginger or spices to infuse the flavour. In Delhi, neem is readily available, so we use that to make some bitters at Sidecar. Or even orange peel pith,” adds Lama. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Water management, conservation strategies and access to clean drinking water are burning topics today. In such a scenario, Rashmi Ghosh’s solo exhibition at Monalisa Kalagram in Pune, which delves into stepwells of India, assumes greater import. The exhibition, Mapping Stepwells: A Visual Narrative, focuses on stepwells as significant sites of architectural heritage that formed a rich water resource for local communities in ancient times. Ghosh presents photographs of several stepwells and mixed media works, along with extensive text that documents her journey to discover stepwells located in different parts of the country. As is widely known, stepwells are peculiar to the Indian sub-continent and located primarily in arid regions, where water tends to be scarce. These subterranean water reservoirs, found in large numbers in the western parts of India, are known as vavs or baoris/baolis in local dialects. They are characterised by steps leading to the water, thus ensuring access to groundwater throughout the year. Ghosh, a former chartered accountant with over two decades of experience in teaching finance, developed a deep interest in stepwells, albeit by chance. A few years ago, she visited Hampi. The water reservoirs here, called ‘Pushkaranis’, are splendid examples of the Vijayanagara style of architecture. Awestruck by their structural design, engineering and ornamentation combined with their functional aspects, and the fact that these were conceived and constructed several centuries ago, Ghosh began researching stepwells in extensive detail. It was impressive that water conservation and access were thought about in such great detail for centuries, she says. She has since visited numerous stepwells so far, located in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Her documentation journey has involved visits to some of the most popular stepwells such as the Rani ki Vav in Patan, the Sun Temple at Modhera, Adalaj near Ahmedabad, Toorji ki Jhalra in Jodhpur and Chand Baori in Abhaneri, all of which are well-known tourist destinations and have undergone extensive conservation and restoration. For instance, the Rani-ki-Vav stepwell at Patan, Gujarat, is listed as a Unesco heritage site. Built in the 11th century, it is a fine example of the Maru-Gurjara architectural style. Such architectural brilliance is found elsewhere too. However, there are thousands of other stepwells that are little known and are in a state of disrepair, with little information available about their origins. Many of these have unfortunately become dumping grounds, several are no longer accessible while others lie in ruins. Ghosh visited several of these lesser-known stepwells too, a few of which were in a terrible state. In general, each stepwell is unique to the region, with specific structural design and geometric patterns, based on the period of construction with the designs and motifs reflecting Hindu, Islamic and Indo-Islamic influences. Ghosh traces her journey while mapping these various stepwells across regions, while additionally chronicling their state of neglect. She has also begun compiling stories and folklore from the local communities, some of which have been presented as text narratives in the exhibition. Photographs from various stepwells, a video based on aerial footage of stepwells in and around Pune, and charcoal drawings of architectural sections which depict the iconography and motifs at the stepwells, along with text panels, form a large part of the exhibition. In addition, mixed media works are presented to depict their geometrical and structural designs. One hopes that this body of work draws attention to water conservation and creates awareness about the restoration of stepwells, which are sorely in need of preservation. The exhibition is from June 21-30 at Monalisa Kalagram, Pune. Disclosure: The exhibition has been curated by this author. Dab Hand is your artworld lowdown.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : It’s been a memorable spring in our otherwise quiet house — my brother and my parents are visiting us for a few days, and Pippi has been the apple of everyone’s eyes. The last time we saw each other was years ago, and as their arrival came closer, one question lingered in our minds: How would Pippi react when he saw them at the door? Would he recognise them? Would he instead bark? Your guess was as good as mine. While human lives seem to move slowly, the four years have been quite eventful for Pippi — he has moved countries and cities that barely have anything in common, survived stressful air travels, met new people and animals, and switched to a whole new routine. That’s a lot for a dog’s tiny brain, thought my human brain. When my family landed, I promptly warned my brother — who Pippi loves, adores and plays rough with — to be careful and take it slow. But brothers don’t listen, do they? Before I got to the door, unable to control his excitement, my brother unlocked it anyway and called out Pippi’s name in his signature style. In the past, whenever Pippi heard it, he responded with wild excitement — play bowing, wagging his tail like it’d fall off and running up to him. That evening was no different — as soon as Pippi heard his voice, he ran up to my brother, sniffed him all over and jumped in excitement like he always did. While the two indulged in furry love, my mind pondered about pets and their memories. How far in the past do our pets remember? Several scientific experiments on cats and dogs have shown us they possess short-term memory — tiny bits of information in the brain that are easily accessed. It’s what helps them remember where their water and food bowls are or even recognise you. In fact, you could test it yourself — try hiding a piece of their favourite treat under the couch a couple of times and see them sniff at that spot every time they pass it. A week ago, Pippi spotted a discarded cat tree, and now he makes it a point to go to that tree every day to sniff endlessly. That’s also short-term memory in action. Cats and dogs also have long-term memory, which they consolidate in their dreams as their brains sort and organise their daily experience during the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep stage. You can see the process in action when your pets twitch in their sleep, chasing an imaginary squirrel or sniffing an imaginary treat. Whenever Pippi has an exciting day at the park — chasing a squirrel or sniffing out a rat — he almost always plays it out in his dream. Long-term memory consolidation helps our pets learn a new trick or grasp a word. So, let sleeping dogs (and cats) lie! Until recently, scientists believed our pets, at best, have associative memory — where they associate a response to a cue. Ivan Pavlov called it classic conditioning and showed it through dog and bell experiments. Perhaps Pippi’s reaction to my brother’s call was classic conditioning in action? But that does not explain what he did with my parents — one sniff and he immediately seemed to know who they were! As it turns out, studies in the last decade have shown that our feline and canine pets have episodic memory — they can remember the who-what-when-where of an experience. If you have ever met a pet with a traumatic past, it’s not hard then to understand why it takes them so much time to heal — the brain does a great job at storing and accessing episodic memories. If our pets have such great memories as science claims, I’d love to dig into Pippi’s puppyhood to know what he went through, and that would explain so many things about how he sees the world today. Before I can do that, I need to know what his memory might look like — is it photographic like mine? Maybe not. Since cats and dogs rely on their sense of smell and hearing rather than vision, their brain might store their experiences as a string of scents peppered with distinct sounds. Until science can reveal it all for us, let’s try to make more memories with our furry pals because those will stay in both our brains, and someday, we can jog down that memory lane together! Tailspin is your monthly column on everything that’s heartwarming and annoying about pet parenting. The writer is a science communicator and mom to Pippi, a five-year-old rescued Indie, who is behind her drive to understand dogs better. She posts on X @RamanSpoorthy #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Baroda-based multimedia artist Komal Mistri spent three months in the enclosed spaces of a government and private hospital in Gujarat, where she witnessed a total of 42 deliveries. Many of these cases were unhappy stories. Documenting the process of childbirth, which has been ritualised and considered throughout civilisations as sacred and celebratory, Mistri captured the unspoken narratives that mark the transformation of a woman’s body and psyche in her just-concluded solo show titled ‘Come With Your Own Light’ at New Delhi. In the realm of the labour room consisting of spotlighted beds and surgery tools lies the tale of embroidered bodies bewildered about whether to feel pleasure in pain or pain in pleasure. Lying on the bed, contemplating her identity, the pregnant woman wonders about her dual and frustrated state of being. “Mistri guides us through the hallowed halls of the labour room where the mechanical and the human dissolve into each other. Each image is a whispered confession, a poignant invitation to confront complex societal norms dictating the natural process of childbirth and the woman’s agency,” said Bhavna Kakar, Founder-Director, Latitude 28, where the exhibition was held. From the beginning, Mistri, a mother to a son herself, has been creating women-centric art. She hopes her exhibition was able to build awareness and empathy. It took her a total of four years to complete, including the pandemic year and one more to find a place to display. Mistri’s practice includes churning out memories from the objects that inform her subjects’ everyday lives. Bottles of blood, placentas, scissors, stretchers and machines serve as symbols of the mechanised nature of the labour room and the almost apathetic treatment of the mothers-to-be. To capture such images is itself an act of revelation to the artist whose personal experience with childbirth and healthcare systems marks her artistic practice. With this documentation, Mistri has been able to capture complex emotions and difficult circumstances in women’s lives. Interventionist photographic works and found objects illustrate collective pain and deprivation. Like a family member, Mistri dons the role of a confidante, a listener to the woes and happiness of women in labour. The exhibit also delved into the possibility of forming an archive of emotions surrounding childbirth. A vast majority of women are deprived of proper medical attention and are forced to push the limits of their physical capacity when they go into labour. Further, the socio-economic conditions of rural India constantly thrust women into a gender-discriminatory struggle of enduring pain beyond their limits. Given that the subject of the exhibition is a heavy one, it received a range of responses from viewers. “People were intrigued by the intricate display of artworks, their immersive environment and the deliberate manipulation of space by the artist to transport viewers to the visceral landscape of a hospital ward,” said Kakar. “When the exhibition was running in Baroda, many young boys cried. Many of the women who saw it shared their own personal stories with me,” added Mistri. As an artist, Mistri primarily relates to the identities of a woman in the domestic environment where she constantly struggles to alter her personality according to her responsibilities, thus disregarding her right to a personal space. Her body of work uses altered and constructed imagery assisted with found objects that resonate with ideas of memory, identity and space. Her previous work was a chronicling of household chores using still-life paintings from houses and found objects. She plans to continue working on the same project in the future to explore the concept further and express it better. “When you go through a process continuously, you can capture its varying feelings with more depth,” she said. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : When I think deeply about the term disability, what comes to mind is not the list of ways the world has decided a person (in the context of this article, a child) can suffer mental, emotional and physical lack: What I feel instead is a dreadful sense of somehow not being enough. As if the entire world is a huge wall one keeps trying to climb and no matter how hard one tries, the jump to the other side is impossible: As if it has been pre-decided that this wall will somehow keep getting bigger and our bodies smaller, our minds unable to fathom where to seek a foothold or grip, our arms fragile and inadequate. I let this feeling stay with me. And sometimes, I imagine a different, unhappy ending for the 2007 movie ‘Taare Zameen Par’ which told the story of a dyslexic child caught in circumstances way beyond him. While it is a sensitive, heart-touching story where characters get second chances, support and love, I have often wondered at the less-happier endings that children with learning disabilities end up suffering in real life. School in general can be harsh and hyper-focused on performance. With lesson plans, schedules and tightly boxed teachers ensuring board scores and topper lists, there is hardly any consideration for children whose capacities may not fit the norm. The one-size-fits-all approach to education in most parts of India really leaves no wiggle room for children who cannot speak, read, calculate or write in the exact ways and speeds at which they are required to, or expected to, in classrooms. The mechanistic nature of our teaching methods reduces learning environments to race tracks where all machines must shine. Where is the room for the alive, differing, colourful beings that children are? What about those who also want to learn to climb, but slowly? It seems to me that what our world needs more than ever is parents and educators who hold lightly the importance of their own roles and who can learn to follow a child’s pace. Rather than wanting to direct how that pace is set, what our beautifully different children can benefit from is paying attention to what their pace looks and feels like and us learning how to honour it best. Is that easy? No. Is it possible? Yes. Knowing the basics In the context of learning disabilities, the Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI) defines learning disabilities as “a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes of the brain involved in understanding or using language, spoken or written, which may manifest itself in an imperfect ability to listen, speak, read, spell or do mathematical calculations. The term includes such conditions as perceptual handicaps, brain injury, minimum brain dysfunction, dyslexia and developmental aphasia. However, the term does not include children who have learning problems which are primarily the result of visual, hearing or motor handicaps, or mental retardation, emotional disturbance or environmental, cultural or economic disadvantages.” Specific Learning Disability or SLD is a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) and one of the 21 categories of disability included in the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. Children with learning disabilities have mild to severe difficulty organising and storing information in the brain, which consequently affects how they understand material or people. Learning disabilities are broadly categorised as affecting: Reading and language processing skills Number and mathematic skills Handwriting and fine motor skills Integration, reasoning and organising of thoughts and ideas. Some examples of SLDs are: Dyslexia: Persistent difficulties with reading and writing. Dyspraxia: Persistent difficulties with coordination and executive functions. Dyscalculia: Persistent difficulties with comprehension of numbers and mathematics. Dysgraphia: Difficulties with fine motor skills, commonly handwriting. Sensory Processing Difficulties/differences: Difficulty in processing information through the senses. These disabilities can occur alone or in different combinations in children, resulting in complex challenges and adjustment issues. Different establishments may differ on what constitutes a specific learning disability. To avoid confusion, one can simply remember that conditions like ADHD, SLDs, and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are part of a larger umbrella term neurodiversity that embraces the wide spectrum of neurological differences in people. Some neurodiverse conditions co-occur but learning disabilities can occur in people with no other behavioural markers that often accompany ASD or ADHD. So someone with ADHD or Autism could have a learning disability but it is not necessary that someone with a learning disability will be autistic. Some experts on child development like Dr Gabor Mate believe that neurodiversity is an adaptive mechanism where the genetic matter in a child’s brain evolves in response to nurture, care, safe environment or the lack thereof. His views are not widely accepted by the traditional scientific community but I believe they are important to consider if we are to build compassion towards children who may be different from the norm. Multi-pronged sword Dyslexia is by far the most commonly occurring learning disability worldwide and in India. It is possible that it is diagnosed most as it is perhaps the most easily recognisable or obvious. Factors like bilingual education make it harder for dyslexic children to cope. Often schools have two or three languages as teaching mediums. It is interesting that anxiety, difficulty concentrating and fear of certain subjects almost always accompany any learning disability. When there is a lack in the ability to read, write, calculate, appear coherent in ways that are socially acceptable and constitute popular notions of intelligence, a person is bound to feel afraid and limited. In that sense, in a world where the only mark of success or acceptability is the ability to climb huge walls, anyone who knows only how to swim, fly or simply float would be considered a failure. Learning disabilities often go undiagnosed for years, especially in India. The extraordinary pressure to do well at school that is also tied up with social success, lack of awareness in parents and teachers and lack of easily available diagnostic facilities, forces them to learn ways of coping. But imagine the distress of being stuck in an unfamiliar place without the tools everyone else has. This may be simplifying the many complexities of learning disabilities, but for the sake of understanding what it feels like, imagine the constant pressure, confusion and disappointment at not being able to understand, express or be understood by others through writing, reading or numbers, especially if long-term survival depended on these intellectual aspects. For parents, dealing with SLDs in their children can be a multi-pronged sword. First there’s their child who doesn’t fit into the norm set up by schools and society that claim to know better. This heightens the anxiety and emotional upheaval that naturally accompanies parenting. Then there is their own inability to comprehend what may be happening to their child. This is further amplified by shame and guilt as the surrounding environment considers any academic lack or slowness as absolute personal failure. The subtle differences between learning disabilities and neurodiversity can also make it difficult to get diagnoses and help. Furthermore, diagnostic assessment for SLDs is not easily available in India. Does this mean that as parents, we give up all hope of being able to support our unique children to adjust and thrive in this world? I don’t think so. As parents of children with SLDs, we will have to access reserves of inner courage that enable us to see through these socio-cultural misconceptions if we are to offer our children a fair chance. To put it simply, all our children may not be climbers. Some of them may be swimmers, and others, diggers or fliers or floaters. The natural world allows for abilities to overlap, coexist or stay isolated so beautifully. A frog can both leap and swim; a hippo can float, swim and run. Some birds only fly while others waddle and some can’t fly at all. The natural world has no awards. Here, all flourish to the best of their capacity and environment. I wonder if that may have something to do with animals not going to school. Help your kids thrive, not just survive Here are some ways you can support children with Specific Learning Disabilities (SLDs): 1. Pay attention to where and how a child struggles: The area of a child’s struggle at school, at least in the context of learning disabilities, can help us discern the nature of the disability, if it exists at all and if it exists in isolation or co occurs with another neurological condition like ADHD or autism. For instance, many children struggle with mathematics but not all have difficulty comprehending numbers or copying them in a way that makes sense. For some children, math is hard because there is not enough effort to teach it in a way that is experiential or connected to real-life issues. A lot of children who are not very good at the rote learning method can do very well with Montessori teaching methods that rely on doing rather than simply learning. However, a child who has dyscalculia or dyslexia will have functional difficulty in even reading the numbers or the alphabet right. They may be able to understand concepts through other visual mediums but the script itself will be a challenge for them. Furthermore, mental and behavioural challenges (anxiety, panic, fear or phobia of a particular subject or activity, resistance to school itself) can exist in children without the presence of any SLDS or neurodivergence but they almost always accompany both. It can be tricky to determine what is what. Parents who understand that it is not just about figuring out ‘what is wrong’ with their child but also about noticing all the contextual, environmental, familial factors that contribute to why our children are the way they are will be able to discern more. 2. Seek early diagnosis and intervention It may be useful to think of early diagnosis and intervention as a way to determine what can work better for your child, and what they might actually benefit from instead of forcing them to perform in a certain way. But diagnosis as a way to seek a comfortable label can often be limiting in its own way. The NIMHANS Specific Learning Disability Battery (NSB) is the only accepted assessment and certification to diagnose Specific Learning Disability (SLD) in India. When we seek early diagnosis and intervention, it is important that we look for professionals who can empower children and not just tell us what they cannot do. That can be hard to find when there is no standardised testing for SLDs and just not enough specialists around, especially in schools. But the presence of global online services is a welcome change and we can use that to see what fits our needs better. Early diagnosis can be especially helpful in equipping children and their families to adapt before phobias and anxieties around performance and chronic stress related to learning set in. The longer we delay seeking professional help, the more difficult it is to recover natural curiosity and flexibility in children. Families, teachers and schools can also adjust their expectations from children and support them better when there is help sooner rather than later. 3. Self-educate and learn Parenting tests our capacity to accept, encourage, love and forgive even in the most ideal circumstances. When circumstances are challenging, it is natural to feel limited, helpless and at sea. But we’re not as helpless as we feel we are. Especially not in this day and age when information is available at our fingertips and we can access different sources from the comfort of our homes. I understand that it is difficult to raise a child who can be easily misunderstood, ridiculed or worse, made to feel inadequate. However, as parents, we must protect them by doing what is possible. Please take the time to research diagnostic centres and private special educators; talk to their school to see how they can support you; join parent or educator support groups, which can give you a sense of community and direction. It isn’t enough to rely only on mainstream education systems that cannot accommodate children with special needs. 4. Try and let go of traditional notions of education Easier said than done but it just doesn’t make sense to hold onto an education system that came into being to train children to be efficient workers. The traditional school system is based on the principles of replication, obedience, discipline and rote learning. None of these work well for neurodivergent children or children with SLDs. Segregating children into age-based learning groups and exposing them to artificial learning materials doesn’t work for children who cannot think or operate in linear patterns. In fact, there is no specific age graph for when learning disabilities arise in children and most of them learn better in natural surroundings through sensory play and creativity. If we are to offer growth and learning opportunities to children in general and children with SLDs in particular, we need to reimagine our education system. Going back to age-old methods will simply limit them. To prevent that, our own fears around failure, disappointment and not fitting in need compassionate examination. Whether your child is a swimmer, a climber, a runner or a waddler, nothing can take away from the fact that she is meant to do the best her body and brain can. How she will do that will depend a lot on how we accept, love and encourage her. Resources to bookmark LD Explained is a guide to learning disabilities and ADHD, founded by Ketaki Agarwal.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Mumbai: Always carry a walking stick, torch and first aid kit when you go for trekking. Don’t go for selfies in risky locations. Watch out for landslides and boulder falls. Do not litter in forts, forests, or near water bodies. Keep nature clean. Walk carefully on slippery slopes and riverbanks. If needed, take help of professional guides. Looks simple, but often ignored. These are part of the exhaustive do's and don’ts issued by the Akhil Maharashtra Giryarohan Mahasangh (AMGM), the apex mountaineering body of the state. The guidelines have been issued considering the accidents that are reported during the monsoon in the Sahyadri ranges of Western Ghats. Credit: Special Arrangement. AMGM also runs the Maharashtra Mountaineers Rescue Coordination Centre (MMRCC) 24x7 helpline number (7620-230-231) for coordinating an immediate search and rescue operation required anywhere in Maharashtra, predominantly in hilly and remote areas. The list of dos and don'ts have been issued by AMGM president Umesh Zirpe, working president Hrishikesh Yadav and secretary Dr Rahul Warange. With the monsoon trekking commencing in Maharashtra, the notice is being circulated among trekking and adventure organisations and groups, school and college students, and social media platforms. “It is essential to undertake wandering in the Sahyadri during the monsoon, as the Sahyadri takes on an extremely enchanting form during this season. However, wandering in the monsoon should be done with utmost care, as the swift flow of streams, slippery rocks, floods, and intense rainfall need to be navigated carefully. Human life is invaluable, and during this season, human errors can be fatal. By avoiding recklessness and excess, and by taking care at safe locations, wandering can be enjoyed to the fullest,” said Zirpe. “During the monsoon in the Sahyadri, many tourists venture out for rain tourism. The Sahyadri during the monsoon offers an extremely delightful atmosphere. The entire Sahyadri becomes lush green, with mesmerizing waterfalls cascading down the hills. To experience this natural beauty, many tourist spots become crowded,” said Zirpe, a veteran mountaineer and director of Guardian Giripremi Institute of Mountaineering. “However, while wandering in the monsoon, it is essential to do so with great caution. The pathways in the Sahyadri become slippery due to the rain, rocks become slick, and with the increased flow of water in streams and rivers, the paths can become inundated. Sometimes, sudden heavy rains can lead to flooding, posing a danger to those in the vicinity. Therefore, it’s necessary to wander cautiously and avoid areas with steep slopes or near forts. Taking photos in such areas should be avoided, and one should refrain from directly entering the flow of heavy streams,” he said. “Adventure in the Sahyadri is a must, but it should never be reckless. Especially wandering during the monsoon or any other season should never be done alone. Many mountaineering groups in the Sahyadri are selflessly engaged in rescue operations. However, while carrying out these rescue operations, they are deeply saddened by the loss of life or the need to rescue those in distress,” he said. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : In A Firestorm in Paradise, translator and historian Rana Safvi forays into the world of fiction to narrate a timeless story, where love and revolution become one. In the introduction to the novel, Safvi writes that despite her frequent scholarly engagement with Delhi’s history, countless accounts remain “buried in archives, untranslated, if not lost to history altogether.” The novel is an attempt thus, she adds, to document the undocumented. In 1856, Bahadur Shah Zafar was ruling over an atrophied Shahjahanabad. The East India Company had taken over both the administration and economy, and the emperor’s glory was scaffolded on allowances from the angrez. In this landscape, the novel relates the story of Falak Ara, the emperor’s illegitimate daughter from a tawaif. Falak Ara’s mother dies during childbirth but she continues to live in the harem with her caretaker Mubarak. Safvi enchants the reader with her elaborate descriptions. At one point in the novel, Safvi describes Chandni Chowk as “a dowager who had endured the vicissitudes of time with her dignity intact.” Her previous works breathed life into stones, and her tireless research shines when she writes about the harem and the royal quarters within the Lal Qila. But she also adds charming textures and colours to other descriptions; Falak Ara is dressed in a “beautifully embroidered orange brocade angiya. Her muslin peshvaz was fitted at the top… flared panelled silk pyjamas and a diaphanous organza dupatta completed the ensemble.” Each of these descriptions measures the weight of time — how each object has made its own journey through trade routes to be used in Indian Mughal courts of the 19th century. In the opening scene, Falak Ara accidentally falls into the river while boating. As she flounders, a young salatin dives in and restores her to life. Through hazy alarm, she registers the salatin’s brazen courage and is smitten by his disarming beauty. The novel soars in its descriptions of longing and love, as Falak Ara and the young salatin, Mirza Qaiser, are intrinsically connected to, and daydream about each other… But they must circumvent a series of social restrictions to be together. Safvi edges around desire and its frustrating repressions with tasteful openness. This is, in part, also achieved by adding many songs, poems and shers that capture the characters’ emotional ranges and responses, as well as the cultural milieu. Some of the most iconic Shahjahanabad poets—from Dagh Dehlvi to Mirza Ghalib—feature in the novel. Enriched by research Safvi has spent a lifetime archiving, translating and restoring the histories of Delhi. Naturally, the novel is enriched by these years of research. Between the slow-burn love story that blossoms, Safvi finds gaps to take the reader through a guided tour of the old city. There is a wide and almost confusing range of characters in the novel. For all of its countless characters, however, the effect is clear: the novel is about giving a voice to the many lives and stories that populate the streets of old Delhi. Lives that historical records reduce to numbers and mere names. It is also, simultaneously, about registering the syncretism of that old world—a quality that seems to be at its most endangered in ours. Coexistence is the everyday reality of Shahjahanabad: “You can hear the temple bells mingling with the sounds of the prayers coming from the mosques.” Safvi shifts between interior monologues and thoughts too, and without distracting breaks, weaves in and out of multiple narratives ably. It is a treat to taste the local flavours of Hindustani when characters talk to each other. At one point, a character curses another by wishing that the devil may urinate on her. Similarly, through various epithets for the emperor and some other key characters, as well as famous proverbs that we continue to use, the novel brings alive the profound heritage of our shared languages. Falak Ara and Qaiser’s longings and desires foreground the first half, while the second half is mostly about the 1857 uprising. The rebel groups of purbias and telingas—mercenaries who mutinied against the East India Company—loot and desecrate the old city. One of the more lasting portrayals in the novel is that of the emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, who is often “engrossed in some weighty matters of metre and verse.” When the rebels demand his interventions to combat the Company Bahadur, Zafar describes himself, in Safvi’s dialogue, as a faqir with nothing to lose and no power—the truth of this statement is made apparent when his directives are unheeded during the war. The final events of the novel are relatively rushed. But perhaps such is also the nature of the events that had to be recorded. The 1857 revolt is a brutal reminder of the East India Company’s barbarous exploitations of and violence against the citizens of Shahjahanabad. Safvi tells it as it perhaps indeed was, when the streets around Jama Masjid were choking with dead bodies, and the old city smelled of death and putrefaction and blood for days on end. The colour of henna and the colour of blood resemble each other in the end, she suggests. While the final moments of the story leave the readers asking for more, this is a fine, engaging debut novel from a celebrated Delhi historian. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : In 1797, the year when Maryse Condé’s epic novel Segu begins, the African city after which the book is named “…was at the height of its glory…and it was feared as far away as Timbuktu on the edge of the desert.” The essence of Segu’s power and glory was war — and Condé’s work, published originally in French as two separate volumes, examines its varying fortunes through the lives of one family and its descendants. Slavery, colonialism, and the expansion of Islam to the western reaches of Africa are all woven through the story Condé tells. Condé was born on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe in 1937. It was only when she reached France in her late teens to complete her schooling that she went through a political awakening, getting exposed to racial prejudice, the history of the slave trade and post-colonial thinking. When she went on to teach in West Africa, she met revolutionary political figures and her understanding of power imbalances in the world deepened. She would go on to have a storied teaching career in the US but it took a while for her first novel to be published and it would take some more years before she tasted commercial success with the publication of Segu. It’s impossible not to be sucked into the world of Segu — the opening lines (translated into English by Barbara Bray) promise betrayal and drama in the pages that follow: “Segu is a garden where cunning grows. Segu is built on treachery. Speak of Segu outside Segu, but do not speak of Segu in Segu.” Those lines are from the song of griots, the traditional storytellers of the region and they haunt the mind of Dousika Traore, a close advisor to the king or Mansa. He’s a patriarch heading five families, including those of his younger brothers, and as the story begins, he has 10 legitimate sons, three wives and a concubine. His status doesn’t last long though — he’s swiftly cast aside by the Mansa and the rest of the court for betraying tribal loyalties. Two of Dousika’s sons, Tiekoro and Siga, secretly convert to Islam, an act that goes against the grain of their tribe, the Bambara, who practice the old ways and worship the old gods. A white man is spotted close to Segu and more countries surrounding the Mansa’s kingdom are “won over to Islam”. To keep the changes at bay longer and ensure that one of the leading families of Segu don’t perish, Dousika is advised by Koumare, the high priest, to send Tiekoro and Siga away to Timbuktu. Another of his sons vanishes when he goes off on a hunt. The family’s downfall seems precipitous: Dousika’s descendants are scattered across northwestern Africa. They experience slavery, violence, spiritual crises, heartbreak and worse. For long periods — the novel spans almost six decades — they are exiled from their home. Will they get back to Segu and will what they have experienced lead them to bring the winds of change there? As the story unfolds against seismic historical transformations, it’s impossible not to question the sincerity of some of the political actors (doubts that are as relevant now as they were in the 19th century). In the final pages, as yet another religious conversion is rumoured to take place, a character says:“Doesn’t it all disgust you… They’ll do anything to keep their empires — change their religions; fight one another and then exchange presents; do their best to slit each other’s throats; and then call themselves brothers.” When she passed away in April this year at the age of 90, tributes to Condé rightly called her a grand storyteller and one of the greatest-ever Caribbean writers. They also spoke of her clear-sightedness when dealing with the political realities of the world she wrote about. She was not one to romanticise its harshness — she preferred to look at its brutality and its corruption and lay it before the reader to say this is what it means to be human and to be alive. The author is a writer and communications professional. When she’s not reading, writing or watching cat videos, she can be found on Instagram @saudha_k where she posts about reading, writing, and cats.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : From what I could make out in the grainy Zoom video, American thriller writer Harlan Coben had at least eight notebooks piled higgledy-piggledy next to him. Later in the interview, he told me he carried them everywhere since he is a habitual scribbler — of ideas, thoughts, plots, character traits and everything else in between. Prolific is a word often used to describe Coben and with good reason. He has “35 or 36 or 37, I forget” books to his name and several of his bestsellers (Safe, Stranger, Stay Close, to name a few) have been adapted into TV series and films across many streaming platforms. He is also called the master of twists and turns with his books (and their screen adaptations) never not breathless, with every trick of the trade thrown in — from extraordinary murders to serial killings to dual identities and crimes passionnels. His latest novel, Think Twice, is the 12th in the Myron Bolitar series, Bolitar being your not-so-typical sports agent-detective, complex and unpredictable but not unlovable. Coben calls it his best yet and throws a challenge that the last chapter would “knock me out” and that I may also shed a tear or two, not at my failure to guess the ending but at the emotional upheaval he promises I will go through. He also chatted about his writing process, how to side-step formulaic writing in crime novels, and more. Excerpts from an interview When did the writing bug bite you? I was in college and it must have been 1982-83. I travelled to Costa Del Sol in Spain and worked there for a while as a tour guide for Americans. I really wanted to write a story about this experience, so I went back and wrote a terrible novel! Mind you, I had never written fiction before but that’s how it all began. What did you read as a child? I was a voracious reader. I do not know anyone who has become a writer without reading a lot. I remember reading a whole lot of Roald Dahl books, The Wrinkle in Time series by Madeleine L’Engle and the Narnia series by C S Lewis...curiously, I was never a fan of The Hardy Boys series, which was something of a rage then. You mentioned you do not much like classifying your novels as crime thrillers...why? People label the books I write as mystery or crime thrillers but I like to call them novels of immersion — the kind that you can take on a vacation where you would rather stay in your room because you want to know what happens next; you want to read five minutes more before you turn in and the next thing you know it is four in the morning! That is the experience I set out to give my readers. Do you ever feel like an imposter? If so, how do you handle it? Oh, I felt like an imposter just yesterday! It never goes away...I do think only bad writers think they are good while the rest of us constantly feel like we are a mess. It is this feeling of insecurity, the infamous Imposter Syndrome that inspires you to write better — you need that angst, that doubt to go on. But it is also a contradiction — you think you stink as a writer but you also have the hubris to write a 500-page novel and expect people to pay to read it! What’s your writing process? Isn’t mystery writing always in danger of becoming formulaic? If there is a formula, I have not found it yet. Some call me the suburban thriller guy...I do not think that is true. I have written a fairly wide range of books — with female leads, male leads, first person, multiple viewpoints...you name it. I look at crime fiction as a form, not a genre. My books are as much about emotional resonance as they are about mysteries. As for the writing process, I like writing in hired cabs; I used to take share-rides just to write! I write around 30-40 pages a day and when in the mood, I can go on for 24 hours! What’s your next project? I am writing the follow-up book for Think Twice and working on a few series for streaming platforms. There is also the possibility of adapting the Myron Bolitar books into an American television series. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Celebrated author Vikram Seth has come out with a translation of the Hanuman Chalisa, his first new work in over a decade. The Hanuman Chalisa by Tulsidas is one of the best-loved hymns and poems ever. Many millions recite it by heart—in times of joy or sorrow, success or distress, and when they need courage. Its words and music are designed to lift the spirits of both the believer and non-believer. Vikram Seth—as acclaimed and popular a poet as he is a novelist—spent some years translating this beloved classic into English, in rhyme and metre. The result is a translation with the original Awadhi’s magical incantatory quality. This is the first-ever literary translation of the Chalisa. The bilingual edition has the original verses in Devanagari and Roman script alongside the English translations. It also features title calligraphy by the author. Vikram Seth is the author of three novels—The Golden Gate (a novel in verse), A Suitable Boy and An Equal Music—which are widely regarded as modern classics—and two works of non-fiction. He has also written seven books of poetry, including the bestselling All You Who Sleep Tonight and Beastly Tales from Here and There. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The 2024 Lok Sabha elections proved to be a closely contested affair. While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged victorious with 240 seats, they did so with a marked decline from their dominant performances in 2014 (282 seats) and 2019 (303 seats), suggesting a diminishing public appeal and a growing appetite for change on the part of the electorate. The widespread inaccuracy of exit polls further underscored the limitations of political punditry, as pronouncements of a “400-seat victory” for the BJP proved to be wildly off the mark. And yet, with the National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) ultimate victory, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is now poised for a historic third term. However, a crucial question looms: what does this outcome portend for the future of LGBTQ+ rights in India? In the weeks leading up to the elections, the BJP government notified the constitution of a committee headed by the cabinet secretary and comprising secretaries from the ministries of home, law, women and child development, health and family welfare, and social justice and empowerment to “examine the various issues relating to the queer community.” This was in line with the Supreme Court of India’s directions in the 2023 marriage equality case. In it, the Supreme Court declined to recognise queer marriages, instead directing the union government to constitute a high-powered committee to deliberate on the issues put forth by the community and come forward with solutions to assuage their concerns. While the formation of this committee is a welcome step, it is disappointing that neither civil unions nor marriage equality are explicitly listed on the agenda. Moreover, the fact that the same government that vociferously opposed marriage equality in the Supreme Court is once again in power is also concerning. In consonance with modern times? LGBTQ+ activists should note that this is the same government that is keen to introduce a Uniform Civil Code in the country. Their 2024 election manifesto clearly states: “BJP believes that there cannot be gender equality till such time Bharat adopts a Uniform Civil Code, which protects the rights of all women, and the BJP reiterates its stand to draw a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), drawing upon the best traditions and harmonising them with modern times.” However, these words are hollow, because “gender” for the BJP is limited only to heterosexual women. So even if a UCC proposal were to be put forth, it would automatically exclude queer couples from its ambit. So how can the BJP then say that their version of the UCC aligns with modern times? It is in this regard that the return of coalition politics and a diminished BJP is a very welcome outcome for LGBTQ+ rights. But beyond marriage rights, another issue of importance to the transgender community is the implementation of horizontal reservations. The recent Madras High Court judgement in the Rakshika Raj vs State of Tamil Nadu case addressed this very concern. In it, the High Court quashed a 2015 Tamil Nadu government order that classified transgender individuals under the Most Backward Class (MBC) category for vertical reservations. The High Court held that this order was unconstitutional because it incorrectly treated the transgender identity as an aspect of caste instead of gender identity. Consequently, the court directed the current Tamil Nadu government, led by Chief Minister M K Stalin (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam or the DMK), to implement horizontal reservations for transgender people along the intersectional lines of gender identity and caste. Notably, the Dravidian Manifesto, released by the DMK in 2019, advocated for the inclusion of “homosexual persons and trans women” into society and pledged to secure their civil rights. Therefore, implementing the High Court’s order not only aligns with the DMK’s progressive social justice vision but would also signify an important step towards achieving equality for transgender individuals in Tamil Nadu. Setting the stage However, this discourse around advancing LGBTQ+ rights must extend beyond Tamil Nadu and should include causes beyond marriage equality. The inclusion of some of these issues in the 2024 manifestos of major opposition parties — the Indian National Congress (INC) and the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) — reflects a broader national shift towards equality. Additionally, their impressive electoral gains in this election cycle demonstrate that social justice issues, including those related to free speech, rights of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes, women’s reservations, and farmers’ rights, are gaining more traction with the electorate. However, the level of support for each cause varies. For example, the 2020 farmers’ protests against the BJP-NDA government’s three farm laws were powerful enough to force a repeal in 2021 due to sustained public pressure. While the LGBTQ+ community’s demands for marriage equality and horizontal reservations haven’t garnered the same level of public support yet, time may change that. Therefore, it’s more critical than ever for the LGBTQ+ community to ensure their concerns are heard by their elected representatives and brought before Parliament whenever necessary. This is especially true for legislation that directly or indirectly affects their lives. A prime example occurred in 2018 when the Lok Sabha passed the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill of 2016. Despite protests from Opposition leaders like Supriya Sule (Nationalist Congress Party — Sharadchandra Pawar or the NCP-SP) and Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar (AITC), who advocated for a more inclusive law for the LGBTQ+ community, their efforts were not reflected in the final legislation. This situation arose because the BJP’s overwhelming majority at the time allowed them to pass bills with limited need for consultation. Moving forward, such occurrences must be prevented. A sliver of hope But now there are reasons for renewed optimism. Over the years, courts have expanded the scope of LGBTQ+ rights and clarified that discrimination based solely on sexual orientation or gender identity is unconstitutional. Additionally, since decriminalisation in 2018, there has been a greater appetite for public discussion of these issues, with the marriage equality hearings forcing political leaders from major parties to take a public stance, thereby educating voters (including LGBTQ+ voters) on their positions. The current Lok Sabha composition also offers new opportunities. The BJP undoubtedly retains power but lacks the overwhelming majority it previously held. Opposition parties will now play a more prominent role in discussing and debating bills, and NDA allies like the Janata Dal (United) and Telugu Desam Party, with 12 and 16 seats respectively, will hold the potential to make or break votes on key issues. Therefore, LGBTQ+ activists must strategically engage not only with the opposition but also with NDA allies to secure their support. Finally, the re-election of notable LGBTQ+ allies to Parliament, such as Dr Shashi Tharoor (INC), Supriya Sule (NCP-SP), and Abhishek Banerjee (AITC), offers even more hope that LGBTQ+ issues will be taken up with greater seriousness and vigour. Perhaps it is kismet that June is celebrated as Pride Month indeed!

    "article_content": "Follow Us : “Who wants to go into the mine,” asks the guide, and I promptly raise my hand. I don a protective cloak and hard hat and step into the elevator clutching a miner’s lamp. It’s a tight squeeze with five of us in the tiny (faintly rattling) elevator. But it’s a short ride and soon we are 100 metres under the surface of the earth. Tunnels snake off in different directions, mining equipment stands at the ready, and a mine train awaits on its tracks. I’m at Zinngrube Ehrenfriedersdorf, a defunct tin mine turned experiential museum 25 km (40 min) south of Chemnitz in Central Saxony, Germany. On a guided tour, you can learn how tin and silver were mined in the often difficult working conditions; the highlight is, of course, a chance to ride the mine train! Aboveground, behind the mine museum, stand “The Wild Boars”, an installation by German sculptor and installation artist Carl Emanuel Wolff. The open-air bronze sculpture features three life-size wild boars standing, sitting, or lying amidst the rocks. Wolff carved them out of the damp model material with his bare hands and simple tools, with traces of his work clearly visible. The patinated gunmetal bronze contains tin as well as iron, the ore for which was mined in Ehrenfriedersdorf until 1990. The sculpture references the local legend that wild boars helped discover the mineral in the region around 800 years ago. After a mud bath, tinstone shimmered in their fur, which encouraged locals to search for the ore! This is just one of the many installations on a unique art and sculpture trail that’s being created in the region. Chemnitz will be the “European Capital of Culture” in 2025 together with 38 nearby municipalities, including Zwickau and the Ore Mountains. The title is awarded to emphasise the cultural wealth of the region and Chemnitz has chosen to pay tribute to its mining legacy with the so-called Purple Path. This art and sculpture trail features works by more than 70 international and Saxon artists and connects the city of Chemnitz with the other municipalities. The artworks are placed in socially and symbolically significant locations. About 30 km (40 min) from the mine, in the Kurpark (spa garden) of Bad Schelma, I stand gaping at ‘Stack’, a tall abstract sculpture by noted Anglo-German sculptor Tony Cragg. Liverpool-born Cragg has been residing in Wuppertal (near Düsseldorf) since 1977. He is known for his iconic stacks inspired by the geometrically stacked legacies of the industrial age, which are “keys to a past time that is our present” according to him. His sculpture in Bad Schelma was created in 2019, a stunning patinated bronze structure that brings to mind natural phenomena — weathered rock, perhaps or swirling plumes of smoke. Its location is also not an accident and is meant to reflect the history of the region. It stands right next to what was a uranium ore mining shaft from which the Soviet-German company Wismut AG extracted the uranium required for its bomb production and nuclear power plants (including Chernobyl). In the process, it destroyed the villages and natural environment in Bad Schlema. Other notable sculptures on the Purple Path include the “Petrified Wood Circle” by Turner Prize winner and pioneer of British Land Art, Richard Long. As the name suggests, it’s a circle of petrified, densely packed pieces of wood — half cedar and half American redwood — lying directly on the ground. Per Long, it’s meant to visualise the layer “that lies on top of thousands of other layers of human and geographical history on the surface of the land.” This is a travelling exhibit, which is currently to be found in the Church of St James in Chemnitz. It will later move to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of St Mary in Zwickau. Both cities lie on the Saxon Way of St James which leads to the Spanish city of Santiago de Compostela, which was the European Capital of Culture in 2000. Apart from its mining history, Chemnitz was once Germany’s leading industrial city, known for manufacturing everything from locomotives to textiles. In a sprawling red-bricked building with distinctive arches stands the Chemnitz Industrial Museum. Built in 1907, this was once a locomotive factory and foundry that was functional until 1981. Today, the museum showcases over 200 years of Saxon industrial history. It is a treat for children and adults alike, featuring everything from vintage cars and historical textile machines to modern industrial robots. However, I am most enamoured by the museum’s centrepiece — a still functioning single-cylinder counterpressure steam engine from 1896. It stands in its very own engine house, which is richly decorated with tiles and paintings, all dating to 1911. The well-maintained engine not only looks spectacular but you can also see it in action on the last Sunday of every month. Much like the sculptures along the Purple Path, it is a work of art in itself. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : In sustainability food talk, we often hear the terms “locally sourced,” “small batches,” “handmade,” and “chemical free,” and scramble to pick products from brands that offer a long line-up of options under these labels. What we forget to acknowledge is that ancient wisdom too is a sustainability yardstick in food-related matters. Knowledge sharing, functional documentation and persistent adoption of hyperlocal agro and culinary practices are extremely significant milestones in our eco-centric journeys. There’s a growing body of scientific evidence favouring the significance of culinary traditions as tools to help improve food security, nutritional equity, and overall health and environmental benefits. These could work as powerful starting points for the transformation of entire food systems. Right from harvesting, preserving, preparing and consuming local foods, our farmers and ancestors have been the keepers of knowledge for much of our food biodiversity. How we take this forward is crucial, because it could be a potentially secure anchor and cultural goalpost for youngsters stuck in a world where freezer — and not farm-to-table — is the norm. When you think about it, convenience is the watchword in a majority of urban kitchens as masalas in dry and paste form, ready to pour from sealed glitzy packets can be bought with a single click from convenience stores. The way I remember it, masalas were always made in a designated corner of my mother’s kitchen that disgorged heat fumes like fluffy clouds. There was a stoic power about the masala maker during the whole process, akin to that of the women in the movie Mirch Masala, drying and grinding the red chillies, their collective rage and spunk reflected in the redness of the chillies they dealt with. I reflect on my childhood memories of partaking in the ceremonial, bi-annual masala-making project, which pressed into service the collective energy of the entire family. There was a wide range of everyday masalas we’d churn out: rasam powder, sambar powder, vangi bhath powder, chutney pudi, menthyada hittu, to name a few. These would be stored in stainless steel canisters or washed and dried glass jam bottles and refilled at regular intervals. Today, I find myself following in my mother’s footsteps, grinding my own masalas and storing them in re-purposed bottles, sticking a twig of neem in them to keep pests at bay. As I cook with them, infusing fresh aromas into a repertoire of inherited recipes, I anticipate that they’d sprout into full-mouthed conversations at the table — even years hence, as the next generation takes over, ascribing their own meanings to the ritual. Here are some everyday staple masalas you can make and find multiple uses for, while honouring time-tested traditions and sustainability practices, by lowering energy consumption, for instance, due in most part to the supply chain logistics of packaged foods, and consequently, ecological footprint. Menthyada Hittu (Makes about 200 grams) Ingredients • 1⁄2 cup chana dal • 1⁄2 cup urad dal • 1⁄4 cup moong dal • 1⁄4 cup toor dal • 1 teaspoon jeera • 1 1⁄2 teaspoons methi • 1 1⁄2 teaspoons coriander seeds • 1 1⁄2 teaspoons whole wheat • 1 teaspoon whole black pepper • 2 sprigs curry leaves • 1⁄4 teaspoon turmeric • 1⁄2 teaspoon dry ginger powder • 4–6 dry red chillies • A pinch of asafoetida Method • Roast the dals in a pan on low heat, until they turn light brown. Empty them into a big steel plate or bowl, and set aside. • Add the jeera, methi, coriander, whole wheat to the same pan, roast on low heat until they turn light brown, empty them into the bowl/plate with the dals, and set aside. • Add the remaining ingredients to the same pan, roast under low heat for a few minutes, until the raw smell goes away, and turn off the heat. • Once all the roasted ingredients are cooled, grind them to a smooth finish in the mixie, and let cool before storing in an airtight container. It will stay for up to four weeks. • Serve this with hot rice, salt and ghee at the beginning of a meal, for better digestion and as a remedial order for acidity. Note: Make a slightly thick paste with 2-3 tablespoons of this powder and water, add a splash of tamarind juice/ extract, salt, jaggery, bring it to a gentle simmer for about 3-4 minutes, remove from heat. Add chopped cold cucumber to it and enjoy it with rice or rotis! Rasam powder (Makes about 400 grams) Ingredients • 1 teaspoon groundnut oil • 1⁄4 kg coriander seeds • 1⁄4 kg dry red chillies (Byadagi) • 50 gms cumin seeds • 50 gms fenugreek seeds • 25 gms mustard seeds • 25 gms black pepper • 2 sprigs curry leaves • 1 teaspoon turmeric • 1⁄2 teaspoon asafoetida powder Method • Heat the oil in a pan, and add the coriander seeds and red chillies, fry on low heat until they’re done. Empty both into a large steel bowl/plate, set aside. • In the same pan, fry the remaining ingredients on a low flame until done, and turn off the heat. • Once all the ingredients are cooled, grind to a fine powder in the mixie. Let it cool completely before storing in an airtight container. • Stays for upto 4 weeks outside, or 2 months in the freezer. Use in rasam according to spice preference (typically 2 teaspoons for 2 cups of rasam) Note: Use this powder for various other preparations, like Gojju, or make this quick chutney as a side dish with idli/ dosa by mixing ½ teaspoon of the masala powder with 3-4 tablespoons of thick curd, add a dash of salt and sugar, stir well.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Stage 1 hypertension, often termed prehypertension, indicates systolic (top number) readings between 120 mmHg and 139 mmHg, or diastolic (bottom number) readings between 80 mmHg and 89 mmHg. Prehypertension serves as an important warning sign, signalling the likelihood of developing high blood pressure in the future. Elevated blood pressure significantly amplifies the risk of severe health complications, including heart attack, stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and kidney failure. While there is no outright cure for high blood pressure, proactive measures can effectively manage and mitigate its progression. Naturopathy and yoga offer a holistic approach to address prehypertension. Identifying underlying causes: Naturopathic doctors conduct thorough assessments to identify the underlying factors contributing to prehypertension. This may include examining lifestyle habits, dietary patterns, stress levels, hormonal imbalances, and genetic predispositions. By understanding the unique factors influencing an individual’s blood pressure, naturopathic practitioners can tailor treatment plans accordingly. Dietary modifications: Nutrition plays a crucial role in managing prehypertension. Naturopathic doctors often recommend dietary modifications that prioritise whole foods rich in nutrients and antioxidants while minimising processed foods, sodium and added sugars. Emphasising a plant-based diet, high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, can help lower blood pressure and improve overall cardiovascular health. Lifestyle changes: Lifestyle factors such as physical activity, sleep quality, and stress management significantly impact blood pressure levels. Naturopathic practitioners emphasise the importance of regular exercise, adequate sleep, and stress-reduction techniques such as meditation, and deep breathing exercises. These lifestyle changes not only help lower blood pressure but also contribute to overall well-being. Herbal supplements: Herbal medicine has long been used in naturopathic practice to support cardiovascular health and manage hypertension. Certain herbs, such as hawthorn, garlic, hibiscus, and olive leaf extract, have demonstrated potential in lowering blood pressure and improving vascular function. Naturopathic doctors may prescribe individualised herbal formulations based on a patient’s specific needs and health history. Other therapies: In addition to dietary and lifestyle interventions, naturopathic treatment for prehypertension may incorporate other therapeutic modalities such as acupuncture, mud therapy, and hydrotherapy. These complementary therapies can help optimise blood circulation, reduce stress, and promote relaxation, improving blood pressure control. Can yoga help in managing prehypertension? Yoga, an ancient practice revered for its holistic approach to health, holds promise in aiding the management of prehypertension. Through a combination of mindful movements, controlled breathing, and relaxation techniques, yoga offers a multifaceted approach to promoting cardiovascular wellness. Here are some yoga poses and pranayama that can be incorporated into your routine to help manage prehypertension effectively. Tadasana (mountain pose) • Stand erect with feet joined together and look in front at a point. • Interlock the fingers. While inhaling, raise your hands and heels and turn your palms to face upwards. • Maintain the position with normal breath for 20 seconds. • While exhaling, bring the heels down. Benefits: Improves balance, strengthens leg muscles, and fosters mental focus, while aiding in stress reduction and blood pressure regulation. Setubandhasana (bridge pose) • Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. • Press your feet into the floor as you lift your hips towards the ceiling, engaging your glutes and thighs. • Place the palms on the waist and support the back. • Maintain the position with normal breath. • To release the pose, bring the palms down and while exhaling, bring down the spine on the floor. Benefits: Opens the chest, stretches the spine, promotes deep breathing, improves respiratory function and aids in blood pressure management. Bhujangasana (cobra pose) • Lie on your stomach, keep the legs together and place the palms beside the chest. • While inhaling, engage the back muscles to lift your head, and upper torso and look up. • Align elbows under shoulders for support. • Maintain the position for some time with normal breathing. • While exhaling, bring the chin down and relax. Benefits: Gently stretches the spine, opens up the chest, improves breathing and promotes relaxation which helps control the blood pressure. Sukhasana (the comfortable pose) • Sit with your legs stretched out and your back erect. • Place palms on the floor behind your hips, fingers pointing backwards. • Cross your legs, right foot under the left thigh and left foot under the right thigh. • Keep the spine straight, hands on knees, eyes closed and body relaxed. • Breathe slowly and evenly, maintaining the pose. Benefits: Promotes relaxation, reduces stress, and calms the mind, thereby helping to lower blood pressure. Nadi Shodhanan Pranayama (alternate nostril breathing) • Sit comfortably with your spine straight. • Adopt nasika mudra with the right hand and place the left hand on the left knee. • Close the right nostril with your right thumb, inhale gently through the left nostril and hold your breath for some time. • Close the left nostril with the ring finger, and exhale through the right nostril. • Now, inhale through the right nostril and hold the breath for some time, close the right nostril with the thumb and exhale through the left nostril. The exhalation must be longer than the inhalation. • Repeat the practice for ten rounds. Benefits: Balances nervous system, reduces stress, improves respiratory function, enhances mental clarity, and supports cardiovascular health. Prehypertension, a significant lifestyle ailment, poses serious health risks and can even be fatal in some cases. The most effective approach to prevention involves reassessing dietary habits, embracing physical activity, and implementing stress-reduction techniques.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Many Buddhist sculptures and reliefs with features borrowed from Greek and Iranian mythological figures have been found in the ancient Gandhara region, in present-day Pakistan. Although South Asian in their subject matter and content, the figures are rendered in a naturalistic style distinctly Greco-Roman, seen in their subtly toned physiques and the folds of their heavy robes, typical moustaches and hairstyles. The Bodhisattva Maitreya, for example, is distinguished by his looped knot and the water flask in his left hand; and he dons the traditional garb of an Indian prince. But the meticulously draped folds of his dhoti and his muscular torso betray the influence of Greco-Roman sculptural traditions. Situated at a geographical crossroads between the Mediterranean world and South and Central Asia, the multicultural diversity of Gandhara resulted in an artistic style known for its unique syncretic character, which combines stylistic and iconographic influences from all these regions. At Gandhara, the winged figure of Atlas, who held up the world on his shoulders in Greek mythology, was often positioned at the base of architectural structures such as Buddhist stupas, symbolically holding it up. Greco-Roman sculptural prototypes depicting wrestling figures were also adapted to illustrate scenes from the Buddha’s life. Panels depicting inebriated figures holding wine cups, drinking, dancing and making music were carved on the lower portions of public monuments. Since these were scenes of merriment, accompanying the consumption of alcohol, the images have been referred to as ‘Bacchanalian’ or ‘Dionysian’, after the Roman and Greek gods of wine and ecstasy, Bacchus and Dionysus, respectively. As with most Gandharan art, there is some ambiguity around the influences for the drinking scenes, which seem to simultaneously draw on Hellenistic, Roman, Egyptian or Ptolemaic, Hindu, Buddhist and Zoroastrian cultures in both style and subject matter. While some scholars consider the scenes to be an aspect of the cult of Dionysus, and therefore, a product of Hellenistic influence on Gandharan art — others highlight a more indigenous source for the images in the ancient cults of yakshas and yakshis, who were ritually offered meat and alcohol and were custodians of amrita, or the elixir of eternal life. Scholars speculate that Dionysus was conflated with Indra, the Hindu king of heaven, in the Gandharan context. Other objects that combined the attributes of Greco-Roman deities with local traditions include a gold coin depicting a goddess holding a cornucopia like the Greco-Roman goddess, Tyche, while also clasping a lotus flower associated with the Indian goddess of good fortune, Shri or Lakshmi. These objects underscore how Greco-Roman symbols, mythological figures and themes were appropriated and given new meanings in the Gandharan context — which defy the binaries of Hellenism and Buddhism as well as of indigenous and foreign influences — chronicling a lively exchange that disrupts our neat notions of modern geographical borders.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : A knife, one of the oldest tools invented by humans, is as much a vital implement that no kitchen can function without as it is a feared weapon in the hands of a criminal. In an ironic twist, it has now appeared as a symbol of human resilience, a courageous rebuttal to attempts at smothering free speech. An empty sheet of paper slashed by a knife is the powerful cover of Salman Rushdie's memoir titled Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder. As is well-known by now, it is the author’s account of the knife attack, an attempt to murder that he survived while on stage to deliver a lecture on the importance of keeping writers safe, at the Chautauqua Institution in New York State, on August 12, 2022. The first look of the cover evoked in my mind the famous slash paintings of the Argentine-Italian artist Lucio Fontana (1899-1968), who gave a new vocabulary to global modern art by puncturing and slashing the canvas; art which now sells for millions of dollars at auctions. Fontana is not much known in India, but his art gained widespread currency with two major retrospectives: In 2014 at the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, and in 2019, at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, with an exhibition titled ‘Lucio Fontana: On the Threshold’. However, unlike the Rushdie story, Fontana’s journey to create this language of art had nothing to do with violence. It was rather an exploration of space through holes (buchi) and cuts (tagli) in the canvas or other medium, which came to be known as the Spatialist movement in modern art, or Spazialismo in Italian. Fontana was born to Italian parents in Argentina and throughout his life, lived intermittently between the two countries. In 1946, he co-founded the experimental Altamira School of Arts in Buenos Aires, and in the same year published Manifesto Blanco (The White Manifesto), which set out goals for the creation of ‘spatialist’ art. He called upon his students to engage with new technology—including the use of light—to relook at the arts. Around the same time, the first images of the Earth from space became widely available, which added to his latent interest in the concept of space and space travel. He began by puncturing holes in his sculptures and canvas, and soon slashes followed. Fontana is known to have said, “It is not true that I made holes in the canvas to destroy it, no, I made holes to discover, to find the cosmos of an unknown dimension.” Most of these canvases are monochromatic, their surfaces lacerated with holes and cuts, with specialists likening the former to the lunar surface, rugged, serene, and inexplicably enchanting. Gradually, the artist added similar works in wood, metal and other media. Another striking series is his La Fine di Dio, 1963-64, which comprised paintings exhaustively punctured with holes of different sizes. It is widely believed to be inspired by the first human journey into outer space, completed by Yuri Gagarin in April 1961. Spatialism, as pioneered by Fontana, pushed the envelope for modern abstract art where the medium itself became an artwork as opposed to remaining a mere crutch to showcase an idea. As explorations of a pioneering concept, Fontana’s Spatialist works remain a favourite with collectors, attested to by prices achieved at auctions. His two most expensive works sold at auctions are yellow, egg-shaped oils on canvas, both titled Concetto Spaziale, and La Fine di Dio (1964), which respectively fetched $29.17 million (approx. Rs 243 crore at current exchange rates) at a Christie’s auction in November 2015, and $22.96 million (approx. Rs 191 crore) at a Sotheby’s auction on May 13, 2024. Among his slash paintings, one of the most expensive works is the Concetto Spaziale, Attese (1965), featuring a single slash on a bright red background, which sold for £6.7 million (approx. Rs 71.3 crore at current exchange rates) at a Christie’s auction in February 2008. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Whenever I go to a nursery, I’m charmed by the beautiful and vibrant orchid. It is an exquisite flower, both a gardener’s pride and challenge. Recently, I had the opportunity to meet Dr Madhusudan, the technical manager at the Orchid and Succulents division of a nursery. He willingly shared his knowledge on how to cultivate these plants properly. I’ve summarised the key insights from our conversation so that we can all grow orchids more confidently. Orchids have unique environmental requirements that differ from many other plants. According to Dr Madhusudan, the key to successfully growing orchids is understanding their natural habitat. Orchids are native to the tropics and subtropics, where they flourish in humid environments. Cool-growing orchid species, such as Miltoniopsis, originate from high-altitude, cloud-covered forest environments. In contrast, orchids like Cattleya, are found naturally in subtropical climates and are adapted to warmer but not overly hot temperatures. Vanda comes from the steamy, moisture-rich rainforests at or near sea level. The common factor for all orchids is the necessity of high humidity, without which they cannot survive. If you wish to grow an orchid garden, dedicate a space for them. Here are the things that you need to do: cover the space with a green net to trap sunlight, add misty water sprayers, and provide good air circulation to pump up the humidity. You can also use pebble trays or place the plants near a small water feature like a fountain. A relatively stable temperature range is essential for orchids to develop well, whether they’re cultivated indoors or in a greenhouse setting. Once you have the setup ready, select the right plant. Here are some things to look out for while buying orchids: Make it a point to buy from authentic sellers. Check the tag or label for the orchid’s species name, native habitat, and optimal growing conditions as this knowledge will guide your care strategy. If you are a beginner, Dr Madhusudan recommends growing simple ones like Phalaenopsis or Dendrobium because they adapt quickly to subtle changes. Look for orchids with bright, non-drooping leaves and healthy roots free of rot. It should be in an active growth phase with fresh leaves. If buying a blooming plant, choose one with a few unopened flower buds. Avoid plants showing signs of disease like spots or sogginess. Many orchids find a home when mounted on wooden planks or tree bark, which provides ideal aeration and drainage for their roots. When potting, use a well-draining medium like the one formulated specifically for epiphytic orchids. Orchid placement is also crucial—orient them towards the east or north to provide appropriate light. When you bring a new orchid home, it’s best to keep it isolated for a few days before introducing it to your existing collection. This quarantine period can prevent the spread of any diseases or pests. Orchids require regular fertilisation with both macro and micronutrients to stay healthy. A well-scheduled feeding regimen is essential. Additionally, preventative treatment with pesticides and fungicides can ward off common issues. Orchids prefer a fine mist of water. It is best to use distilled or rainwater, as tap water may contain harmful salts. For orchids growing on barks and wooden planks, throw a mug of water aimed at the roots. Orchid blooms stay for nearly two to four months in a year. When the flowers are nearing the end of their blooming phase, cut the spent blooms to redirect the plant’s energy into producing new leaves rather than maintaining the old flowers. This helps delay leaf yellowing and drying. Orchids are perennial plants. As they mature, they develop more branches and flower spikes. I picked up a Phalaenopsis after the interview and it is now growing along with other moth orchids on the bark of my Patens tree. Hope yours does too!

Lionel Scaloni's side made the breakthrough four minutes after the restart as Lionel Messi played a sublime pass to Alexis Mac Allister, who poked it away from advancing Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau and into the path of Alvarez for a simple finish.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Stuttgart: International rivalries have been put to one side in a campsite in Stuttgart as fans from various nations live in motorhomes next to one another and share the common joy of following their team at Euro 2024. While the action intensifies on the pitch, the fans are making new friends, sharing drinks and creating a festival atmosphere in a unique holiday that could end next week or next month. \"In 1990 I was with some friends in Italy at the World Cup there and it was so funny and I said at that time, okay, I will do it again,\" Harald Goerz, a Germany fan from Aachen told Reuters outside his rented motor home. \"In that time I met my wife, we have been married for 32 years. And last year we had the idea to start this travelling with the German team around Germany to all their games. \"That was ever my dream, I said to her if any time a new European Championship or World Cup is in Germany, then we will do that.\" Harald's wife Martina, sitting beside him in her Germany jersey, said they would make a photo album of their journey across the country that has taken in Munich and Stuttgart so far and then on to Frankfurt next to show their family. \"We want to have a photo album... for our grandchildren to show them: Look. When I tell our daughter about it, she watches it herself, she lives in Cologne, and she will say: 'That's amazing, it's a shame I couldn't come with you'. She is crazy about football too.\" Germany have two wins from their opening two matches, the second a 2-0 victory over Hungary at the Stuttgart Arena, which is a five minute walk from the campsite. However, there was no animosity from Hungarian fans also were camping out. \"It's amazing. That's the word... after the game we came here and we just sit in the 'pub' and drink with the Scottish fans and they are the best,\" Hungary fan Tamas Szucs said, camping with his friend Zsolt Kiraly who he met five years ago and now travels with for international matches. \"We had some German fans here, we said to them well done, good job. \"Everyone is friendly,\" he added. The Scottish fans are proving to be popular at this tournament with thousands having made the journey. At the Stuttgart campsite, groups made their way separately on the long journey from Scotland but are already one big family. \"We left Glasgow 10 days ago and drove 24 hours solid to get here. And the three guys here, they fell right out the bus. They didn't stop drinking for 24 hours. 80 cans of beer in 24 hours,\" Scotland fan John Gilmour said as his fellow fans cheered and raised fresh bottles of beer. Scotland were part of the last Euros but that one had COVID restrictions, so for some fans it has been their first real chance to see their team at a European Championship since 1996. \"This was my dream,\" said Tony, a Scotland fan who lives in Blackpool, England. \"When I was younger I can remember the football but I was too busy with children. So this time was my dream. I wasn't missing it. And I brought my son. He was born during Euro 96, so I managed to get him here as well.\" There will be more Scottish arrivals in Stuttgart ahead of their crucial Group A match against Hungary on Sunday, with both teams needing a win to be in with a shout of reaching the next stage. The chant of \"No Scotland, no party\" will be heard right across the campsite and the city this weekend. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Berlin: Germany are enjoying their best start to a tournament in more than a decade but the Euro 2024 hosts want to make it three wins from three when they face Switzerland on Sunday to seal top spot in Group A and get a potentially easier opponent in the last 16. Their two opening victories mark an even better start than they had at the 2014 World Cup when they last won a major international title. Germany require at least a draw against the Swiss, who have yet to book their spot in the next round, in order to avoid finishing second in the group and having to play the second-placed team from Group B. That could lead to a tricky round of 16 match against a team from a group featuring Italy, Spain, Croatia and Albania. Topping the group would give Julian Nagelsmann's side a seemingly easier path against the second team in Group C. England top that group on four points, with Denmark and Slovenia both on two and Serbia on one point. \"Top spot is important. We want to win all our matches,\" Nagelsmann said following Germany's 2-0 victory over Hungary in their second group game. The coach, who took over in September last year, has led a revival of the three-time European champions' title hopes, and after sticking with the same lineup in his first two matches he is unlikely to make major changes. \"I do think it is important to have as many players from the starting 11 on the pitch so that we stay in the rhythm,\" he said. \"Do not expect to have seven changes to the team. I can rule that out now.\" His players have delivered convincing performances in their 5-1 demolition of Scotland and their win over Hungary, their first in a competitive match against them in 70 years. Nagelsmann is likely to retain his attacking midfield trio of captain Ilkay Gundogan flanked by Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz that has been key to their winning start. There could be changes further back with Pascal Gross possibly slipping in for Robert Andrich in front of the defence. But Nagelsmann is in no mood to underestimate the Swiss, who drew 1-1 against the Scots earlier in the week following their opening win over Hungary. Switzerland will top the group with a win but will also advance with a draw if Scotland fail to beat Hungary in the other group match. Defeat could potentially see them exit the tournament. \"We know we are now up against a team that is of a different calibre with their super attack and the euphoria (as hosts),\" said Switzerland forward Xherdan Shaqiri. \"But we are going into the game with confidence and look forward to it. Obviously we want to bother the Germans. That's clear.\" #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: Ousted India football coach Igor Stimac on Friday said that he was given a final warning before the AFC Asian Cup merely for trying to convince the AIFF about the importance of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers, prompting him to go to the hospital for a heart condition treatment. \"After I told them that the World Cup Qualifiers were more important than Asian Cup, I received a final warning from AIFF. When I received the final warning on December 2, no one knows this, I finished in the hospital.\" Stimac also launched a stinging attack on AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey, saying the sooner he leaves the post, the better it would be for the future of football in the country where the globally-loved sport is not growing at all. Speaking on his health, Stimac said, \"I was disturbed with everything going on; stressed from the obvious problems. I had an immediate surgery on my heart. I wasn't ready to speak to anyone or find excuses. Stimac was on Monday sacked as head coach following the team's failure to reach the third round of the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers. A day later, the Croat threatened to file a lawsuit against the All India Football Federation (AIFF) in the FIFA Tribunal if his outstanding dues were not cleared in 10 days. During a lengthy online press conference on Friday, Stimac said Indian football is \"imprisoned\" and blamed Chaubey for most of the problems besetting the game. He also said that he was \"fed up of the lies and unfulfilled promises\" during his tenure. \"The sooner Kalyan Chaubey leaves AIFF, the better it is for Indian football,\" Stimac said. \"Football is the most popular sport in the world, but India is the only place where football is not growing,\" he added. Stimac was appointed as the head coach following the departure of his predecessor Stephen Constantine in March 2019. A few days after India suffered a defeat against Qatar in the final second round match of World Cup Qualifiers earlier this month, the AIFF sacked Stimac. The outspoken coach also took aim at AIFF Technical Committee head and India great I M Vijayan, saying he is not fit for the job. \"I M Vijayan was a fantastic player but he is not the person to head the national federation's technical committee,\" he said. Stimac, who was part of Croatia team that won the bronze medal at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, said he has been sacked as a coach for the first time in his career. \"In my career, I've not been sacked till now, this was the first time. And it was wrongly so - in my reply to AIFF I've done the same. \"It was impossible for me to continue without enough support, I was fed up of the lies, the unfulfilled promises and being surrounded by people who are only thinking about their own interests,\" Stimac said from Croatia. \"I was ready to put myself on the line to prepare my team for the Asian Cup to give the best shot,\" Stimac said. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Stuttgart: When you lose your phone abroad you hardly expect to get it back, let alone with a smiling selfie on it from the good-natured rival supporters who handed it in to the police. But that's exactly what happened to a Scotland fan in Germany who was reunited with his lost phone and discovered a pleasant surprise in the camera roll, the latest entreaty in a blossoming love-in between the two countries. Thousands of Scottish fans have made the long journey to the Euros, in their kilts and sporrans, and have endeared themselves to their hosts with their infectious enthusiasm and 24-hour carousing. Where once German city centres would have the sound of an oom-pah band echoing through the streets, now it's the skirl of bagpipes ringing out along with deafening chants of \"No Scotland, no party\". \"Kieran left his phone in a portaloo. These Germany fans found it, took a selfie, then handed it into the police. He has his phone back. What a country,\" supporters' body the Tartan Army Group posted on X on Thursday alongside the picture of the five smiling fans. The two nations may not be famous for their bilateral relations, though there is a connection that dates all the way back to William Wallace's letters to the Hanseatic League in 1297. However, there are now calls for a new special relationship to be formed in Europe. \"And we definitely need you guys back in the EU! We'll always leave a light on for you!,\" a German poster wrote underneath the Tartan Army Group post. \"I didn't know that the Germany-Scotland-Love is what I needed. Please don‘t ever leave, Scots!,\" another wrote, adding: \"Can we build a direct tunnel? Or a gigantic bridge?\" \"There's something special between Scotland and Germany, I don't know why, or what it is, but I can feel it,\" said another post. The Scotland fans have not just been confined to cities where the team is playing, with many spread across the country simply happy to soak in the atmosphere - and indeed the beer. \"Dear Scots, these have been a wonderful couple of days with you. I could not be a happier mayor. You are always welcome to Cologne,\" Henriette Reker, mayor of Cologne, said on X. The Tartan Army descends on Stuttgart as Scotland hope to extend their stay in Germany with a win against Hungary on Sunday. No doubt they'll now have the locals cheering them on, as well. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Duesseldorf: Ukraine revived their Euro 2024 hopes as substitute Roman Yaremchuk's late goal saw them hit back after falling a goal behind to beat Slovakia 2-1 in a lively Group E clash on Friday. Trailing at halftime to an early goal scored by Ivan Schranz, Ukraine's hopes were hanging by a thread but they produced a storming comeback in front of their joyous fans. Slovakia, who shocked Belgium in their opening match, would have ensured a last-16 spot with a win but after a dream start they paid the price for sitting back. Mykola Shaparenko equalised in the 54th minute with a close-range finish before they snatched a vital win as Yaremchuk controlled a lofted pass by Shaparenko to prod past Slovakia's goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. Victory lifted Ukraine level on three points with Slovakia and Romania, who face Belgium on Saturday. Just as they did at Euro 2020, Slovakia had won their opening match in impressive fashion by stunning Belgium. Three years ago, however, they still ended up crashing out at the group stage. They began against Ukraine clearly determined to avoid a repeat and dominated the opening exchanges on a Duesseldorf pitch greased up pre-match rain. Ukraine keeper Anatoliy Trubin, one of five changes to the Ukraine team beaten 3-0 by Romania, kept his side level with saves in quick succession to keep out a Lukas Haraslin shot and Schranz's close-range effort. Slovakia were rewarded or their positive start in the 17th minute though when Haraslin's measured lobbed cross was headed in at the far post by Schranz for his second goal of the tournament, having also scored winner against Belgium. With their tournament hopes looking as gloomy as the Duesseldorf sky, Ukraine finally sprang to life. Mykhailo Mudryk blasted one shot high over the bar, had a better effort blocked by Slovakia defender Peter Pekarik before right back Oleksandr Tymchyk thumped a skidding low drive against the post with keeper Martin Dubravka beaten. Dubravka then had to be alert to beat out a free kick by Oleksandr Zinchenko, although at the other end Slovakia threatened to double their lead on the counterattack with Haraslin's shot well saved by Trubin. Ukraine began the second half on the front foot and Artem Dovbyk, top scorer in La Liga last season, was just unable to direct a Mudryk cross at goal. Kicking towards their yellow and blue-clad fans, Ukraine's mounting pressure paid off a minute later when an unmarked Shaparenko was picked out by Zinchenko's silky pass and he calmly sent a left-footed shot into the corner. Slovakia looked content to hang on for a point but were fortunate when Mudryk struck the post with a shot from an acute angle with 15 minutes left. Ukraine then dug deep and Yaremchuk was picked out by the excellent Shaparenko to send the war-torn nation into their final group game full of hope. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Berlin: A superb second-half performance by Austria kick-started their hopes of making the Euro 2024 knockout stage with a 3-1 win over Poland on Friday, with Gernot Trauner, Christian Baumgartner and Marko Arnautovic all getting on the scoresheet. The Austrians, who lost to France in their opener, survived a spirited first-half comeback in which Poland equalised and came close to taking the lead before the wheels came off in the second half as they slumped to a second loss in the tournament. Undeterred by news that record scorer Robert Lewandowski was still not fit to start, Polish fans lit a handful of flares as they belted out the national anthem, with a cloud of smoke wafting towards the goal Austria defended in the first half. That was about as close as the Poles got in the opening exchanges, with Austria dominating possession through repeated attacks up the left flank and going ahead in the ninth minute. Philipp Mwene's long throws were a threat from the start and Austria's goal came when one of them was headed back into his path, allowing the left back to cross for Trauner to score with a bullet header into the top corner after nine minutes. However, Poland levelled on the half-hour mark as Austria failed to clear a corner satisfactorily and when Trauner blocked a shot from Jan Bednarek, the ball fell kindly for Krsysztof Piatek to control and then steer into the net. Austria goalkeeper Patrick Pentz had to pull off a superb one-handed save in first-half stoppage time and when Lewandowski finally entered the fray on the hour Polish hopes rose, only to be quickly dashed. Austria's second goal in the 66th was beautiful in its simplicity as they switched play from right to left before Alexander Prass picked out Baumgartner with a pinpoint pass and the midfielder's cool finish gave Wojciech Szczesny no chance. When Marcel Sabitzer then tore through the middle, Szczesny had no choice to bring him down and Marko Arnautovic drilled the resulting spot kick low to the keeper's left to make it 3-1 after 78 minutes and leave the Poles with a mountain to climb. Though they still have a chance of making it through to the knockout stage, Poland will be unable to finish in the top two should France avoid defeat by the Netherlands later on Friday. The Poles face France in their final group game on Tuesday in Dortmund when Austria taking on the Dutch in Berlin. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Leipzig, Germany: France and the Netherlands played it safe in a 0-0 draw in Group D at Euro 2024 on Friday that left them within sight of a place in the last 16 and made Poland the first team to be eliminated. With France captain Kylian Mbappe on the bench after suffering a broken nose in their opener, the game sparked into life in fits and starts, without ever threatening to turn into a classic. Netherlands' Xavi Simons had the ball in the net in the second half but the goal was disallowed because Denzel Dumfries, standing offside next to keeper Mike Maignan, was penalised with the decision eventually confirmed by VAR after a lengthy delay. The result leaves the group open, although with four points in the bag both France and the Netherlands will think they have most likely done enough to reach the last 16. France next face Poland, who have no points after losing 3-1 to Austria earlier on Friday, while the Netherlands meet the Austrians, who have three points, also on Tuesday. The saga around Mbappe's selection dominated the build-up, with his appearance at training on Thursday wearing a tricolore mask seen as a sure sign he was set for inclusion. The first half was at times frenetic, with the Dutch going close within the first minute as Jeremie Frimpong's effort was tipped around the post by Maignan before Antoine Griezmann had an early shot palmed over at the other end. France should have taken the lead minutes later when Adrien Rabiot was played through on goal but inexplicably chose to pass to Griezmann, who was so stunned by his generosity that he miscontrolled, stumbled and lost possession. With Mbappe out of the picture, Griezmann slotted into the role as France's main man, firing another chance wide and heading straight at keeper Bart Verbruggen from a Rabiot cross. By contrast, the Netherlands seemed to lack a real threat, with most of their attacks petering out with all their forwards guilty of failing to find a telling pass when the penalty area honed into view. As the second half progressed, France increased the tempo with Marcus Thuram flashing a shot wide on the hour, Aurelien Tchouameni heading over and an off-balance Griezmann again thwarted by Verbruggen from close range. The Dutch thought they had finally broken the deadlock when Simons flashed a shot into the net only for the celebrations to be halted by the linesman's flag and dashed by VAR. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Chile and Peru missed the chance to take a big step toward Copa America quarter-final qualification on Friday night, playing out a dour 0-0 draw in their Group A opener in Arlington, Texas . The teams were striving to join Argentina on three points after the defending champions' 2-0 victory over Canada, whose qualification hopes have also been boosted by the draw. The stalemate reflected Chile and Peru's struggles in the CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifying, where they have jointly managed just four goals across 12 matches. Chile's Alexis Sanchez squandered the game's best opportunity in the 16th minute. The former Inter Milan and Arsenal forward missed a golden opportunity when he received Victor Davila's low cross in the six-yard box, only to send his effort soaring over the crossbar. Chile showed more attacking flair but failed to execute the crucial final pass in a first half marred by injuries, with Peru's Luis Advincula subbed off in the 35th minute and Chilean midfielder Diego Valdes being replaced at halftime. Peru's Miguel Araujo nearly broke the deadlock in the 43rd minute, forcing Chile's goalkeeper Claudio Bravo into an acrobatic save with a well-connected header from Sergio Pena's free kick. Despite Peru's striker Gianluca Lapadula creating the most dangerous moments of the second half, he failed to seriously challenge Bravo. His most promising chance came in the 57th minute when a deflection fell to him, but his slip resulted in a weak shot easily saved by Bravo. In the 79th minute, his volley from Pena's corner forced Bravo into another save, and the keeper managed to collect the rebound just in time to prevent a second attempt. Bravo's performance in goal capped a special night for the former Barcelona and Manchester City goalkeeper, who at 41 years, 2 months and 16 days became the oldest-ever Copa America player. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Brazil 's teenage prodigy Endrick will be hoping to make his first appearance for the national team at a major tournament when his country takes on Costa Rica in their Copa America opener on Monday. The 17-year-old striker, who joined Real Madrid from Palmeiras, knows he has a long way to go to break into the Brazilian starting line-up in a squad that includes Raphinha, Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo in attack. \"Only God knows (when I will start). I am very grateful to have Abel (Ferreira) as a coach, he knew when to play me. Everything is up to God and Professor Dorival Jr. He is a spectacular coach. He is doing what is best for the Brazilian team,\" Endrick told a press conference on Friday. Endrick, who in March became the youngest player to score in an international match at Wembley when he gave Brazil a 1-0 win over England, made his mark in the other warm-up fixtures ahead of Copa America with a goal in a 3-2 victory over Mexico, having also scored against Spain. The ruthless competitor added that, despite his youth, there was no pressure on him on the pitch because of his confidence against the opponents. \"I have always been very precocious in my life and since I became a professional, I have played against opponents who have always teased me, insulted me, talked about my family, my girlfriend,\" he said. \"But I got used to it quickly because I was 16. I'm calm and I hope I can help, I think it's right, in football you have to destabilise the other player. It's been like that since I arrived, so I've adapted and I'm very confident that I can help the team.\" Brazil will also face Paraguay and Colombia in Group D. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Atlanta: Canada Soccer said they were in touch with the sport's governing bodies after one of their players received racist abuse online following their 2-0 loss to Argentina in the Copa America opener on Thursday. Canada Soccer did not reveal the player's name but centre back Moise Bombito, who is Black, received abuse online following a crunching tackle on Lionel Messi where he caught the Argentina skipper on the ankle. \"Canada Soccer is aware of and deeply disturbed by racist comments made online and directed at one of our men's national team players following tonight's match,\" it said in a statement. \"We are in communication with CONCACAF and CONMEBOL about this matter,\" it said, referring to the soccer governing bodies for the Americas. Posting on social media after the match, Bombito wrote: \"My beautiful Canada,\" adding a heart emoji. \"No room for that bs.\" CONCACAF, the governing body for football in North, Central America and the Caribbean, said they will investigate the accounts that posted the material. \"We stand with Canada Soccer in condemning the disgraceful media posts aimed at Moise Bombito. Racism has no place in our sport or in society,\" it said in a statement. CONMEBOL also issued a statement in support of the player and echoed CONCACAF's actions, stating that they will act according to the necessary parameters with those who decide to act outside the rules of coexistence. \"Our organisation works permanently in the evolution of a new culture that eradicates expressions of racism, offensive content on social networks and any kind of violence or discrimination around our football,\" it said. Earlier this week, world soccer body FIFA said its social media tools designed to protect players from online abuse would be available to all 211 member associations and their teams. Argentina's victory with goals from Julian Alvarez and Lautaro Martinez gave the defending champions three points while Canada are bottom of Group A. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Frankfurt: After a stuttering start to Euro 2024, England midfielder Declan Rice admitted the players are feeling immense pressure to bring home the nation's first major trophy in 58 years. Although Gareth Southgate's team top Group C with four points and have one foot in the knockout round ahead of Tuesday's game against Slovenia, they received scathing criticism after Thursday's 1-1 draw with Denmark. \"We are all so desperate to do the country proud,\" Rice said. \"We are all so desperate to win, to be leaders, to go out there and give people memories for lifetimes, and sometimes I maybe feel like we put too much pressure on ourselves where we could just go out there and let it just take care of ourselves.\" The Arsenal player is part of Southgate's leadership group along with captain Harry Kane, vice-captain Kyle Walker and Jude Bellingham, tasked with helping less experienced members . England have a dozen players who have never played in a major tournament and one of Southgate's concerns was how they would handle the pressure. Part of the frustration comes from the richly talented squad Southgate has, including several of the top forwards in Europe, including Bellingham, who had a remarkable season at Real Madrid and Premier League player of the year Phil Foden. \"I think there is probably more pressure now from the outside just because of the seasons some of our players have had,\" Rice said. \"If you look at the goals that our front four (Foden, Bellingham, Harry Kane and Bukayo Saka) have scored this year, it's over 100 between them. \"Of course, there is expectation because they are the best players in the world. And that goes for everyone throughout the team. There's going to be that pressure. This is England (at) a major tournament. But this is our job and this is what we have to deal with.\" Southgate's team were criticised for their lack of pressing in the Denmark game and their 1-0 win over Serbia. \"I think it's just connections all over the pitch,\" said Rice. \"You need to have your connections. We work on our pressing all the time.\" Slovenia have two points after draws against Denmark and Serbia. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Dortmund, Germany: Bernardo Silva's first goal at a major tournament, a calamitous own goal from Samet Akaydin and a Bruno Fernandes tap-in gave Portugal a comfortable 3-0 win over Turkey on Saturday to guarantee qualification for the last 16 as Group F winners. Silva gave Portugal the lead in the 21st minute, rifling home after Nuno Mendes' cross deflected kindly into his path before Akaydin failed to look and passed the ball beyond onrushing goalkeeper Altay Bayindir seven minutes later. Fernandes effectively ended the contest after 56 minutes when Cristiano Ronaldo -- who could have become the oldest goalscorer in European Championship history -- selflessly passed to his former Manchester United teammate to tap home. The victory secures Portugal's progress while Turkey must avoid defeat on Wednesday to the Czech Republic, who drew 1-1 with Georgia earlier on Saturday, to be certain of qualifying for the knockout rounds. Portugal started sharply and were unfazed by the deafening whistles from Turkey's supporters when in possession, with Ronaldo drawing an easy save from Bayindir inside two minutes. Turkey -- who had lost all three of their previous European Championship games against Portugal without scoring -- often played out from the back and the gamble almost paid off after 20 minutes, but Pepe's last-man challenge stopped Orkun Kokcu. Portugal scored shortly after through a quick break down the left, when Mendes played a dangerous ball across goal which Silva turned home for his first major tournament goal in his 15th game at either the World Cup or European Championship. A defensive mix-up doubled their lead when Bayindir wandered out of his goal to collect a misplaced pass towards Ronaldo, only to watch Akaydin's backpass roll past him in slow motion. Kerem Akturkoglu forced a great save from Diogo Costa almost immediately after, but Turkey otherwise created precious few chances. The second half started in subdued fashion before substitute Ruben Neves played a long pass over the top, which fell to Ronaldo who laid the ball on a plate for Fernandes to score. The game petered out even after Turkey boss Vincenzo Montella introduced teenage star Arda Guler but was marred by several pitch invaders in the last 20 minutes of the game, all of whom made a beeline for a selfie with Ronaldo. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Cologne, Germany:A goal by Youri Tielemans after 73 seconds and a late one for Kevin De Bruyne gave Belgium a 2-0 win over Romania in an incredible game full of chances on Saturday that set up a final round showdown with all four teams in Group E on three points. It was a Saturday night special played in an astonishing atmosphere in Cologne, with the only mystery being how there were only two goals. All outcomes are now available on the final night of matches when Belgium play Ukraine and Slovakia play Romania, when four points could be enough to top the group but could also see a team eliminated. Belgium, still somehow ranked third in the world by FIFA, were unrecognisable from the sluggish side shocked by Slovakia in their opening game, pouring forward and full of energy from the first whistle. It paid dividends immediately as Romelu Lukaku held up the ball with his back to goal before rolling it into the path of Tielemans, who drilled home a crisp, low shot. Four minutes later Romania went close with a header by Radu Dragusin that Koen Casteels saved well, but it was a brief respite as Belgium ran the first-half show. Dodi Lukebakio’s fierce shot was well saved by Florin Nita after a trademark carving run by De Bruyne, while Lukebakio and Amadou Onana both blazed over when free in front of goal. It seemed only a matter of time before they scored again, but Romania weathered the storm and, knowing how they struck so devastatingly on the counter to beat Ukraine, did not panic. Their fans certainly stayed behind them, helping create an amazing atmosphere as noise rained down from all four stands. The waves of Belgian attacks continued though, as Jeremy Doku fizzed a cross inches from Lukaku’s head, De Bruyne curled one just past a post then had another shot smothered by Nita. Lukaku thought he had got the second after an hour slotting home confidently from a De Bruyne through ball, only for VAR to rule it out for offside – five days after he had two goals chalked off against Slovakia. The incredible end-to-end action continued with Dennis Man clean through for Romania only to shoot wastefully straight at Casteels and then, incredibly, it was the Belgian keeper who set up the second goal 10 minutes from time with a Sunday league route one goal. He launched a goal kick that evaded everyone and the ever-switched on De Bruyne seized on it to tuck the ball home for what could prove a priceless goal should the calculators be needed to split the teams next week. #Elections2024"

Both of Venezuela's goals came from substitutes. Jhonder Cadiz leveled the match in the 64th minute before Eduard Bello struck in the 74th to boost Venezuela's chances of reaching the quarter-finals.

Bello sealed victory for Venezuela 10 minutes later, smashing a rebound high into the net from close range after Rondon drew a save from Ecuador keeper Alexander Dominguez with a diving header. Valencia was sent off after making contact with Jose Martinez's face. Ecuador's talisman and top international scorer initially earned a yellow for the challenge but the card was upgraded to a red after the referee was sent to the monitor by the video assistant.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Frankfurt: Striker Niclas Fuellkrug scored a stoppage time equaliser as hosts Germany rescued a point after a 1-1 draw with Switzerland on Sunday to seal top spot in Group A and maintain their momentum going into the last 16 of Euro 2024 . Swiss forward Dan Ndoye had threatened to spoil the party with a first half opener, but Germany, who had already sealed a last-16 place before kickoff, are now on a seven-game unbeaten run stretching back to November and kept plugging away until the equaliser eventually came through Fuellkrug’s powerful header. The home side had a goal disallowed and several penalty appeals rejected by Italian referee Daniele Orsato, and it looked to be a frustrating night before Fuellkrug finished one of their 18 attempts at goal in a feverish atmosphere in Frankfurt. It denied the Swiss what would have been a second win over Germany in 22 competitive matches dating back to 1959, but their passage through to the last-16 is also secure. Germany top the pool with seven points from their three games, two ahead of Switzerland, while Hungary (three points) must wait to see if they will advance as one of the best third-placed teams following a 1-0 win over eliminated Scotland (one). Kai Havertz's early header from a corner was saved by the Swiss keeper and then a shout for a penalty when he was bundled over the box was dismissed on a frustrating evening for him that may draw attention to his effectiveness in the team. Germany thought they had the lead on 17 minutes when Robert Andrich’s shot from 30-yards somehow beat Switzerland goalkeeper Yann Sommer at his near post but the latter’s blushes were spared when the goal was ruled out for a foul by Jamal Musiala. Instead it was the Swiss who scored just before the half-hour mark. Musiala was bundled off the ball in midfield and when Remo Freuler was found on the left-hand side of the box, his low cross was turned into the roof of the net by Ndoye. Ilkay Gundogan miss-hit a shot from the edge of the box when well-placed early in the second period, and Toni Kroos drilled the ball wide from distance as Germany pushed for the equaliser. They created numerous chances as they camped in the Swiss half, but after Havertz had wasted several, Fuellkrug rose highest to head in David Raum’s cross in the 92nd minute and preserve their unbeaten start to their home championship. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Stuttgart: Hungary snatched a 100th-minute winner to beat Scotland 1-0 and put themselves in contention for a last-16 spot at the European Championship while condemning the Scots to yet another failure at a major tournament. Kevin Csoboth's breakaway goal with almost the last kick of the match ensured Hungary finished third in Group A with three points while Scotland, yet to reach the knockout phase of either the Euros or World Cup, end in last place on two points. Hungary must wait to see whether they will qualify for the last 16 in one of the places reserved for the best four third-placed finishers. Their progress now rests on results from other groups going their way over the next three days. The match was a scrappy affair, with both teams struggling to exert any kind of control. Scotland did dominate possession in the opening 25 minutes but could not fashion any clear-cut chances. Indeed, they had no shots at all in the first half despite having 61 per cent of the ball. Hungary, meanwhile, grew into the game and began threatening on the break and making quick transitions, with captain Dominik Szoboszlai in particular threatening from set pieces. The midfielder's freekick to the far post in the 41st minute was met by an unmarked Willi Orban but his poor header clipped the top of the bar from close range. Che Adams had Scotland's first shot shortly after the break but he blasted it over. The game was paused for a lengthy period in the 68th minute after a horrible clash between Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn and Barnabas Varga from another Szoboszlai freekick. Varga appeared to be knocked out cold and needed urgent treatment, and Hungary players erected blankets around him as a screen while they looked in distress. The forward was carried off the field on a stretcher to applause from the crowd. He was taken to Stuttgart Hospital where Hungarian media said he was conscious and communicating with staff. Scotland had a strong appeal for a penalty dismissed in the 79th minute when substitute Stuart Armstrong ran on to the ball in the box but fell under contact from Orban. However, the referee did not consider it a foul. The game become more chaotic and both teams drove forward seeking a winner. Gunn did well to save from Szoboszlai's shot at the near post in the first minute of stoppage time, while Csoboth struck the post a minute later from the right side of the box when bearing down on goal. Scotland rushed forward and McTominay slid in at the near post to meet a low cross but the ball missed the target. It was from a Scottish corner that Hungary turned into a rapid counter-attack up the pitch and a long cutback across the box fell to Csoboth who slotted the ball in, sending Hungary fans delirious and players from their bench running over in celebration. Scotland could only look on dejected as their bid to make history ended in dramatic fashion. \"Tonight's devastating, the lads are absolutely gutted. Yeah but it's up to us to pick them up and that will happen slowly but surely,\" Scotland captain Andy Robertson said. \"But thank you to the country because we felt everyone behind us, and we knew the excitement back home -- sorry for letting you down.\" #Elections2024"

Folarin Balogun added the second shortly before half-time and while the tournament hosts pushed for more goals in the second half, they were unable to add to their tally. \"The message to the team is it's always important to win your first game,\" US coach Gregg Berhalter said. \"We talked about progressing our performance, improving our performance throughout the tournament, so I think it was a good starting point.\" The US were aggressive right from the start against Bolivia, who have just one win in their last 31 Copa America matches. A missed opportunity by Balogun in the first 20 seconds was soon forgotten when Pulisic scored a spectacular goal from the edge of the box, beating Bolivian keeper Guillermo Viscarra. It was Pulisic's 30th goal in 69 international matches. His first came against Bolivia in May 2016. The US doubled their lead in the 44th minute when Pulisic found Balogun and the striker ended his six-match goal drought in international matches with a low shot into the bottom corner. The hosts continued their onslaught with Ricardo Pepi, who came on as a substitute in the 65th minute, denied four times by Viscarra. \"We tried to recover but of course, after the goal in minute three, it all went down the hill,\" Bolivia coach Antonio Carlos Zago told reporters. \"We should have competed a bit more, but we need to be aware that we had the host team in front of us. They are a strong national team, and I am really happy with the effort made by the players.\" The US next face CONCACAF rivals Panama on Thursday in Atlanta, while Uruguay will take on Bolivia in New Jersey. #Elections2024"

Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay, who have won the Copa America a joint record 15 times, were rewarded for their blistering early pace when Araujo fired home a sublime curling effort from the edge of the area in the 16th minute. Panama grew into the match after the break and wasted several chances to get themselves back into the contest. Jose Fajardo blasted an effort wide in the 52nd minute after a defensive error by Mathias Olivera, while Jose Rodriguez tested Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet with a ferocious shot from range. Uruguay were on the ropes for much of the second half but Nunez, who had already missed a string of chances, settled their nerves in the 85th minute with a coolly-taken volley into the bottom corner after a rebound dropped kindly for him. In a frenetic spell during stoppage time, Vina rose highest to head home Uruguay's third from a set-piece before Michael Amir Murillo netted a consolation goal for Panama after cutting back onto his left foot and curling his shot past Rochet.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: The Congress' interim Delhi chief Devender Yadav on Sunday alleged that instead of finding a solution to the water shortage issue in the national capital, Water Minister Atishi and BJP MPs and leaders are \"playing politics\" over it. In a statement, Yadav said Atishi, who has accused BJP-ruled Haryana of depriving nearly 28 lakh people of Delhi by releasing 100 million gallons per day (MGD) less water, is indulging in political showmanship. The minister, who is sitting on an indefinite hunger strike to seek release of Delhi's share of water, should have taken effective steps to address the issue on a priority before staging the \"Jal Satyagrah drama\", he said. Yadav also slammed the BJP's \"gamesmanship\" over the water shortage issue and said its seven MPs from Delhi should have taken up the matter with the Haryana government as well as the Union Jal Shaki minister on the BJP-ruled state releasing less water. Instead of protesting on the streets and getting drenched by the Delhi Police's water cannons during this acute crisis, the BJP leaders should have worked to resolve the issue and save the people from agony and misery. Earlier in the day, Atishi alleged Delhi is not getting its share of water as Haryana has shut all the gates of the Hathnikund barrage and asserted she will continue her indefinite hunger strike over the issue. The closure of the gates of the barrage on the Yamuna river, she said, has led to the water shortage in the national capital. Her hunger strike seeking release of its share of water for Delhi, which is under the grip of a severe shortage amid a searing heat wave, entered its third day on Sunday. Yadav also took the Delhi government to task over the deaths of more than 200 people in the searing heat wave battering the city. It was really shocking that, according to official figures, 238 poor people have lost their lives due to the unrelenting heat wave sweeping the city but the Delhi government's health minister is issuing statements to justify his inaction, he alleged. #Elections2024"

Speaking to reporters in Gwalior , he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take an appropriate decision (regarding conducting a caste census). “The BJP had supported caste census there (in Bihar) and is not against it. The home minister (Amit Shah) also said we are not against it. A decision will be taken at an appropriate time. The Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) will decide in this regard”, Choudhary said when asked about the BJP's stand on conducting caste census. Queried on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s remarks on NEET paper 'leak' and reservations, Choudhary said Rahul didn't know what he was saying. \"Rahul's father (late prime minister) Rajiv Gandhi had opposed the implementation of the Mandal Commission. When BR Ambedkar gave reservations to Dalits and tribals in 1952, Jawaharlal Nehru opposed it\". Terming the Congress and the I.N.D.I.A. bloc as “anti-reservation\", Choudhary said (Bharatiya Jana Sangh founder) Shyama Prasad Mookerjee had supported the reservation for Dalits and tribals. \"Ex-prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani had also supported the Mandal Commission,\" he claimed. Acknowledging that poverty remains a concern though all sections of society are under the reservation system, Choudhary said PM Modi is working to find a solution. The Bihar Deputy CM said he would remove his turban in Lord Ram temple in Ayodhya on July 2. Choudhary, when in Opposition, had resolved to remove his turban only after dethroning Nitish Kumar as the chief minister. \"However, the BJP extended its support to Kumar and made him CM again. I will offer my turban to Lord Ram in support of BJP and Bihar,\" he added. #Elections2024"

Sometimes some lessons turn out to be the best learnings, and taking cue from the incident of Bengaluru residents cleaning Balagere Road, the concerned officials at BBMP have been personally instructed by me to take immediate action. The comfort and safety of our Bengaluru… pic.twitter.com/wIJomjWazl DH reported that on Sunday, residents of Balagere -- many of whom work in IT companies -- put on their work gloves to clean a part of the road between Kadubeesanahalli and Varthur, a stretch that had become a hazard for drivers and pedestrians. Their action was prompted by the BBMP giving up on the work, citing lack of funds. They were alarmed by frequent two-wheeler skids and decided to clear the layer of silt that stretched almost three kilometres on both sides of the road, nearly covering a a full lane in each direction. When the civic body gave up, residents had raised a plea on social media, taking the matter up to the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO). After the complaint, BBMP sent a mechanised sweeping machine that cleared the silt for 500 metres. When the residents publicised their symbolic protest, which also involved cleaning the road, the municipal body deployed its workers to clean the road for three days. Clement Jayakumar, a member of the Mahadevapura Task Force constituted by MLA Manjula Limbavalli, said the Balagere Road did not fall under the BBMP’s annual maintenance contract. “Even the sweeping machines are deployed only on the Outer Ring Road,” he said, urging the civic body to bring all arterial roads either under the annual maintenance contract or deploy sweeper machines. Balagere resident Swetha said the busy stretch was never cleaned in the last seven years. “About Rs 600 crore gets collected as property tax from the Mahadevapura assembly constituency, but the BBMP does not respond to our complaints, even if we beg them. Balagere Road needs a dedicated team to desilt the road on a daily basis,” she said. The BBMP did not bother to send a tractor to haul away the silt the residents had cleared so painstakingly on Sunday, she added. (With DHNS inputs) #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : London: Tennis great Roger Federer says he is enjoying dedicating his time to his family and not rushing into any big projects following his retirement nearly two years ago. Premiering a new documentary film in London on Thursday that tracks the final days of his sporting career, the 20-times Grand Slam champion said he was very happy with his life. \"I'm definitely not bored at home. Life's great. I'm trying to be the best dad I can,\" the 42-year-old Federer, who has two sets of twins with his wife Mirka, said. \"What's next? I want to actually wait and see a little bit. I don't want to have a million things to do right now. I want to be a good dad, a good husband, and be settled a little bit more and then decide, sort of the next mega project, if you like.\" \"Federer: Twelve Final Days\" captures the emotional roller-coaster of the tail end of the tennis star's career. Initially intended as a series of home videos for his personal use, it sees Federer preparing his retirement announcement and takes audiences behind the scenes of his tearful farewell in front of his fans and former rivals at the 2022 Laver Cup in London. Co-directed by Joe Sabia, known for his \"73 Questions\" celebrity interviews and Oscar-winning filmmaker Asif Kapadia, the documentary mixes candid moments, archive material and interviews with fellow tennis greats Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. The emotion of the two weeks took Sabia, who was given unprecedented access to the Swiss tennis star at his home and in the locker-room, by surprise. \"I wasn't expecting him to be so nervous. It was really nerve-wracking watching him be so nerve-wracked because I'm just kind of there observing, not saying a thing, watching as a fly on the wall,\" he said. Federer, who turns 43 in August, said he was happy to let his feelings show on screen. \"It's not like I'm crying through 1.5 hours of the film, you know? It's a tough watch, but a good one,\" he said. \"You see the struggles that we go through and also how vulnerable we are in many ways and how much the fans and the spotlight means to me,\" he said. \"It's such a beautiful moment in time that I'm really curious to find out how people will like it. We'll see.\" \"Federer: Twelve Final Days\" starts streaming on Prime Video on June 20. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Roger Federer has been retired for two years, Rafael Nadal has been making fleeting appearances in the last couple of years and Novak Djokovic remains the final vestige and a rapidly disappearing remnant of the so-called 'Big Three' which has held sway over men's tennis with an iron fist for close to two decades. This wasn't the case just six months ago. If anything, Djokovic appeared fitter, stronger, hungrier and more determined than ever before. He bookended 2023, one of the most incredible years of his career, with the US Open — his third Grand Slam of the season following his triumphs at the Australian Open and French Open. The wins in Melbourne and Paris were special for different reasons. While the Serbian reasserted his supremacy in Australia (a country that had kicked him out the previous year for not adhering to its Covid protocols) with a record-extending 10th title, he overtook his greatest rival's Slam tally of 22 with a third trophy on the unforgiving clay of Roland Garros -- Rafael Nadal's spiritual home. He almost added Wimbledon before being stopped by an inspired Carlos Alcaraz but the young Spaniard couldn't stop Djokovic from adding the US Open to increase his Slam count to 24. There was also a small matter of ending the year as the world No. 1 for a record eighth time. And, at that time, the wait for the pretenders to completely supplant the dominant trio looked excruciatingly long and hard. Six months down the line, however, the scenario couldn't have been starker. Djokovic, 37, suddenly looks vulnerable. The aura of \"invincibility\" is fading and the cloak of quiet confidence is conspicuous by its absence both in deeds and words. As of now, the former world No. 1 is recuperating from a surgery he had following his withdrawal from the French Open. He has his eyes set on the Olympics in July and will most probably miss Wimbledon. That means someone other than the \"Big Three\" would lay his hands on the grass Slam, and should that materialise, it will be the first instance in more than a decade that the All England men's trophy will bear a name other than Federer, Nadal and Djokovic twice in succession. And if Djokovic's slide continues and the US Open slips out of his grasp, all four Slams will have a champion other than the legendary three. But, irrespective of whether Djokovic retains the only Slam he holds at the moment or not, the era of the Big Three may conclusively be coming to an end if it hasn't already. It will take nothing less than a miracle for Nadal to win another Grand Slam while Djokovic isn't going to be the same force. He may still win big-ticket events here and there but could increasingly find it tough to tame an unyielding generation of players led by Alcaraz and Sinner. At 21, Alcaraz is already the youngest player to have won a Slam on all three surfaces while Sinner, a year older and the newest world No. 1, has displayed enough skills to be considered a worthy challenger to Nadal's heir apparent. All things being equal, Alcaraz and Sinner will be the prime protagonists of a new great rivalry in tennis and that augurs well for the game that was desperately looking for infusion of fresh blood after the inevitable decline of Nadal following the exit of Federer. Spare a thought, however, for the likes of Daniil Medvedev, Alexander Zverev and Stefanos Tsitsipas among others... These three and a few others arrived on the scene when the Big Three were still strong enough to keep their aspirations in check. Now that their greatest adversaries are gone or on the decline, they are facing an equally great resistance from the younger lot. Medvedev, Zverev and Tsitsipas are all on the wrong side of 20s but have just one Slam between the three of them while Alcaraz and Sinner already have four between them. You know which way the winds are blowing. Here is a trivia: Alcaraz gets a tattoo every time he wins a Grand Slam. He has won three and if he remains as prolific, his six-foot frame may not be enough to ink them all! But what we witnessed over the last two decades was celestial. Where 14 Grand Slams (by Pete Sampras) looked unachievable not too long ago, it has gone up to 24 at the moment with Djokovic still capable of adding more to the tally. If you want to settle for the next best, it's 22 (by Nadal) followed by Federer's 18. A whopping 64 Majors between just three players is astounding. When asked about matching or overtaking Nadal's record of 14 French Open titles or Djokovic's total of 24 Grand Slams, Alcaraz played down the expectations. \"Both things are out of the ordinary,\" he said. \"You have to be an alien to get it. What Rafa did with 14 is practically impossible. \"The 24 Grand Slams I hope I can but it is almost impossible. Both things are out of the ordinary... So it is unbelievable. Right now I can't think about it.\" Alcaraz, head firmly on his shoulders, may have been modest but the enormity of that achievement wouldn't have escaped him. With a game for all surfaces, unlike the Big Three whose struggles stood exposed at least on one surface each, Alcaraz has a realistic chance of raising the bar but it's a long shot. But can he -- along with Sinner and another contemporary -- perhaps a Holgar Rune or a Casper Ruud or a Hubert Hurkacz -- recreate the magic of the Big Three? That's in the realm of fantasies. But then, what we witnessed over the last two decades was nothing less than a fantasy. #Elections2024"

The 37-year-old Scot, a three-time Grand Slam champion and double Olympic gold medallist, said in February that he was unlikely to continue playing after the summer. Murray is set to compete at the Games having been named in Britain's team on Sunday and said the prospect of competing at Paris had been a real motivation for him. \"Probably if I was going to finish my career I would rather finish at Wimbledon or an Olympic Games - to me that would probably be more fitting\", Murray, who won gold at London 2012 and Rio 2016, told BBC Sport . \"I've had amazing experiences and memories from Wimbledon, but also being part of British Olympics teams. To get a chance to compete at a fifth one is a reason to stay motivated and continue playing.\" Wimbledon runs from July 1-14 at the All England Club. The Olympic tennis tournament begins on July 27 and ends on August 4 at Roland Garros. All England Lawn Tennis Club chief executive Sally Bolton revealed on Thursday that they have plans to honour Murray, if this year's tournament turns out to be a farewell to the 2013 and 2016 champion. \"I think in lots of careers, retirement is something you celebrate and people really look forward to that day – that's not something I feel. I love playing tennis\", Murray added. \"Ultimately, if physically you're not able to play to the level you want to, the results are not as you wish, those things factor into the decision\". #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : World number two Carlos Alcaraz said he would speak to the ATP about a \"new\" shot clock rule being trialled by the governing body after feeling rushed during his defeat by Briton Jack Draper at the Queen's Club Championships. Alcaraz's preparations for his Wimbledon title defence suffered a setback on Thursday with his 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 loss to Draper in the last 16. The 25-seconds shot clock was previously started only when the chair umpire called the score but the tweak to the rule in the trial means that the countdown to a serve begins almost immediately after a point is concluded. The new regulation, aimed at streamlining game flow and ensuring consistent time management, has been on trial since the French Open concluded and an ATP source told Reuters it will continue in ATP tournaments until the end of the season. Alcaraz said that he had no time to go through his regular routine during the match and that he had expressed his concerns to chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani. \"He told me that there is a new rule, this new thing, that the clock never stops. After the point is finished, the clock is putting on,\" Alcaraz added. \"I think for the players it's something bad. I finish the point at the net and I had no time to ask for balls. I'm not saying to go to a towel and take my time. I feel like I can't ask for the balls. \"It's crazy. I have time just to ask for two balls and no bounces. I've never seen something like that in tennis. \"If you play a long point or finish at the net, you have time just to go for a towel or ask for your routine, ask for, in my case, four balls, I'm concentrating on the next point, just bouncing my bounces and serve as best as I can. \"Today I felt like I was in a rush all the time. I had no time to bounce and do my routine.\" The ATP source said umpires would still have the ability to pause the shot clocks in the event of disruptions beyond player or tournament control. French Open champion Alcaraz was asked if he had spoken to the governing body. \"Not yet, but I will, for sure,\" said the Spaniard, who will now head to Wimbledon, which begins on July 1. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The recent box office success of Kannada cinema at the pan-India level has emboldened filmmakers to integrate unorthodox elements into mainstream commercial cinema. Sandeep Sunkad’s ‘ Shakhahaari ’ is the latest entrant to this list. Subramanya alias Subbanna (Rangayana Raghu) is a good-natured, middle-aged bachelor immersed in running his small hotel. He lives alone but is constantly pestered by his step-brother. Scarred by an unsuccessful relationship when he was younger, Subbanna is reconciled to life-long bachelorhood. His sedate life is turned upside down when Vijay (Vinay Jarimalli), a BSF jawan accused of murdering his wife, escapes police custody and seeks shelter at his residence. Police furiously look for Vijay, while Subbanna struggles to shield him from public gaze. Things turn intense as the local SI (Gopalakrishna Deshpande) hastens the chase in light of crucial revelations. The venture is praiseworthy for being daringly creative. The storyline is challenging and has too many points to deal with but a few gaping holes compromise the plot. Set in the coast, greater efforts were required, especially from the lead cast, to deliver the coastal lingo convincingly. Veteran Rangayana Raghu is brilliant in a nuanced role demanding wholesome acting. He seamlessly traverses through varied emotions. Typecast as a comedian and largely given stereotypical roles with scant regard for his talents, Raghu's recent performances are changing the established notion. After powerful performances in 'Tagaru Palya' and 'Ranga Samudra',' Shakahari' succeeds in extracting the maximum out of him. It might herald a change into more deeper roles in the days to come. Deshpande is also convincing in another pivotal role while Vinay perfectly plays the archetypal jilted lover. Despite its flaws, ‘Shakhahaari’ is worth a watch for its creative plot carried effectively on Raghu’s able shoulders. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Makers of ‘ Abbabba ’ had claimed that their film was inspired by the 2015 runaway Malayalam hit ‘ Adi Kappiyare Kootamani ’. However, ‘ Abbabba ’ is a faithful remake of the original. Akhila (Amrutha Iyengar), who accidentally meets hosteller Dileep (Likith Shetty) in the college canteen, overhears a conversation between his girlfriend Shammu (Anusha Rai) and him. She promises to assist him fulfil his dream if he helps her sneak into his boys’ hostel for five minutes. However, she doesn’t disclose her intention. Determined to marry Shammu, Dileep agrees. They agree that neither Dileep’s friends nor the warden should see her. Minutes after her entry, the situation gets out of hand and chaos ensues. Attempting remakes in the age of OTTs is risky. The narrative requires reworking to make it more locally relevant. Chaitanya doesn’t take risks, but remains faithful to the original. As a result, ‘Abbabba’ remains a passable entertainer for those who have not watched ‘Adi Kappiyare Kootamani’. It is a movie for those who expect laughter. Most of the action takes place inside the boys’ hostel and over the course of two days. It has moments of chaos and confusion. The unpredictable storyline holds one’s attention until the end. Some one-liners and spoofs evoke laughter. The umpteen quirky possibilities emerge as interesting conversations. Narration is plain. Cinematography, music and lyrics are average. Likith, Amrutha Iyengar and Sharath Lohitashwa are convincing in their roles. The performance of other artistes is also impressive. The audience will have to keep logic out of the equation if they really want to enjoy the movie. #Elections2024"

Upon finding out about their marriage, their parents accept the couple on the condition that they marry as per traditions before their family and friends. The couple agree and get married for the second time. But their happiness is short-lived as Ashu grows detached and secretive. Anvi becomes restless and suspects he is having an affair after she witnesses an incident one rainy night. What Ashu is hiding forms the crux of the story. With incessant fights between the couple, lots of melodrama, lousy comedy, cliched dialogues and constant efforts of a cousin to break them up, the film feels more like a TV serial. Finally when the truth is revealed, it is sure to blow one’s top off. Pruthvi Ambaar who plays romantic heroes in most films fails to put on a compelling show in this supposed rom-com. Milana Nagraj, Sudha Belawadi and Tabla Nani impress. Ravi Shankar who is known for his strong performances is disappointing in this one. The film is well shot, the coastal landscapes are a sight for sore eyes (caused by the overly dramatic narrative). The film’s music by Harish R sets an upbeat mood and the well-choreographed under-water song sequence is the centre of attention. Flimsy writing and poor characterisation bogs down a story with a potential to be more progressive. As the film ended I couldn’t help but wonder why it is titled ‘For Registration’. Are the makers promoting registered marriages? Because the film certainly doesn’t seem to promote anything. To add to the confusion, it concludes with the couple deciding to marry for the third time! #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : It is hard to watch an elephant die. Even if it is only on the small screen. Its gentle eyes closed in pain, blood trickling from the single bullet wound in the centre of its forehead, and then, the ungainly collapse of a magnificent beast. ‘Poacher’ begins with the killing of an elephant. As the tale unspools and the deaths pile on, we see at the beginning of every episode, the carcass of the very same animal, killed without remorse for its ivory, rotting, disintegrating and finally becoming a skeleton — a mute witness to human greed. Writer-director Richie Mehta’s new eight-part series follows the ethos and format of his acclaimed Delhi Crime (Netflix) but is much more unflinching in its narration. The series is based on real-life events in 1995 a few years after hunting was made illegal in India when the Kerala forest department uncovered one of the biggest elephant poaching rackets in the country with links to international crime syndicates. A procedural certainly but one with more heart than usual, this is the story of a bunch of dedicated forest officers who give their all to hunt down the criminals and save the elephants. But the series is not without its faults. There are one too many characters and it gets quite confusing. Editing is patchy and some episodes tend to drag. The intense desire to be authentic is appreciated but this reduces the ‘dread factor’ and unholy anticipation that lifts a procedural from its mundanity. Full marks to the cast for the way they have immersed themselves in the story; no one feels out of place. And despite the animals and birds being computer-generated (and not very state-of-the-art), it is a nice touch every now and then to see the world from their viewpoint. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Nothing is as refreshing as a well-made coming-of-age drama. Films like Munna Bhai MBBS , Three Idiots , and Chhichhore , which challenge social stereotypes about education, have been loved by millions. All India Rank is another such film that stands out for its thought-provoking narrative. The film depicts the life of 17-year-old Vivek (Bodhisattva Sharma) who is pressured by his parents to hop onto the IIT bandwagon. For his father, R K Singh (Shashi Bhushan), an IIT degree is not just a step towards a well-paying job but also a status symbol. A reluctant Vivek moves out of town for IIT coaching. As he begins his grind, he befriends Sarika (Samta Sudhikshna), another student at the coaching centre. His parents struggle through turbulent times, hoping for the best for their son’s future. Popular stand-up comedian Varun Grover has picked up a pertinent topic in his directorial debut. As an IITian himself, Grover’s attempt to break societal misconceptions is admirable. Dialogues are brilliant at times and the message is subtly conveyed. However, unlike its predecessors mentioned earlier, All India Rank fails to keep the audience hooked at all times. It neither has Farhans, Rajus, an ‘All Is Well’, a Munna-Circuit combo nor a thrilling finale to make for a wholesome entertainer. The result is partial boredom though the film is under two hours. Sharma impresses as the stereotypical introverted teenager while Geet plays a mother similar to her character in 12th Fail . The star performer is R K Sharma who is delightful in different shades. All India Rank is good but it seems like a missed opportunity to carve out a classic! #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Not all heroes wear capes and Yami Gautam, the female lead of the film, does not even wear a bulletproof helmet. But that is understandable. Cinema doesn’t need to adhere to the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of an insurgency operation. Article 370 weaves together multiple events in Kashmir from 2016 to 2019, when Article 370 was abrogated. The story revolves around how Zoni Haksar (Yami Gautam), an intelligence officer and home secretary Rajeswari (Priya Mani) handle the events leading to the abrogation. Of course, every director is entitled to cinematic liberties. However, in this film, Aditya Suhas Jambhale, begins taking cinematic liberties right from the start. History has it that Maharajah Harisingh was reluctant to join India or Pakistan. He aligned himself with India only after he was attacked by the Pakistanis. But the makers of ‘370’ want you to believe Nehru delayed the accession until his friend Sheikh Abdullah was allowed power. There are two different ways to view this film. One way to look at it is as an action thriller. Through this lens, the film does a fine job. It ensures that it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The editing is slick and doesn’t drive you to boredom, especially during discussions on the legal aspects of Article 370. The camera work and music are commendable. Casting Yami as the intel expert and Priyamani as the home secretary is a stroke of genius, adding a much-needed balance to what would otherwise be a predominantly masculine film. When you look at it from the perspectives of balance and accuracy, it disappoints. Arguments to preserve the article are given no attention. Was it sacrificed because it would have slowed the pace of storytelling? Or did the director not want to counter an opinion that he did not believe in? JioCinemas being the producer, it's not hard to guess. The creative team showed contempt for all the institutions of democracy, such as the opposition, and the journalists. They were all caricatured as conspiratorial and anti-national. While elements of drama and action are aplenty, the film lacks the intelligence and the genuineness needed to sustain a conversation. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : After ‘Matha’ (2006) and ‘Eddelu Manjunatha’ (2009) Guruprasad has teamed up with Jaggesh for ‘Ranganayaka’. It had aroused curiosity as the last two films shook the audience’s sensibilities, thanks to strong content. ‘Ranganayaka’ narrates the story of filmmaker Guruprasad who was born as Padmanabha Sharma in his previous life. He delves into his past after being hypnotised in a television show. Inspired by the moving picture by the Lumiere brothers, Sharma attempts to make the first ever moving picture in India in Kannada language in 1911. He fails in his mission as many forces block the attempt. The flick starts as a satire, but soon crosses the limits of this genre. At times, absurdity reaches its peak as scenes and dialogues lack context. Most dialogues are sourced from WhatsApp text messages. The conversations between characters are long but the story never progresses. Double entendre in conversations between Jaggesh and Rachitha Mahalakshmi spoils cinematic experience. Guruprasad loses control over everything as the storyline becomes directionless especially in the second half. The role of the psychiatrist played by Yograj Bhat is absolutely irrelevant to the plot. Two ill-timed songs and exhibition of love for Kannada in excess only add to the frustration of the audience. The only two factors that draw attention are Jaggesh’s performance and some witty one-liners. Anoop Seelin deserves a mention for his music composition. The flick doesn’t narrate who blocked Sharma and the growth of Kannada film industry. His mockery of numerous artistes and directors lacks justification and is in poor taste. The purpose of filmmaking is to entertain, instruct and enlighten the audience. Guruprasad uses ‘Ranganayaka’ to express his frustration against forces hiding their identity. By the time the show ends, the audience’s frustration reaches a boiling point. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : How do you title a film? Seasoned filmmaker Yogaraj Bhat gets full marks for picking Karataka and Damanaka, names of the sly foxes from the Panchatantra, to title a tale full of intrigue, chicanery, deceit and drama. Virupaksha (Shivarajkumar) and Basavaraju (Prabhu Deva) play the said foxes. Imprisoned for theft and fraud, they also build a reputation for resourcefulness and ingenuity. Impressed, the jailer sends them on parole to his hometown Nandikoluru, a fictitious town in north Karnataka. Their mission is to convince the jailer's father to leave the village, which the jailer considers a graveyard. Water scarcity is Nandikoluru’s biggest problem, and it is exacerbated by the hooliganism of the local MLA (Rangayana Raghu). Villagers desperately await the village fair, hoping it will help them find a way to solve their problems. Egged on by a promise of freedom, and the temptations of newly kindled romance, the foxes summon up all their cunning to take on a tough game. The basic sketch of the film — a multi-starrer with two good-hearted thieves being sent on a difficult mission to a barren village — comes from the classic 'Sholay' template. The thieves have contrasting character traits and begin wooing two village girls — all as expected! However, the similarities stop here. Unlike 'Sholay,' the plot increasingly focuses on the two heroes and revolves more around their internal contradictions and moral dilemmas. 'Karataka Damanaka' is a masala entertainer, and in that sense unlike the more emotional Yogaraj Bhat films. However, his creativity shines in the unconventional treatment, though perhaps not to everyone's taste. The plot is creative, unpredictable and peaks with well-timed comedy, delivered with a north Karnataka flavour. 'Karataka Damanaka' planks on the strong chemistry between the protagonists, vital for multi-starrers. However, the narrative lags at times and is over-dependent on them, since the villains are not portrayed strongly. The heroines are just namesake characters, and the supporting characters don’t have much to do. The story is sometimes monotonous, and like in most commercial films, improbable at times. The plot weakens towards the end and the climax leaves much to be desired. The film stands out for showcasing a different Shivarajkumar. As the actor confessed in an interview, his more recent films, 'Bhajarangi,' 'Mufti,' Tagaru,' and 'Ghost', have been dark. It is refreshing to see the 61-year-old in a light role, which he plays with panache. Prabhu Deva, legendary for his dancing skills, adapts well to the demands of his Kannada role. His dancing skills are on display in the songs 'Deega Digri' and 'Hithalaka Karibeda Maava.' Priya Anand and Nishvika do well but are given an extremely limited canvas. Ravishankar is relatively free from his typical Arumuga-style character play. V Harikrishna's power-packed music is one of the strong points as it sustains the momentum of the story, especially early on in the film. 'Karataka Damanaka' is a mixed bag. It takes up a time-tested template and works with a blockbuster pair, but the plot slackens and goes out of focus. It might still be an enjoyable watch for fans of Shivarajkumar and Prabhu Deva looking for some fun. Cut-off box - #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : I have holes to punch in the documentary’s very title ‘The Indrani Mukerjea Story: Buried Truth’. The true crime series on the Sheena Bora murder case, which sent shockwaves through Mumbai’s high society, doesn’t uncover anything substantial that’s not already out in public. At best, it is an extended newsreel that packs 10 years of twists and turns in four episodes. By naming the series after former media executive Indrani Mukerjea, the prime accused, who’s out on bail after 6.5 years in custody, it sort of gives legitimacy to her ‘truths’. Worse, she is the only accused among her driver and her two ex-husbands, including then-media baron Peter Mukerjea, who came on record. Naming it after Sheena, first revealed as Indrani’s sister and later her daughter, would have been sensible. This is something Vidhie, Indrani’s daughter from her second husband and co-accused Sanjeev Khanna, reminds the viewers too – a bright and newly-engaged 25-year-old girl was killed. And if Indrani’s belief is anything to go by, Sheena is still alive! What the series does lay out well is that families aren’t perfect and relationships are conditional. All the sympathy that Indrani’s son Mikhail scores for being ‘tortured’ by his mother evaporates the moment he reveals he bought an SUV when his ailing grandparents were struggling to afford medicines. Mikhail was using me for money, Indrani comments on their relationship. Through Vidhie, the series also shines light on children from broken families. Rahul Mukerjea, Sheena’s fiance and Peter’s son, declined to participate but his phone call recordings lend heft to the narrative. Rahul had recorded conversations with his father as the latter did not take Sheena’s disappearance seriously. The story of the Bora-Mukherjea family is stranger than fiction but is watchable despite lack of novelty, especially if you haven’t followed the case. #Elections2024"

It was the first film on the subject to be made in India. I was similarly amused after watching Blink , written and directed by debut filmmaker, Srinidhi Bengaluru. An edge-of-the seat sci-fi thriller drama, Blink follows Apurva (Dheekshith Shetty) who survives on money earned from doing odd-jobs and is also financially dependent on his girlfriend, Swapna (Mandara Battalahalli). They have shared interests in art and theatre. Although Apurva’s life isn’t luxurious, it is comfortable. However, when a peculiar middle-aged man enters his life upon discovering his unique ability to control his blinking, his life turns upside down. The man continues to follow Apurva and gives him hints about his dark past. He also begins seeing a man who looks like himself. Suresh Anagalli and Dheekshith Shetty in 'Blink'. Credit: Special Arrangement The film takes some time to pick up but once it gathers pace, it doesn't slow down. The 136-minute film switches continuously between the present and the past. The creation of time travel and suspense, coupled with strong emotions will make you extremely curious. As the film progresses, it begins to get complicated, sometimes even leaving you confused. But its beauty lies in the complications. Blink is not an ordinary commercial film. It is brilliantly written. The time travel narrative plays out seamlessly along with music, poetry and theatre. The effort that went into making it a technically sound film is abundantly apparent. The VFX is not jarring. The music and cinematography deserve a mention. Chaitra J Achar is compelling in her role. Dheekshith Shetty whose previous film, KTM was unimpressive, impresses in this one. All the other actors stand out in their performances. For a first-time filmmaker to deliver a film like Blink is astounding. After 2023 gave the Kannada industry fresh faces, 2024 continues to surprise. A new generation of promising filmmakers — in both art-house and mainstream narratives — is rising. #Elections2024"

Madhavan is brilliant as the villain, while Devgan’s timeless portrayal of the hero is impressive. The actors make up for the predictability of the script by doing justice to their roles. The film is the story of a family which is under attack by a man (Madhavan). He takes control of the daughter through black magic. The once-happy child has now become the puppet of the evil conspirator. The child, under the influence of evil, tries to commit acts which put both the child and the family in harm’s way. The father (Ajay Devgan) must do what he can to save her and his family. Amit Triveni’s music is commendable and brings the film together quite well.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Over-romanticisation of struggle is one of the biggest problems in cinema. It fails to invoke empathy towards the characters and often feels like a mockery of real-life issues. Santhosh Anandram’s Yuva also has a similar problem. The film begins with a closed-door meeting in an engineering college. The meeting sees authorities discussing gang wars between two groups of students — out-of-towners who live in the college hostel and locals. Yuvaraj (Yuva Rajkumar) is a quick-tempered final-year student. He is also a professional wrestler which aids him in winning gang wars. Circumstances see him taking up a delivery boy job after graduation. Why an engineering graduate, who is also a professional wrestler, ends up as a delivery boy forms the crux of the story. The movie tries to tackle multiple problems — conflict between hostel students and locals, issues faced by delivery agents, stock market fraud, middle class problems and corruption in the sports industry. All these issues are woven into a story of a father-son relationship. However, the movie fails to address the problems and create a larger impact. A solution to all of them is to beat up the opponent, according to the makers. The idea of showcasing the issues faced by an average middle-class family is lost in the chaos. Anandram’s films are known for their dialogues with mass appeal. Yuva too is full of such dialogues which can come across as tasteless. Yuva Rajkumar is striking in his action-packed debut. However, his facial expressions are unchanging throughout the film. It is not necessary that a hot-headed person does not feel any other emotion. The wrestling practice and match sequences featuring Kishore are remarkable and well choreographed. It would remind one of Karm Chawla’s boxing drama, 10 , featuring Vinay Rajkumar. Kishore elevates the film with his magnetic presence. Gopalkrishna Deshpande continues to impress with each film. Saptami Gowda somehow doesn't fit into her character well. The romantic sequences seem half-baked with no chemistry between the two actors. To conclude, Yuva is an action-packed entertainer but is let down by too many elements. #Elections2024"

On mugs, on graffiti-ridden walls, in art galleries, on T-shirts — I have spotted a car sticker too, right here in Bengaluru. Frida Kahlo finally gets a documentary worth her legacy. “I paint because I need to,” she says at the beginning of the film and the enduring magic of her art is a testament to this sentiment. She of the trailblazing unibrow stare — the defiant feminist who didn’t care if she was one, the surrealist who didn’t want to be labelled so — the exceptional Mexican painter of self-portraits in vibrant dreamscapes (though she disagrees and says her paintings were expressions of her real life that was neither dreamy nor surrealist). The documentary comes alive not just because of its inventive animation of Frida’s famous artworks and the slow staining of archival footage but also because of the artist’s unconventional thoughts, her sometimes cheeky, other times blunt but always penetrating observations of life and people, selected from her illustrated diary and performed viscerally by voice artist Fernanda Echevarría del Rivero. There’s a punchy, earthy quality to the delivery, which gives the viewer the feel of live commentary — as if Frida herself is the third person making snide remarks on her life unfolding before her eyes — be it her life-changing accident, her passion for Diego Rivera, her artist husband and habitual womaniser, her constant physical suffering and her many affairs with both men and women. Frida’s laconic humour about the French love for lazing around in cafes will make you chuckle while her intrinsic stoicism about pain, her constant companion, will make you marvel. A must-watch, not just if you have always admired her but also because it makes you feel as if you are in the presence of inexplicable greatness. #Elections2024"

Despite being the youngest in the family, he takes on the big task of shouldering family responsibilities. He develops a liking towards Indhu, who he rents a small portion of his house to as a tenant. Indhu reciprocates his feelings but her MA thesis on Govardhan’s life and family breaks them apart. The story proceeds in a predictable manner, pegged on betrayal and hurt. It lacks emotional depth. Some of the fight sequences are woven forcibly to give the hero a ‘superhero’ touch. All the actors manage to deliver their best. Mrunal’s performance is subtle and convincing while Deverakonda is over the top sometimes. The climactic conclusion falls flat. It is formulaic and the execution is weak. The film could have benefitted from more light-hearted moments.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Appa I Love You , named after the superhit song from the film ‘Chowka’ (2017), fails to live up to its hype. It begins with a childless couple - Rahul (Prem) and Kavya (Manvita Kamath) - visiting an orphanage with the intention of adopting a child. There, they bump into Dharmanna (Tabla Nani). The good-hearted senior citizen has a lively personality and a magnetic pull that makes him a crowd favourite. The film then chronicles Dharmanna’s journey and his bond with his son. It highlights the issue of children abandoning their aged parents. The film begins on a promising note with its realistic portrayal of pertinent problems. At times, it is reminiscent of ‘Ambi Ning Vayassaytho’ (2017). However, ‘Appa I Love You’ lacks the subtlety and realism inherent in the Ambareesh-starrer. The film’s problem is in its black-and-white narrative. The preachy tone and the vilification of Dharmanna’s son and daughter-in-law trivialise the complex problem faced by senior citizens. The occasional humour works well but is severely underused. Tabla Nani brings in the right mix of energy and emotion for his role. Mostly known for small roles, he truly shines as the protagonist. However, with little support from elsewhere, it becomes a one-man show. Prem is impressive in a short cameo. The same is also true of Manvita, who incidentally featured in the song in ‘Chowka’. Except for the introductory song, others are just superimposed for the sake of it, hurting the tempo further. With repackaged content and crude execution, one has little to lose by skipping the film. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Aavesham in a manner satirises other Indian mass hits, especially those featuring big stars. Nonetheless, it’s a mass action movie with sequences a physicist might disagree with. The good thing about this Jithu Madhavan film is that it doesn’t take itself seriously, just like his debut film Romancham, a horror comedy that was a super hit. It revolves around three students studying in a Bengaluru college that is ridden with ragging incidents, especially by a group of seniors with “local support” and goons backing them. The trio’s wish to exact revenge for the atrocities they face lands them in bigger trouble. It even brings them face-to-face with the city’s underworld. Fahadh Faasil is introduced as underworld kingpin, Ranga. He is comical, loveable and scary at the same time. He has a Kannada accent that’s decently executed. The unpredictability of Faasil plays a vital role in making the movie an entertainer. It isn’t surprising that Faasil steals the show. It looks as though he was given free rein by the director to do whatever he wished to in the scenes. Sajin Gopu as the right hand of Ranga delivers his career-best performance so far. The three students — Pranav, Midhun and Roshan – also deliver compelling performances. Jithu Madhavan along with Sushin Shyam (background score and music) and Samir Thahir (cinematography) together make the film a thorough entertainer. However, the film falls short in a few aspects. Apart from some inconsequential roles, the film has zero women’s representation. The second half of the film is unnecessarily slow paced. Some cuts felt abrupt and some transitions didn’t make sense, but overall, those don't hamper the movie experience. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Bade Miyan Chote Miyan (BMCM) is one of those Bollywood flicks that could serve as an example for bad filmmaking. Ali Abbas Zafar, known for successful films in the commercial space, experiments with a military drama that is undoubtedly mediocre. BMCM continues Bollywood's attempts at exploiting 'patriotism' for commercial success without much substance. The film is about Captain Firoz (Akshay Kumar) and Captain Rakesh (Tiger Shroff), the best court-martialed officers. They are guided by Colonel Adil Shekhar Azad (Ronit Bose Roy) to rescue the country from a rogue scientist-entrepreneur Kabir (Prithviraj Sukumaran). Kabir wants to dismantle a package called ‘Karan Kavach’ that India has developed to protect itself from Pakistan and China. The flick takes off with a masked man hijacking the package from a troop. The first half establishes the background of Firoz and Rakesh, while the second half details the background of Kabir. It describes what compels him to part ways with the two captains and nurture a grudge against the Indian army. As expected, good triumphs over evil in the end. Right from the first scene, the filmmaker challenges common sense and logic. Until the end, it is just noise and fury, and signifies nothing. It is so fast paced that there is hardly any time for the audience to relate to the story. Out of the 164-minute running time, about 90% is dedicated to action sequences, which are monotonous. The film appears like a recycled version of 'Robot', 'War', 'Jawan', 'Pathaan' and Marvel films. While the performance of the lead actors is satisfactory, cinematography, VFX and background music deserve no mention. Even star power can’t save this unbearable, snooze fest - a pointless military drama. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Sports biographies have made sporadic appearances in the Hindi mainstream cinema. Irrespective of India’s cricket obsession, there have been more prominent biopics of wrestlers and athletes. Maidaan joins this list. It chronicles what sports historians call the golden era of football (1951-70). During this time, India regularly appeared in both Olympics and Asian Games and managed to perform well. India had also reached the semifinals in the 1956 Olympics and won the gold medal in Jakarta Asian Games. Maidaan is based on the true story of Syed Abdul Rahim, known as the architect of this golden period. The film begins with the coverage of the Indian team’s defeat at the hands of Yugoslavia at the Olympics. Some online claims suggest that the then Nehru government did not provide shoes for the Olympic games but in reality, many players of the Indian team were more comfortable playing barefoot. S A Rahim wanted to build a world class Indian team from scratch. He dribbled and tackled the petty politicking of the sports federations and lack of resources to put Indian football on the world map. Director Amit Sharma has chronicled this journey very well. He has utilised the resources of storytelling to give a wholesome experience. He uses sports commentary to explain nuances of the game which may have escaped the attention of the football-agnostic viewer. Films based on sports bank on two critical elements — emotion (generally a motivating speech), which arrives before the climax, and cinematography. The emotional peak is expertly crafted and remains faithful to Rahim’s character who is depicted as a reserved individual. But the cinematography could have been better. There aren’t many gripping shots of sporting moments. Frequent use of reaction shots of people listening to the radio commentary becomes somewhat tiresome. Art direction and costume designs have been meticulously recreated. Ajay Devgn delivers a credible performance as S A Rahim. His portrayal of a soft spoken but self assured character is marvellous. A R Rahman is brilliant with his music, especially in the climax, which stirs one’s emotions. Overall, the film is a brave effort that showcases to the many cricket-loving Indians, the challenges other sports have faced in the country. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : This Elvis did not want to leave the building but was forced to. And the music played on, long after he left. Netflix's new biopic on Amar Singh Chamkila, one of Punjab's most popular singers of the turbulent 80s, who had been given the moniker 'Elvis of Punjab', hits all the right notes. Imitiaz Ali (whose return to form is such a pleasure), A R Rahman and Diljit Dosanjh work in tandem to create the kind of immersive sincerity that originally made these artistes big names. The Dalit singer, who was shot dead at the age of 27 near a small village in Jalandhar in 1988, was a figure who inspired as much adoration as revulsion. The singer-composer, labelled 'ganda banda' (sleazy lad), unabashedly wrote lyrics choking with rampant sexual innuendos (mostly involving devar-bhabhi romps, husbands and others' wives carrying on sleazy affairs and the like). Their casual objectification of women ('will knead you like a dough' goes the translation of a popular ditty) may be distasteful for Gen Z ears but the songs broke all records and brought him extraordinary fame, which eventually led to his and his wife's gruesome killing — an unsolved murder till date. The narrative is poetic and layered with flashbacks, photographs and video snaps of the real Chamkila. The screenplay bravely and politically incorrectly explores the grey areas of desire and how women respond to sexual innuendo when no one's watching. Diljit brings a rare innocence and authenticity to his portrayal of Chamkila, which makes it really hard to dislike the singer, despite his many obvious faults. Parineeti Chopra, who plays his docile but stoic wife, is competent as is the supporting cast. The songs are earworms and the only grouse is the unnecessary distraction of the Hindi supers (lyrics projected on the screen for extra measure). A must-watch. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : ‘Thalaimai Seyalagam’ is a compelling show that originated from a great concept. However, it falls short in some crucial areas, which makes it difficult to recommend for the average viewer. If you’re well-versed in politics, the history of Tamil Nadu and naxalism, this show will be a decent thriller for you. However, if you look at it strictly from an entertainment perspective, you are in for disappointment. Let me begin with what’s likeable about the show. I was pleasantly surprised by the convincing performance of Kishore as a chief minister accused of corruption. Sriya Reddy as Kotravai was also impressive as a friend to the CM and an advisor to the cabinet. Kani Kusruti’s Durga is a compelling character but is let down by mediocre dubbing. Despite great performances from all the actors, shabby editing prevented them from achieving a rather believable portrayal of their characters. Amudhavalli, portrayed by Ramya Nambeeshan, also had the same fate. It made it clear that it is the editing that makes the series suffer. This is not to be taken lightly. ‘Thalamai Seyalagam’ sets up a pretty layered universe that is brutal and unforgiving. In a way it reminds you of some of the best shows in the world. What, however, doesn’t work is the way it tries to overstretch plotlines for a viewer who is already overwhelmed with one too many characters and storylines. No attempt is made to explain the relationships between the characters and the show director doesn’t make the viewer comfortable in their chair. Although this could be intentional, the show offers no surprises or plotlines that can be considered iconic or defining. The climax of the show is enjoyable if you are not expecting twists or surprises. Sriya Reddy is a treat to watch. The plotline is good but predictable at the same time. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The third season of ‘Bridgerton’ is all about Penelope Featherington. Nicola Coughlan as Penelope steals the show right from the very beginning. This season is based on Julia Quinn’s fourth book in her Regency romance series, titled ‘Romancing Mister Bridgerton’. In the first few episodes, the protagonist goes through a stunning transformation, taking complete charge of her wardrobe. She ditches the bright citrus colours of her mother’s liking and opts for mellow hues of green, paired with cleavage hugging necklines, dainty jewellery and soft curls. However, her glow-up is not to please society. Penelope is aware that she is a stunner, and is ready to let the ‘ton’ in on the secret. Aside from the many splendid outfits this season, Queen Charlotte’s hair deserves a special mention. Her intricate and elaborate hairstyles, some fixed with sparkling crystal swans, make more of a statement than the queen herself. While the chemistry between Penelope and Colin (Luke Newton) is a joy to watch — filled with banter, stolen glances and a little bit of spice — it’s the female friendships in the show that stand out. Be it the damaged-yet-tender friendship between Eloise and Penelope or the endearing and comical friendship between Queen Charlotte and Lady Danbury, the show makes an effort to offer a real-life portrayal of the layered nature of female friendships. A personal favourite this season was the newly blossomed friendship between Eloise and Cressida Cowper — while the people around them find the pairing odd, the young ladies complement each other perfectly. Seeing Anthony and Kate back on screen brought a familiar sense of comfort. The highly-favoured couple from last season still manages to make viewers swoon every time they’re together. However, the good acting and the ever-so-sweet ‘friends to lovers’ trope tends to get lost in the multiple storylines — eight in total — blossoming alongside the main love story. Every minute is filled to the brim with miscellaneous plots and Easter eggs for future seasons. One can only hope this doesn’t continue into the second part of the season. It won’t be easy to match the effortless charm of the second season of the series. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : ‘Badavara maklu belibeku kanro’ (children of the poor must prosper too), Daali Dhananjaya’s lines from an interview — they later went viral — reflect the roles he chooses to play. Common man roles are Dhananjaya’s forte. Be it Rathnakara in Rathnan Prapancha or Shankar in Badava Rascal , he excels in them. Once again, he plays a character from a lower middle class family trying to meet ends. Dhananjaya’s character, Kotee, is the sole bread-winner of a family that lives in Janata City. He runs a small packers and movers business and drives a cab when business is dull. He is a virtuous person — he never lies, steals or cheats. And yet he faces a hundred hurdles. Despite not wanting to take a loan from thug Dinoo Saavkaar (a wonderful Ramesh Indira), Kotee finds himself buried under a huge pile of debt. To break free, he has to do one of Saavkaar’s dirty jobs. Kannada television’s celebrated figure Parameshwar Gundkal's debut film as director feels like a soap opera. Kotee makes sure to pay rent on his vehicle to Saavkaar every day. This everyday routine gets the treatment of a daily soap. The encounters begin with Kotee handing over Rs 2,000 to Saavakar. And each time you expect the plot to unfold, it doesn’t. It is as adamant as its protagonist. With a runtime of nearly three hours, when the plot finally takes off with a clever connection to something from the first half, the audience no longer remembers it. And this is not a serial to show a loud flashback! Kotee has some of our best actors who try to elevate the film with their performances. A charming Dhananjaya strives to save the film but the poor writing bogs him down. The camera moves around Bengaluru in disguise of a fictional Janata City. Drone shots capturing the different moods of the city along with Vasuki Vaibhav's music add some colour to the film. The director brings in an impulsive disorder with an urge to steal, kleptomania, into the narrative, but it does little to add excitement to the story. Despite many attempts to keep it engaging, Kotee ends up as a snooze fest accompanied by a slap fest. The dramatic sound of each slap still rings in my head. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : OctaFX, a prominent international online brokerage firm, has recently found itself ensnared in a controversy in India. The broker has been facing allegations of providing illegal trading services, but it’s quickly becoming clear that it is not that simple. In this article, we will study and dissect the supposed OctaFX ban in India, shedding light on whether these accusations are legitimate, or one big misunderstanding. OctaFX stands as a well-established international company renowned for extending trading services across the globe. OctaFX has garnered a fantastic reputation, boasting an array of industry awards which include the prestigious 'Best FX Broker India 2022' and the 'Most Reliable Broker Asia 2023. Furthermore, the broker's commitment to delivering high-quality services is clear thanks to its international presence spanning over 180 countries. Despite its widespread critical acclaim, recent accusations have cast a shadow of doubt over OctaFX's standing in India. Indian authorities have initiated actions against the company, including the provisional attachment of funds purportedly belonging to OctaFX. Naturally, these measures have prompted concerns and among traders and prospective investors, but experts following these events have begun to express their scepticism. Perhaps the most important area of scepticism has concerned the identification of the seized funds, which have been linked to OctaFX India Pvt. Ltd. Despite its similar name to OctaFX, this is an entity entirely separate from the one that owns OctaFX. Once this distinction was uncovered, it raised questions regarding OctaFX's involvement in any illicit activities in India. In reality, it appears that the issue revolves around malevolent fraudsters exploiting OctaFX's name. It has been speculated that it is with the intention of deploying counterfeit trading apps designed to steal the funds of unsuspecting traders and investors. So, the question remains: is OctaFX legal in India, and if so, why has it not pursued an Indian licence? Shouldn’t you worry that OctaFX is banned in India? You absolutely shouldn’t, and to understand this, it is imperative to recognise that this question extends beyond OctaFX and encompasses the entire Indian Forex market. First, it’s essential to understand that the Forex market operates as a decentralised global entity, facilitating trading around the clock on every weekday. This leaves it ranking as one of the largest and most liquid markets worldwide, and any attempts to impose regulations upon it would greatly impact these essential characteristics. To illustrate, local regulators are known to impose rigorous rules and regulations on Forex brokers seeking licences. These regulatory frameworks impose stringent trading conditions, limit tradable instruments a broker can offer, frown upon promotional offers, and even restrict collaboration with liquidity providers. Naturally, such restrictions can have dire consequences for brokers such as OctaFX. In light of these challenges, it is unsurprising that many international Forex brokers opt not to pursue local licences in India. Instead, they may choose to acquire licences in jurisdictions with such regulatory frameworks that do not impede their competitive edge in the global Forex market. This way, brokers such as OctaFX can continue to scale without boundaries, whilst still holding the necessary certifications to prove their legitimacy. Now that you understand the negative impact of pursuing an Indian broker license, you may be asking which licenses OctaFX holds. Well, OctaFX stands out for its possession of licences from reputable regulatory bodies such as South Africa’s Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) and Cyprus’ Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC). These licences are highly sought after, signifying OctaFX's commitment to adhering to regulatory standards around the world. Overall, it can safely be said that OctaFX continues to operate in India, and it shows no signs that this will change in the future. The company continued to offer its services to traders and investors in India, and its reputation remains relatively unaffected by the false allegations it has been subject to. Remember to keep a keen eye out for any fake trading apps operated by fraudsters and use only official websites and apps belonging to brokers. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : An insurance cover for your car should have built-in advantages and you need to ensure you pick one that offers both comprehensive cover and ease of claim, advises Jayanthi Madhukar. Without an insurance cover, experts say it is not advisable to take the car on the roads. Financial safeguards for your vehicle in case of physical damage, bodily injuries, and third-party liabilities, ensure peace of mind. It is mandatory for every vehicle to have an insurance cover. Today, insurance companies, like Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company, incorporate technology and safety features into the car insurance packages, making it easier for claims. There are features like cashless claim settlement, motor-on-the-spot, and online claim filing, which make it hassle-free when you are stressed out about car damages. So, whenever you are shopping for a good car insurance cover , make sure that these features are available. While it may seem unimportant when you don’t have any claims to make, their importance and significance come up in the unfortunate event of having to claim for accident-related damages. In these hectic times, matters such as insurance should be hassle-free – both, to buy/renew, and claim, for settlement. It is therefore very prudent to go through all the clauses carefully before buying a policy and paying for more inclusions. It is also prudent to ensure you buy a cover from a company that has a good service track record. You don’t want to wait for a long time for the surveyor in case of a claim. Also, a resourceful and knowledgeable staff will help you analyse the risks involved and get the sort of coverage you need.* Here are some major features that make for a good insurance cover: This is a convenient feature to have in a car insurance cover. The cashless claim settlement is a facility provided by the car insurance company in which the insurer is associated with authorized garages, which are referred to as network garages. If you want to repair your insured vehicle, you can take it to a network garage to avail cashless claim facility. You won’t be liable to pay for the vehicle’s repair - the insurer will cover all the expenses on your behalf. This is way better than the reimbursement claim settlement. * In the latter, when you go to repair your insured vehicle in a garage, you are required to pay the whole amount at first. After which you should send all the relevant invoices and documents to the insurer; failure to produce any invoice will result in rejection of your insurance claim. Moreover, reimbursement claims take time to be settled. Hence, cashless claim settlement is better as it saves valuable time and you are also not required to pay the whole amount upfront. * Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company has the cashless claim settlement facility, one of the salient features of the car insurance cover. With the help of this facility, many of the activities will be taken care of by the insurer itself, such as getting your car towed and analysing the repair estimate generated by the garage. * ^ Claims are subject to terms and conditions set forth under car insurance policy This is a mobile-based motor insurance claim settlement service, which allows you to settle your vehicle insurance claims up to Rs 30,000 for private cars and Rs 10,000 for two-wheelers within a short duration of time. * With Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company, all you need to do is use their App to file for claims, click and upload pictures of the damage done to your vehicle and receive the claim amount in your bank account instantly. This is a technology-driven feature that offers a stress-free experience in case of damage or accident. * The Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company has a trouble-free process of raising a cashless claim. All one has to do is contact the insurer and if need be, contact the police and file a FIR. The insurer reaches the accident spot and arranges for your vehicle to be towed to the nearest network garage where a thorough inspection is carried out. An estimate is given by the garage and after approval, repairs are undertaken. The garage provides all the invoices to the insurance company and later, the insurer will also examine the bills and the vehicle. While the policyholder is liable to pay the deductible and the depreciation amount, the rest of the amount will be directly paid by the insurance company to the garage. In case your car has been damaged beyond repair, the company will pay the market value of the car after calculating the depreciation value of the vehicle. * ^ Claims are subject to terms and conditions set forth under car insurance policy Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company’s special feature – the cashless claim – is one of their most appreciated and valuable features in a plethora of stress-free facilities that are available with some of their car insurance products. * The App-based claim service can be a huge bonus for those on the move and not having the time for elaborate paperwork or waiting for a surveyor. With the App on your smartphone, making a claim and seeing it through till settlement is simple and can be tracked easily. Convenience and speed are the most sought-after aspects of insurance and many may rank these factors high on their agenda while choosing a product and company. As more vehicles hit the roads, more innovative products too might make their way into the market. Going forward, as technology makes it easier to transact and insurance becomes system-driven, tech-enabled products of companies such as Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company may find favour with most buyers. * * Standard T&C Apply Insurance is the subject matter of solicitation.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : With high inflation rates and less than satisfying returns offered by banks on deposits and savings accounts, it is getting harder for most Indians to achieve their financial goals, both short-term and long-term. Searching for viable supplementary sources of income, more and more people turn to the investment options that offer low entry costs and potential immediate gains, such as Forex and contracts for differences (CFD). However, to make a successful start on this journey, you will first have to choose a reliable financial platform. Here, we list four compelling arguments for choosing a globally recognized financial broker as a necessary stepping stone on your path to success. Savings accounts and deposits are not enough With dropping financial savings and rising costs of basic goods, many Indian households currently face a challenging economic environment. In 2023, traditional saving options such as fixed and recurring deposits proved insufficient to outmatch the yearly inflation rate. This situation mostly affected the financial stability of those with lower to medium income, who spend a large part of their earnings on necessities. Tough economic conditions call for more energetic approaches to wealth management. In recent years, more and more people in India turn to investing as a proactive way to outpace inflation. One of the reasons for this is the growing popularity of digital financial services such as Octa , a time-proven financial platform with a wide scope of tradable assets and investment options, including Forex. Unlike many other investment choices, Forex offers reasonably fast returns, which is especially relevant to those investors who have neither a large starting capital on their hands nor the time to spare. Forex trading is a viable option to outpace the inflation Investing in the Forex market is one of the most popular paths to gaining consistent supplementary income. It provides a dynamic investing environment with diverse opportunities for making consistent profits and doesn’t involve the burden of high entry costs. You can mitigate the risks and hone your trading skills by creating a demo account. This approach will allow you to gain hands-on experience by trading with virtual funds for as long as you like without any danger of losing your real-life investment. When you get to know the ins and outs of the Forex market and start making consistent gains on your demo account, you can dive into real-life trading and apply your theoretical knowledge to practice. In Forex trading there is only one factor—apart from your own skills and experience—that can affect your performance: the choice of a broker. Picking a trustworthy, globally recognized financial broker would be a perfect start to your investment journey. Below are four reasons why choosing a Forex broker with global presence is the way to go for those adopting a proactive approach to wealth management and consistent financial gains. 1. Advanced security capabilities The fear of losing their funds to fraud or unscrupulous financial practices is looming over many current and prospective traders alike. There is only one way to get rid of this fear once and for good: you have to find an experienced and trustworthy broker with a holistic approach to the security of user data and clients’ funds. This way, you will be able to fully rely on your broker and make investments without a shadow of a doubt in your mind. A globally recognised and time-proven broker since 2011, Octa uses segregated user accounts to differentiate between its working capital and its client investments. By keeping its customers' funds in segregated accounts, the broker ensures that the clients' trading capital is not used for any purpose other than to meet the trading or margin requirements. Being exposed to international security standards and practices is instrumental for brokerage businesses in providing a safe trading experience to their customers. To ensure state-of-the-art anti-fraud protection, secure and fast withdrawal of funds, and compliance with the latest cybersecurity protocols, a financial platform needs to regularly update its knowledge bases, follow the latest recommendations from international institutions, and actively research the most recent industry-specific cases. Global brokers have a much easier access to these advantages. By keeping their know-your-customer practices and user verification protocols up to date, globally recognized brokers make sure that no money laundering or other illegitimate activities take place on their platforms, which is crucial in establishing a safe zone for a large and diverse community of traders and investors. 2. Superior investing experience Imagine a famous athlete who has gained an international renown by successfully playing in some of the best leagues on the planet. Such a player would be regarded as a highly desirable asset by any team because his diverse experience is matched only by his outstanding achievements. The same is true for financial brokers: the more international experience they have, the better. By adopting best international practices and adhering to international standards, they improve user experience to drive better customer satisfaction. Globally recognised brokers have the resources and incentives to invest in developing and implementing new technology. They can scale these solutions to drive efficient international operations and customise them to meet the specific needs of users in each region. With their extensive, well-rounded experience, globally recognized financial brokers boast quite a few advantages over their competitors, including cross-platform support of their applications, continuous improvement of user experience, and establishing the highest standards in customer service. 3. Higher liquidity Brokers serve as intermediaries between financial institutions and retail investors, helping the latter get into the markets even with a modest amount of funds under their belt. Brokerage houses also provide leverage, an essential tool for those traders who are pressed for time and go after immediate profits. Given that, global presence and a variety of licences held by a broker in various regions allows it to connect with more liquidity providers, which means more trades, higher liquidity, and, as a result, better quotes for individual investors. By accessing multiple regional financial markets, brokers gain the opportunity to offer more instruments to their customers by engaging with a wider variety of financial institutions. In its turn, a broader range of assets offers a more diversified investing landscape for traders, enabling them to customise their portfolios according to their long-term financial goals, opening capital, and investing style. To sum up, the wider the geographical reach, the better terms and a wider variety of tradable assets a broker can offer to its customers. 4. A wider range of features Reputable brokers use their global expertise to offer a variety of information resources to their clients, help them make smarter decisions, and improve their trading by introducing additional features to financial platforms. Geographical reach plays an important role in broker’s’ ability to provide supplementary tools and educational materials to traders, since each region serves as a testing ground and yields invaluable data. The interchanging of ideas and practices between different regions also plays the role of a catalyst to develop proprietary tools and courses. For global brokers, the process of making their clients’ trading experience smoother is a natural consequence of their wide reach and exposure to various mindsets and specific regional features. Conclusion Investing in the Forex market is a solid and comprehensible way to outpace the inflation and increase personal savings despite high inflation rates. People choose their Forex broker based on many factors, including their financial goals and personal preferences. Having said that, companies with global recognition and multiregional experience have an upper hand in comparison with others. International presence allows financial brokers to step up their security practices, improve user experience, and offer their clients better trading conditions. Octa is an international broker that has been providing online trading services worldwide since 2011. It offers commission-free access to financial markets and various services already utilised by clients from 180 countries who have opened more than 42 million trading accounts. Free educational webinars, articles, and analytical tools they provide help clients reach their investment goals. The company is involved in a comprehensive network of charitable and humanitarian initiatives, including the improvement of educational infrastructure and short-notice relief projects supporting local communities. Octa has also won more than 60 awards since its foundation, including the ‘Best FX Broker India 2022’ award and the ‘Most Reliable Broker Asia 2023’ award from World Finance and Global Forex Awards, respectively. #Elections2024"

    "title": "Know how Your ULIP Premium Gets Utilized",
    "published_date": "06 November 2020",

    "article_content": "Follow Us : In a world full of uncertainties, it is crucial to have a financial plan that secures your future. There are different investment avenues that one can choose depending on their goals to achieve the desired level of financial security. While you work towards that financial security and freedom, it is also of paramount importance to have a backup plan in case something unfortunate happens to you while you are still away from that goal. A life insurance plan acts as that plan-B which ensures that the future of your loved ones is not compromised even if something unfortunate happens to you. The importance of insurance is even more so in a world where we are coping with the deadly Coronavirus which has killed over one million people across the world. But what if there was a way to achieve both these objectives by following a single path -- where working on your plan-A automatically creates your contingency plan-B? This is where a Unit-Linked Insurance Plan, or simply called ULIP, comes in. But what is ULIP? A ULIP is a hybrid investment product that combines both investment and insurance needs of the investor. It is an efficient and long-term financial planning instrument. And on top of that, it also provides tax-benefits under different provisions of Income Tax Act, as amended from time to time. Dual Benefits of ULIP You can invest in a ULIP to secure your retirement years, for your children’s higher education and marriage, or to meet any other financial need expected to occur in the future. The insurance part in the ULIP provides life cover with death benefit. In case of the unfortunate demise of the policyholder during the policy term, the nominee will be paid the death benefit amount. In addition, if the policyholder survives the term of the ULIP, she/he can cash in for its maturity value. While investing, you can opt for an equity or debt fund exposure, or exposure to both. You have to specify the percentage of your corpus to be allocated to each of the funds you opt for. This constitutes the investment component of the ULIP. Depending on your risk profile, age and financial goals, you can decide your investment portfolio. For example, young investors may allocate a higher proportion to equity and a smaller proportion to debt fund. On the other hand, senior citizens can opt for a higher proportion of the corpus to debt fund. Investing in ULIPs helps you imbibe the habit of regular saving as the specified amount needs to be invested at regular intervals. They offer a fund switch option - the option to move money between equity, and debt funds. Premium allocation When you invest in a ULIP plan, the premium invested offers the policy holder dual benefits of investing either in equity fund or debt fund (or both), while ensuring a life insurance coverage as well so that your loved ones are protected. The total corpus you invest is divided into ‘units’ with a specific face value. Each investor is allocated ‘units’ in proportion to the amount invested. The value of each unit is known as the net asset value (NAV). The NAV tracks the performance of the fund. It reflects any increase or decrease in the value of the underlying assets. In case you withdraw some part of the corpus in the investment, in the middle of the tenure of the policy, a corresponding number of units will be sold for payment of the partial withdrawal proceeds. After maturity, payment may also be spread over a specific number of instalments if you choose such an option and if the same is available under the product. In case of the demise of the investor within the policy tenure, the death benefit will be payable to the nominee. Efficient long-term instrument ULIPs are suitable for investors who need a long-term insurance plan that offers the combined benefit of market linked returns as well as life insurance in a single policy. Equity helps generate high-growth potential returns over the long term, based on the market conditions. The debt component offers stronger protection to your corpus against market fluctuations. You may choose a ULIP investment according to your goals and risk appetite. ULIPs offer you the option for a partial withdrawal after a certain period. Also, there may be a top-up option, enabling you to invest more money in your plan. Tax benefits ULIPs also offer you a tax benefit. Investments in ULIPs are eligible for deduction against taxable income under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act 1961, subject to provisions stated therein. You can deduct a total amount of Rs 1.50 lakh per annum under this Section. The maturity proceeds of a ULIP are also exempt from tax under Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act, subject to provisions stated therein. In case of demise of a ULIP investor during the term of the plan, the death benefit paid to the nominee is exempt from tax under Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Charges levied on investor While investing in a ULIP, you should also be aware of the charges involved. Some of these include: Premium allocation charge: This is a percentage of the premium you pay. Hence, premium allocation charge is deducted and the remaining amount is invested. Fund management charge: This charge is levied as a percentage of the value of assets and will be appropriated by adjusting the NAV of the fund. The rate levied will be equal to the annual rate divided by 365 and multiplied by the number of days that have elapsed since the previous unit valuation. Policy administration charge: This charge is levied as a charge for servicing your policy. Mortality charges: It is levied for providing risk cover during the policy term Switch charge: This is a charge for switching from one option to another, over and above the number of free switches allowed. Partial withdrawal charge: It is levied in case a partial withdrawal is made during the policy tenure. Different funds levy all or most of these charges. You need to understand the terms and conditions of the ULIP and the various charges levied while investing. These charges are significant as they have an impact on the total returns from the policy that you invest in. If you are confused about how much premium you would require to create a corpus big enough to achieve your financial goals, you can use the ULIP calculator from Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance to get an idea before deciding on a plan. Bajaj Allianz Life Goal Assure# A Unit-linked Non-Participating Life Insurance Plan, a ULIP plan by Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance offer return of the entire mortality charges or life cover charges$ deducted during the policy term at the time of maturity You can also opt for maturity benefits in instalments^ . This plan offers a choice between eight different funds and four investment portfolio strategies. Hence, these features combined may result in optimum or desirable returns on investment for the policyholder over the investment period provided they stay invested. Because of the multi-dimensional benefits that ULIPs offer, you must consider adding them to your investment portfolio to strike a balance between your insurance and investment needs. It could serve as a one-stop solution for your family’s financial security and your long-term financial goals with the added tax benefits on investment as well as maturity serving as a cherry on the top.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Bangalore, February 18, 2024: According to a recent ICMR-INDIAB study, the number of people living with diabetes has increased by 44% between 2019 and 2023, to over 101 million.[i] While managing a chronic condition like diabetes can be challenging, people can take a holistic approach to keep their glucose levels in check by modifying their lifestyle, exercising regularly, eating well, and monitoring their glucose levels. Tracking one’s blood sugar levels informs personalized lifestyle and care decisions. This has been made simpler with technology advancements like continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Access to powerful data can help people optimize their glucose control and lower their risk of other health complications. Dr. Prashanth Subramanian, Head of Medical Affairs, Emerging Asia & India, Diabetes Care, Abbott says, “CGM helps people monitor their glucose levels real-time without hassles, complementing traditional blood glucose monitoring devices which require routine finger pricking. It shares valuable, actionable insights and is supported by a digital ecosystem that makes connecting with doctors and caregivers easy. The device also offers a unique metric, the time people spend in the target glucose range. Knowing this data can be life-changing and help people make smarter health decisions and gear for better glucose control.” Illustrating the device’s real-world impact, it has been found that when people with type 2 diabetes on insulin used CGM, it was associated with substantial reductions in acute diabetes events (by 51%) and hospitalizations (by 28%).[ii] With metrics like time in range (TIR), people can adjust their diet, activity, and treatment to better manage their diabetes, which in turn can help them avoid or manage other comorbid conditions. Every 10% drop in TIR greatly raises one’s risk of eye and kidney disease complications, while those with a TIR greater than 80% spend less time in ICUs.[iii] ,[iv] Prof. Ramzi Ajjan, Professor of Metabolic Medicine/Consultant in Diabetes and Endocrinology, University of Leeds and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said, “People with diabetes navigate not only fluctuating glucose levels, but also the risk of developing other comorbidities like heart disease, obesity, and eye problems. Diabetes and obesity often coexist, and together are associated with heart disease risk.[v] ,[vi] CGM can help people keep their glucose levels under control and avoid such risks. For example, people with type 2 diabetes who had experienced a recent heart attack and were using a CGM device report significantly lowered hypoglycemia levels as compared to those using traditional self-monitoring blood glucose.[vii] Avoiding hypoglycemia can help this high-risk population carry on with their everyday lives.” CGM can help those who may require surgery for their heart disease by optimizing their glucose levels before surgery. This potentially can improve their outcomes post-surgery. Such devices meaningfully improve people’s HbA1c levels, slightly increase the time they spent in the optimal glucose range, and enhance their quality of life. These benefits are important, especially as people with diabetes are two to four times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than others.[viii] Additionally, nearly 30% of people with type 2 diabetes had three or more comorbidities at diagnosis.[ix] Dr. Jothydev Kesavadev, Chairman, Jothydev’s Diabetes Research Centers, Trivandrum said, “In the state of Karnataka, there are around 10.6% people living with diabetes . It’s important for them to maintain glycemic control, which can be made simpler with tools like CGM that help them regularly check their glucose levels. This can help people understand how their food and lifestyle affect their blood sugar. People can accordingly alter their habits and even treatment appropriately, in consultation with their doctor. As a result, they can stay in the optimal glucose range for about 17 hours daily. These connected technologies, with their linked mobile apps, can extend healthcare beyond our clinics, reaching people in their homes.” While the diabetes journey can be difficult to navigate, technology is poised to be a game-changer for diabetes care, taking personalized healthcare a step forward so that people have less barriers to good health.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The government, private sector and citizens coming together in push towards sustainable development will power Bengaluru to its rightful place on the global map of developed cities, writes Ashish Puravankara, Managing Director, Puravankara Ltd Recently, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman praised Bengaluru, crediting the city for the buoyancy it provides to the country’s economy. Lauding the city’s start-ups, she said no other metro can compete with Bengaluru, which offers a diverse mix of start-ups in the agri-innovation, fin-tech, medical treatments, bio mix, AI sectors, and much more. From its heydays as a ‘Pensioners’ Paradise’, Bengaluru has undergone many transformations, pivoting gracefully from an aerospace hub to an information technology and start-up hub. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that the city has consistently reinvented itself to keep up with the times. Bengaluru has witnessed a boom in the past three decades as one of the country’s newest metro cities. The spurt in the volume of business activity in the city has spurred the government to ensure that the infrastructure continues to keep pace with the demands of a dynamic economy. The authorities are taking steps to ensure that the city’s development matches the needs and expectations of its residents - a multicultural populace comprising educated, global citizens. For over a decade now, the city has led from the front in activism, and the number of experts and organisations clamouring for change has grown steadily. This has also led the government to address crucial issues, steadily plugging the leakages in areas of concern. Take, for example, the water supply situation. In the year 2012-13, the Non-Revenue Water (NRW) percentage stood at 49 per cent. NRW is the difference in the amount of water the BWSSB receives against the amount reaching consumers. The NRW is caused by water leaking due to broken pipes, illegal connections and faulty meters. This means nearly half of all water pumped into the city was unaccounted for just a decade ago. By 2022, this was reduced to around 34 per cent, and work continues to achieve the target of 15 per cent by 2050 (according to the Vision Document 2050 by BWSSB). As the city’s population burgeons to reach over 1.25 crore in 2025, there is an urgent need to find another water source without being utterly dependent on the Cauvery - a fact with which the BBMP commissioner Tushar Girinath agrees. In the recent summit titled ‘Bengaluru 2040’, he stressed on the need for collective efforts focused on increasing the usage of treated water and more widespread residents’ adoption of rainwater harvesting methods. The government is already working to add transport and mobility options, like the Satellite Town Ring Road (STRR), to address the city’s infrastructure growth. This, along with adding land and infrastructure projects, is showing growth. Of course, this must be holistic and sustainable. According to Rakesh Singh, Additional Chief Secretary, Urban Development Department, an integrated city is being planned on the outskirts of Bengaluru, with around 10,000 acres earmarked for development in Bidadi. Positively, the government’s work can be more impactful and meaningful if the city is developed with a comprehensive development plan (CDP) which will factor in all-round growth. An updated master plan is crucial to regulating development. It is heartening to see the government pushing hard for a new CDP to be released as a roadmap for the next two decades of growth. A recent study showed that Bengaluru’s urban cover will increase to 1,323 sq km (by 58 per cent) by 2025, nearly double the spread of 727.88 sq km (31.75 per cent) recorded in 2017. The predicted urban cover for 2025 (1,323 sq km) is higher than the 1,314 sq km identified as a Local Planning Area (LPA), for which the BDA plans to introduce the new Master Plan 2041. This shows the need for holistic development. As developers, we can contribute to the city’s goals by building greener, better and sustainable buildings. The RICS Sustainability Report 2023 shows that globally, real estate developers remain focused on carbon measurement, a precursor to achieving net-zero carbon goals. Homebuyers in the United Kingdom, the Middle East and Europe are showing an increased inclination toward sustainable buildings, thereby providing a fillip for real estate developers. In India, we have also been witnessing such sustained interest, which augurs well for the future in Bengaluru and across the country. Bringing in a holistic development plan that balances commercial and public interests is the need of the hour. To grow as a city and claim its place on the list of global metropolises, many different branches of the government, the private sector and citizens need to work together to ensure sustainable development in the future. The sheer number of experts in the city discussing these issues and trying to find smarter solutions is a huge positive which ensures that the city is headed for better days. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : In 1974, M S Sathyu’s ‘Garm Hava’ painted a poignant picture of discrimination, deprivation and death through the slow disintegration of the Mirza family in Agra. Their sad plight mirrored that of Muslims in India in the aftermath of the Partition. However, despite professional setbacks, personal tragedies and even the suspicion of treason, the family’s patriarch, Balraj Sahni’s Salim Mirza, decides to stay back, joining his younger son, Farooq Shaikh’s Sikander, in a protest march against religious bigotry and unemployment. Half-a-century after the release of this scorching social drama, not much has changed for the 200 million Muslims who chose not to migrate to Pakistan. The 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, the abolition of Article 370 and the revocation of special status to Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, the inauguration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya in 2024 on the site of the Babri Masjid demolished in 1992, the threat of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) are just some of the reasons the bulldozed community continues to feel persecuted despite the secular nature of our Constitution. But few have left their homes and even fewer their homeland, choosing to fight for their rights through the ballot. In the second phase of the Lok Sabha elections, a sex scandal shocked Karnataka following the circulation of more than 3,000 video clips, photographs and documents of alleged sexual assault by Prajwal Revanna, J D (S) M P from Hassan. He has since been suspended. He was arrested by an all-woman team on his return from Germany where he had fled. His father and party leader, H D Revanna, was subsequently booked on charges of abducting their domestic worker who is seen being assaulted in one of the videos by his son. An FIR has been registered against the duo under Sections 354A (sexual harassment), 354D (stalking), 5O6 (criminal intimidation) and 509 (insult to modesty of woman) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Holenarasipura police station following accusations by alleged victims. What’s more, Prajwal has also been suspended by the party and has even lost his seat in the family stronghold. One wonders if this sex scandal, along with the one in the West Bengal village of Sandeshkhali which led to the suspension and arrest of TMC politician Shahjahan Sheikh and six others, is the beginning of a revolt against feudal patriarchy, gender oppression and power hierarchy? The kind we saw in ‘Ankur’ 50 years ago. Shyam Benegal’s first feature film as a director was reportedly based on true incidents and inspired by the Telangana peasant rising of the 1940s. It revolves around Ananth Nag’s Surya, who like his father, the village landlord, gets intimate with a poor, uneducated, lower caste woman who he hires to cook and clean for him. When his wife arrives, she throws out a pregnant Lakshmi — a National Award winning performance by Shabana Azmi — while Surya tries to persuade her to abort the child. Ironically, Lakshmi’s deaf-mute husband, Sadhu Meher’s Kishtayya, who had fled the village after being publicly humiliated for stealing toddy, is delighted she has got her wish of becoming a mother. He goes to a guilt-stricken Surya looking for work, but believing he has come to seek revenge for impregnating his wife, Kishtiyya is mercilessly lynched till Lakshmi rushes to his defense. Cursing her weak-willed and opportunist employer and lover, whose family has been exploiting the poor for years, she takes him home. But the incident has sown the first seedling of a rebellion against high-handed autocracy and the film ends with a little boy throwing a stone at Surya’s window and shattering the glass. Symbolic! The highest grossing film of 1974 was ‘Roti Kapada Aur Makaan’, with writer-producer-director Manoj Kumar as Bharat, a graduate, who, unable to find a job and support his family, burns his degree in his father’s funeral pyre and joins a corrupt businessman. According to the India Employment Report 2024 (ILO), India’s youth account for almost 83 per cent of the unemployed workforce and the share of youngsters with secondary or higher education in the total unemployed has almost doubled from 35.2 percent in 2000 to 65.7 percent in 2022. The parallels don’t end there. Manoj Kumar was reportedly inspired by Indira Gandhi with (the character) Bharat deciding to expose his employer, Madan Puri’s Nekiram, after listening to her Independence Day speech against hoarders. Thirty years later, her grandson and heir apparent, Rahul Gandhi, came up with his own magic formula to eradicate poverty. “If you are below the poverty line, then every year Rs 1 lakh khatakhat khatakhat aata rahega aur ek jhatke se hum Hindustan se garibi ko mita denge (will keep knocking into your accounts and in one stroke, poverty will be wiped out of India),” he promised women of poor households in the lead up to the Lok Sabha elections. Indira Gandhi’s ‘Garibi hatao’ brought her back to power in the 1971 elections. Rahul’s plans of a countrywide caste census and wealth survey couldn’t stop Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a BJP-led coalition government from returning to power for a third term, but it has resurrected the Congress’s fortunes and given the country a strong opposition again. Fifty years later, nothing much has changed. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : I have been playing the sarod for 37 years and I am still a student, learning something new every day. My journey with other stringed instruments is 12 years old. One day, in 2013 or thereabouts, I was grappling with the traditional instrument sursingar, trying to play an alaap in raga Darbari Kanada. The sursingar is known for its enormous size, and handling it is not easy as it has a string orientation different from other instruments. Noticing me struggling, my guruji Pranab Kumar Naha asked me to try a variant of the sursingar. It is relatively smaller and hence easier to play, but it called for some modification to suit my playing. That was the first time the idea of reviving and modernising an instrument occurred to me. And that is how my journey of reviving ancient musical instruments began. Most recently I have attempted to revive the age-old Tanseni rabab and sur-rabab. The Tanseni rabab was modified in the 18th century to make the sursingar, and the sur-rabab inspired the creation of the sarod in the 19th century. I belong to the Shahjehanpur–Bengal gharana of Hindustani music. In our parampara (tradition), we have four types of sursingars. I began training in 1987, when I was just four, under the late Pandit Naha, a senior disciple of the legendary Pandit Radhika Mohan Maitreya. I continued under him for 37 years, until his passing earlier this year. I also received training in rhythm from the tabla virtuoso Debasish Sarkar. I cannot tell the story of the revival of the Tanseni rabab and the sur-rabab, without first recounting how I brought the sursingar back from the brink. Long history In the 16th century, Mian Tansen developed a special rabab, modifying the Afghani rabab. The rabab he created was longer and bigger than the Afghani rabab. It was named Dhrupad rabab or Seni rabab. After Tansen’s death, it became widely known as the Tanseni rabab. Largely played in north India, the Tanseni rabab had a large hook at the back of its head, making it easier for a musician to sling it over the shoulder and play it even while walking. Nomadic musicians used it widely. However, the Tanseni rabab had a drawback. During the monsoon months, due to the moisture, the tension of the hide at the top of the sound box would give way, and this affected the quality of the sound. Tansen spent his life trying to rectify it, but couldn’t. In the late 18th century, Jaffar Khan, a descendant of Tansen, was performing on the Seni rabab at the royal court of Benaras in the presence of the Maharaja of Kashi. It was the end of June. The monsoon had just set in. The hide-covered sound box had absorbed the moisture in the air, and so had the strings, made from catgut. This resulted in a dull sound. Unable to perform well before the king, Khan asked for a few months to return and perform again in his presence. Khan got in touch with an instrument maker in Calcutta (now Kolkata) and developed a new instrument based on this Tanseni rabab. He added a metal plate to the surface, which became the fingerboard. He introduced metal strings in place of gut strings, replaced the small wooden resonator with a large gourd resonator similar to the one in the veena, and replaced the goat skin with wood. The replacements gave the sound a sharp clarity, which made it possible to execute long glissandos. This instrument came to be known as the sursingar in the Royal Court of Benaras. Filling the gap The sursingar has seen many modifications since Jaffar Khan’s time, and over the centuries. My experiments involved modifications to the size and shape of the instruments. I tweaked the materials too. There was limited access to certain materials back in the 18th century when the instrument was first made. Now there is an abundance of options, and I need to select them carefully for the ‘best’ sound. The reason I attempted to revive the sursingar was because I felt the sarod has some limitations; for example, it does not sustain notes for more than two or three seconds. As a musician regularly performing, I wanted to find a way to address this limitation. I looked at the instruments of my own gharana. The guitar and sitar are constantly renovated and updated. I thought why not try this with other Indian instruments. I am a first generation professional musician. Formal education came first: I completed my engineering and MBA and emerged one of the toppers. I had a corporate job as a marketing consultant for about 11 years. I used to head a team and was required to delegate work to my teammates. While waiting for them to finish their tasks, I did my music practice. This I did by keeping a spare sarod in the security guards’ room at my office. Whenever I had a few minutes to spare, I would pick it up and practise. This was how I managed to hold down a full-time job and still focus on my music. It took me about seven years to create the modern version of the sursingar. During the time, I also revived the Mohan veena created by my guru’s guru during 1943-48. This Mohan veena is a bridge between the sursingar and the sarod. It has the longer sustenance and resonance of the sursingar, the high speed playing capability of the sarod, and the tonal quality of the veena. It looks like a sarod as its fingerboard is a steel plate but the sound box resembles the minimised version of a sursingar. Thakur Jaidev Singh, the then chief producer of Akashvani, named this instrument Mohan veena in honour of Pandit Radhika Mohan Maitreya. This instrument was praised by several stalwarts, including Bharat Ratna Pandit Ravi Shankar, who wrote about it in his autobiography. I played this revived Mohan veena along with the sursingar at the G20 summit in New Delhi last year in the presence of ministers and world leaders. One of the challenges of designing the sursingar was ensuring that its sound should match up to the surbahar and sitar and even the Rudra veena. The sitar produces a sweet sound, the surbahar is known for its deep tone, and the sound of the new version of the sursingar had to be on par. I came up with three to four iterations before settling on the best. I followed the same procedure while reviving the sur-rabab and the Tanseni rabab. First, I had to understand the physical structure of these instruments and the sound they produced. My previous experiences gave me some insight. There are pictures of Tanseni rabab in old books. I also visited some museums to get a closer look. Then, I sketched possible new designs. My engineering degree came in handy. I looked at what wood, strings and materials to use. I had to compare them with what was used earlier, and find replacements for materials now banned or hard to find. I have a collection of eight sarods and each is made from different wood. I carefully analysed what kind of sound each wood produces. I settled on 100-year-old mahogany wood for the rababs. Older wood produces a sweeter sound, and the wood I chose was well seasoned and lightweight. This is also the reason older musical instruments are highly valued. Instrument maker Finally I sat with the craftsman, Shambhu, and prepared a blueprint. I met him sometime around 2014. I was desperately looking for an instrument maker and had checked out the work of craftsmen from across the country. None of them had seemed to fit the bill. One day, Shambhu showed up at my house. He said he had heard I was working on reviving rare instruments and he wanted to work with me. He lives in a remote village of West Bengal. He was originally a sitar and tanpura maker. I then visited his house and saw his work. He is a master craftsman. However, he needed my help with the final touches. After the designs were given to Shambhu, some months were spent on testing. The cutting and shaping had to be perfected, and we tested sample sounds with dummy instruments. I sought archival recordings of these instruments from the Sangeet Natak Akademi and Prasar Bharati. I kept certain things in mind. First, we are living in the 21st century, in the age of AI, electronic gadgets, superfine instruments and cutting edge sound equipment. It was important that the instrument was modern. I kept in mind what present-day audiences like. While conceptualising the modifications, I tried to understand why people would listen to Tanseni rabab, the sur rabab or the sursingar alongside the sarod. It was important not to deviate from tradition — I had to modernise the instruments while keeping tradition alive. Today, Shambhu makes 18 types of string instruments. He even exports sursingars to France and the US under my supervision. I don’t regret quitting my high-paying job and venturing full time into music and the preservation of our cultural heritage. Prime Minister Narendra Modi appreciated my work on ‘Mann Ki Baat’ in February, 2023. My work also got recognition from Padma Bhushan Pandit Arvind Parikh, the senior most classical musician of our country, who invited me to play at his south Mumbai residence. He is known to only invite senior renowned artistes to his baithaks. The Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva award from Sangeet Natak Akademi in Instrumental Music was also a big accolade in my life. Viewers and subscribers on my YouTube channel have grown in a big way in the last three years. I am getting invited to play on various stages across the country. I have no patents over the designs of the revived instruments, and I don’t plan to apply for any. Music should not be kept confined for personal profit. I am not the original inventor — I believe more people should start playing it. Only then I will feel that my work is a success. I have heard that some artistes are also getting sursingars crafted in Gujarat, Miraj and even Bengal, and practising the instrument indoors and on local stages. This resurgence was necessary. I wish them all the best. ‘Talim’ is important. One day I got a call from a foreigner. He had bought a sursingar similar to mine, but had no idea how to tune it, and needed my help. I told him he should have called me before ordering it. Fretless string instruments, like the sursingar and rabab, are not easy to play. Sursingar is especially not an instrument for a beginner. It is advisable to begin with the rabab or sarod and then move on to the sursingar. Other revivals I am not alone in making these contributions to ancient Indian instruments. My own gharana’s Somjit Dasgupta has been preserving 52 traditional instruments of Pandit Radhika Mohan Maitreya for the last 44 years. I got a chance to look at a 1911 sur-rabab from his collection. He is compiling all records, documents, letters and videos of the masters of our gharana. Subhasis Sabyasachi, a percussionist in Delhi, is working on the revival of age-old traditional percussion instruments like the shruti, awaz, and dunduvi, as also the 500-year-old mridang and brojatarang. Jyoti Chowdhuri of Maihar, Madhya Pradesh, is playing the nal-tarang of Baba Allauddin Khan. He had developed it from the barrel of the rejected guns of the Maharaja of Maihar during the late 19th century. A few years ago, Tharun Sekar revived the yazh — an ancient Tamil instrument. Though I personally haven’t met Sekar, I hope to meet him some day and do some work together. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : It was a hot summer day. The students of grade six were playing games on the sports field. They had a free class as their teacher Mrs Ruth Braganza’s hadn’t turned up. The guava, gooseberry and mango trees were in full bloom. The gardener plucked the ripe fruits dangling from the branches of these trees and handed it to them. The boisterous games the kids were playing had made the air hazy with dust. Dust coated the students’ shoes, clothes and hair. Hearing the lunch bell ring, the students exchanged smiles. All the games had made them super hungry. They all ran eagerly to their classroom, excited to see what their moms had packed in their lunch boxes. Their classroom was in the new block, on the ground floor. As they all neared it, they exchanged shocked looks. There were party sounds coming from their classroom. They heard music, laughter, and other loud sounds. They approached the door. Their eyes widened as they saw a big ‘Welcome to the Germ Party’ banner hanging at the entrance of their classroom. “We just left the classroom for an hour and now there is a party in it,” Rohan looked puzzled. “Listen to all the fun they are having,” Rasha said. “I’m so jealous that I wasn’t invited to this party.” “Our history teacher is right,” Yuvraj said. “None of you pay attention to anything in life. Nor do you all read properly.” “What do you mean?” Garima scowled. “Why would you all want to attend the Germ Party?” Yuvraj pointed to the banner at the entrance. The other students stared at it with wide eyes. They gulped as realisation dawned. “So, what shall we do?” Aditya asked. “We will silently watch what is happening?” Yuvraj said. He approached the door and peeped in. Turning around he beckoned the others. They all thronged the door of the classroom. Small creatures with spikes protruding from their body were jumping on chairs and desks. Some were dancing in the aisles, singing at the top of their voices. “It’s time to party,” said a green germ. “As Garima never washes her hands before eating, I’m waiting to enter her stomach and have fun.” “What will you do?” another monster asked. “I’ll enter Garima’s stomach through her dirty hands and give her a stomach ache,” the germ replied. “If I’m in a bad mood, I’ll give her a nasty stomach infection.” Garima started crying. “I’m super excited to roam inside Rohan’s body,” said a big germ. It was the germ of laziness. “He is cooped up in his room all the time, playing on his laptop. Good health comes with exercising the body which Rohan seldom does. I’m going to have fun giving him all kinds of health problems.” “Yes,” the other germs screamed. Rohan looked worried and touched his stomach. He hated exercise and was always munching on fast food. The germs had started playing passing the parcel. Suddenly one germ said, “Guess what I’m going to do for lunch today?” “Have fun in Aditya’s stomach,” his friend replied. “Yes,” the germ grinned. “I have been sitting on the guava he has been holding for a long time. We all know that Aditya has a bad habit of not washing any fruit he eats. He just sees a fruit and starts gobbling it up like he hasn’t eaten from years.” “Yes,” replied another germ. “Don’t these children know that there are all kinds of germs in fruits and vegetables lying open in the market. Don’t these children know that insects crawl over the fruits and vegetables? Aren’t they aware of the number of flies swarming over them? Don’t they see that their vegetables and fruit are handled by so many people? Yet, these children are in such a hurry to eat them that they just put them into their mouth.” The children all stared at the germs in shock. Exchanging worried looks they clutched their stomach. “No wonder I always get a stomach bug when I eat unwashed fruit,” Rani said. “We are going for a picnic,” said a group of germs. They flew to the door handle and started dancing over it. “Do you all know where is our picnic today?” The other germs looked surprised. “Where are you folks going?” asked a tall germ. “We are going to Ronit’s throat and nose,” the germ replied. Ronit looked worried. “Ronit touches all the surfaces, desks, door handles, walls, and windows. He doesn’t bother washing his hands before eating. He does this day in and day out,” the germ grinned. “We will enjoy an outing in his nose and throat today. You will see him with a runny nose and a sore throat today. He will be sneezing constantly soon.” “Ronit, go wash your hands,” Yuvraj whispered. Turning to his classmates, Yuvraj said. “Friends we can’t allow the germs to make us fall sick. It’s important to play outside and get some Vitamin D. Exercise is good for health and playing with friends is a good stress buster. It’s equally important to follow basic hygiene, like washing our hands before eating and washing our hands after playing or touching objects. Eating fruits and vegetables is good for health, but we should always wash the fruit and vegetables well. If we are smart, the germs will never have a party in their lives.” The children rushed to the restroom and washed their hands. They also washed their mangoes, guavas and gooseberries as well. When they returned to the classroom, they were surprised to see the room all quiet. Most of the germs had fallen to the ground and were now lying on their back as though they had all fainted. “See the germs,” Yuvraj pointed. “We defeated them by following basic hygiene. This should actually become our daily practice. Once we all do this, it will be the end of most of the germs.” “Yes,” the other students replied. “Bye, bye germs.” #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Yes: I completely agree that books are better than television, because books provide valuable knowledge which one may need in the future. I believe that many people would agree with me, especially youngsters. Some may argue that not all books, like storybooks, provide knowledge. But I do not think that way. In my opinion, if a book provides a piece of information that you weren’t aware of, it helps boosts your general knowledge and helps you develop your thinking. Personally, I find joy in reading more than anything else. Storybooks are my favourite as they possess the power to transport you to different worlds. Just give them a try. Many people find history boring. It actually isn’t. Not when you get to live in the shoes of historical figures. It’s a lovely experience. Such books help mould one’s character, teaching important morals and values. Legendary authors like Ruskin Bond, Sudha Murty, Enid Blyton, R K Narayan, and Shakespeare have truly taught me important life lessons and helped me transform into a better citizen. Vignesh S, 13 Bengaluru, Karnataka No: Television is one of the most popular devices. It is used to share information all over the world. It is the most common form of technology used today, for multiple purposes. Having a television at home not only provides entertainment to the members of the family, but also becomes a source of information. It’s a medium that is easily accessible. Due to this, TV channels have viewership running into millions. Many believe that televisions are merely a distraction for children. But I don’t believe that is true. Television provides knowledge about various topics like news and sports. I thoroughly enjoy watching television with my friends and family. It brings us all together. Together we get to learn so many things — from cooking to current affairs. It also helps you learn multiple languages. I’m sure the same applies to many other people. It’s my favourite way to relax on the weekends. Plus, television can also be used by visually challenged and speech impaired individuals. Overall, it is a more entertaining medium and that is why I prefer television over books. Chandana, 14 Doddaballapura, Karnataka #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : I have been collecting cars since 1978. However my love for wheels goes back much further. When I was 14 and living in Mysore, my grandfather gifted me my first scooter, a Lambretta. It was a little bulky to ride around in. Three months later, he upgraded me to a 125cc Honda motorbike. And soon, I was fondly known around the city as ‘The Honda Kid’. My father worked as an engineer-in-chief and later a PWD special secretary. He would frequently travel across the state on work. It was through him that I got interested in cars. He had an Austin, and later, an Ambassador. In 1974 or thereabouts I drove down to Coimbatore in my father’s Ambassador to get bucket seats fitted. I removed its petrol engine, and installed a diesel one in its place. These days, you can barely tell the difference between a petrol and diesel engine. Diesel engines back then were not smooth, and the car would vibrate noisily, but I wanted to get more mileage. I am now a cardiothoracic surgeon. When I was studying to be a doctor at St John’s Medical College in Bangalore, I lived in a hostel there. My father would come visiting and leave his car with me. He had a German friend who had brought his Mercedes with him to India. He would also leave his car under my care on his visits. So, at a young age, I had an opportunity to drive and experience these cars. This is what sparked my interest. I used to get the cars serviced at Webb’s Garage on M G Road. Once, while waiting for the Mercedes to be serviced, I got chatting with a fellow customer. He was also getting his Mercedes serviced. At the end of the meeting, we shook hands. He handed me a stack of books and asked me to read them. It turned out he was Puttaparthi Sai Baba. One of his disciples had gifted him the car. Even after his assistant, Srinivas, told me his name, I had no idea who he was. That was in 1976. I still have the books he gave me. They are all signed by him. I was no collector then, nor was I dreaming of becoming one. The author at his garage which houses cars dating back to 1909. DH PHOTO/ PUSHKAR V Mountbatten car In 1978, I drove down from Bangalore to Madras in my father’s Ambassador to watch the Sholavaram races. The unused World War II airstrip had been turned into a race track. The first two weeks of February were when the motorcycle and car races were held. My friend and I were driving back when we passed the most beautiful car I had ever seen. It was a silver 1937 Sunbeam Talbot. My friend told me that the car was up for sale. He had seen an advertisement in a Tamil newspaper. We stopped the car, bought the newspaper and found the number to contact. Next, we went to a phone booth and I made the call. The owner lived in Red Hills, near Ambur. We drove there and were welcomed by a woman called Kamala. She was the wife of the owner, a retired army general. We sat down with him. He served us beer and snacks and proceeded to give us a bit of history about the car. Its first owner was Lord Mountbatten, the viceroy and first Governor General of independent India. There are pictures of Mountbatten with Jawaharlal Nehru and their wives seated in the car while in Shimla. The general was the second owner. On wobbly knees I had one beer. My friend had a few more. By then the general had had a few bottles. He looked quite wobbly. As we sipped our drinks, I asked him what the price of the car was. He said Rs 40,000. It would have been over Rs 1 crore by today’s standards. There was no way I could afford it. I had been saving up to buy a Mercedes from one Ganesh Rao for Rs 8,000. So I decided to let go of the Mountbatten car dream. We said our goodbyes and drove back to Chennai. Later that day, I called Kamala to thank her for her hospitality. She said the general had slipped down the stairs and fractured his leg. He had been taken to Command Hospital, about 30 km away. Kamala was getting ready to take him some food. She had to travel by bus as she didn’t drive and they did not have a driver. I drove to the hospital. He was all strapped up, and Kamala had arrived by then. I wanted to help her out, so I left my car with her. My friend found a driver to drive her between her home and the hospital until her husband was discharged. I got my car back after 10 days. In November the same year I received a telegram from Kamala. The general had died. Kamala said, “Come and collect your car.” She meant the Sunbeam. I had not agreed to buy it, but I felt I had to. I collected money from about half a dozen friends. When I reached her house a few days later, I handed over the money to her. She refused to take it. She said the general had willed the car to me. So, instead I bought her a VCR and a 21-inch TV, considered big in those days. And I drove the car from Madras to Bangalore. That is how I started my collection. The Sunbeam was also the first vintage car my wife drove. She went on to have a ladies’ team in the rallies, with my two girls in this very car. It has a very special place in my family. Wheels in a bag The Mountbatten car did not need any restoration. It was in great condition. But the same couldn’t be said of all the cars that came my way. I had an Anglo-Indian mechanic called Beaty. He lived in Richmond Town in Bangalore at the time. He helped me with a lot of my restoration work. But I had to find someone more permanent, and slowly I set up a full team. The team was headed by my main mechanic, Paul D’souza, tinker Ramakrishna, carpenter Legge and upholsterer Sarwar. All of them have passed, except for Ramakrishna, whom I am still in touch with. One of the first cars we restored was a 1915 Model T Ford. It was in bits and pieces and brought to us in nine gunny bags. Some parts had to be imported. It took us a year-and-a-half to rebuild it. There was no Internet in those days, so we had to write letters to friends and acquaintances to learn about the parts and how they had to be put together. During that time I made a lot of pen friends, all car enthusiasts who helped me gain insights into the cars I was fixing. Over the years I acquired a Mercedes 320, Motilal Nehru’s 1928 Lanchester St 8, a 1929 Mercedes Nurburg, and then a Delage. Some of the others are a 1909 Wolseley that belonged to the Maharani of Cooch Behar, a Studebaker Commander that was owned by Kuvempu, and Maharani of Travancore’s 1933 Sunbeam. They are parked in my garages, located on my farm in Bengaluru. The property also houses my workshop, office, residence and an organic farm run by my wife. How we do it I picked up most of my vintage cars when they were in a shambles. Some took three-four months to rebuild, others took years. Today, with the Internet, it has become easier to find parts. When we pick up a car, we pick it up with our heart more than our head. We begin by researching and learning more about the model. Then we examine the condition of the car — what is there, what is missing, what needs replacing, what is rusted. Then we start looking at manuals and catalogues. Before the advent of the Internet, we would take photocopies of manuals that belonged to other collectors in Bangalore. I still remember the smell of ammonia from the photocopy machine. We would then take all the measurements, rebuild the engine and then put the rest of the car back together slowly. There was a business called Vijayalakshmi Chrome Plates near Coles Park where we would go to get the chroming done. It was a time-consuming, labour-intensive process, but I enjoyed every minute of it. Making our own parts Thanks to the Internet, if we get the dimensions and other details, we can even make a few of the parts at our own facility. We have a lathe machine, so we manufacture a lot of the small parts in-house. Today, in modern cars, tinkering is rare. If a door is damaged, it is replaced. In vintage cars, you fix the broken door — you can’t get a new one. We are currently in the process of restoring a Buick that belonged to J R D Tata. All vehicles manufactured before 1994 (30 years and above) are known as historic. Earlier, vehicles manufactured from 1886 to 1904 were called veteran, 1905 to 1918 Edwardian, 1919 to 1939 vintage and 1940 to 1979 classic. Restoration is a tedious and expensive process. Finding labour with a knowledge of the craft is not easy. Time, effort, patience, and heart and soul go into bringing these automotive wonders back to life. I now have a younger team of 12 workers. It has taken me a lot of time and monitoring to assemble a good team. The workshop is managed by Shankar. He was my electrician and then became my friend. He has been with me for 45 years. My daughter Rupali oversees all the operations. She is equally passionate about cars. Karnataka, I would say, has roughly 1,000 historic vehicles. Across India, that number probably stands at 25,000. Usually, collectors have one car or one bike that belonged to their grandfather or has been in the family for generations. They are heirlooms and the owners have an emotional connection with these vehicles. The number of collectors is also increasing. A lot of young people are showing interest in preserving and acquiring old vehicles. Policy worry The government’s scrappage policy, which mandates the scrapping of vehicles over 15 years old, needs to be amended. I set up the Federation of Historic Vehicles of India in 2017. We had been in talks with the previous government about changing the policy. Now, I will have to renew those talks with the new government. I am confident we will reach a consensus. If old vehicles are scrapped, we are in danger of losing our automotive history. The Maruti 800 has become a collectible. I can see Tata Indica joining that list. So you see, it is important to save this history and preserve it for the generations to come. (As told to Rashmi Rajagopal) #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The ajrakh block print from Gujarat is known for its timeless elegance and skilled artistry. It is back in the limelight as it earned a Geographical Indication (GI) tag in May. Ajrakh is a complex block printing technique that uses natural dyes and layered prints. The name possibly came from the Sanskrit word ‘ajharat’, meaning does not fade, or ‘azraq’, the Arabic word for blue. Versatility factor The beauty of ajrakh lies in its unisex appeal, says Mohammad Sahil Khatri from Ajrakhpur, Bhuj. “At gatherings in Kutch, you will see women wearing ajrakh salwar kameez and sari, and men sporting ajrakh-printed shawls or turbans,” he elaborates. Steeped in our cultural heritage, ajrakh’s intricate patterns go well with both fashion and décor products. Savitha Narayanan, architect and co-founder of The Dwell Theory, based in Milan and Bengaluru, says, “We’ve used ajrakh-printed cotton for making napkins, scarves, and pocket squares.” Evolving motifs Ajrakh prints mostly feature geometrical and floral motifs. “Each motif symbolises an aspect of nature,” says Tausif Khatri, owner of Ajrakh Dreamation, located in Dhamadka village in Bhuj. In recent times, he has been incorporating contemporary patterns like zigzag lines, hexagons, and triangles. These designs are popular in running fabrics meant for stitching kurtas and skirts. Sahil specialises in traditional designs like ‘kan kharek’ (dried dates) and ‘riyal’ (circular pattern that symbolise coins). However, in the past three years, Jaipuri designs like ‘phooljhadi’ (bunch of flowers), ‘jharokha’ (a typical Rajasthani stone window projecting from the wall face of a building), peacocks, and queens sitting on elephants have gained popularity, he points out. Backstory Khengar Bhai, whose ancestors hailed from Sindh in Pakistan, sheds some light on the history of ajrakh tradition. Ajrakh prints were widely used by Sindhi Muslim communities living along the Indus River in pre-partition India. It remains popular even today in Sindh (Pakistan) and Kutch (Gujarat). He shows me an indigo-maroon ajrakh-printed bedspread at his handicraft shop in Dhordo village, Kutch. He says, “In Sindh, ajrakh is synonymous with exquisitely designed, brilliantly dyed, and skillfully printed clothes.” And in Kutch, the herding community favours ajrakh turbans for their softness, lightness, and vibrant prints. “The prints help them identify their family members in the fields,” he shares. Tausif’s village Dhamadka is located in Bhuj, a major town in Kutch. The village has a century-old legacy in ajrakh block printing. “Traditionally, ajrakh was crafted by men, mainly from the Khatri community. They would use resist dyeing (method) with natural colours,” he says. Dhamadka was the centre of ajrakh block printing as it was located on the banks of the Saran river. However, the trade suffered a setback after the river dried up in the early 1990s. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake hit another blow, forcing ajrakh artists to move 40 km away. They then established the Ajrakhpur village, which has now emerged as the hub of Kutch ajrakh block prints. Tool watch The raw materials used for Kutch ajrakh block printing include fabrics, natural dyes, mordant gums (substance used to bind dyes on fabrics), and water. Tausif says that ajrakh designs can be printed on cotton or silk. “We source 360-count cotton sheets from Erode, Tamil Nadu. From Chanderi or Surat, we get modal silk, a wood pulp-based cellulose fibre (made from beech trees). The use of cotton is more popular,” he adds. Teakwood is carved with motifs required for printing. Previously, artists drew designs on paper, transferred them onto wooden blocks, and carved the motifs. “Nowadays, many artists purchase (pre-carved) blocks from skilled carpenters in Pethapur, Gandhinagar,” Tausif says. Carving intricate motifs on wood is an art in itself. “Three to six blocks are needed to create a motif, and each is dyed with a different colour,” he explains. Making process Ajrakh printing involves 12 to 14 stages, depending on the motifs one wants to achieve. “Mordants, resists or both are used in the printing,” says Sahil, a 24-year-old artist and proprietor of Ajrakh Print Official in Ajrakhpur. His family has been in this trade for three generations. If a fabric carries ajrakh prints on one side, it is called ‘ekpuri’ and if a fabric has prints on both sides, then it is ‘bipuri’. To begin with, a white cotton fabric is washed to remove starch. It is then soaked in a solution of castor oil, soda ash, and camel dung overnight, and dried in the sun later. “This is repeated seven to nine times until foam starts to appear when the cloth is rubbed in water. Once this is achieved, it is washed in plain water,” Sahil details. ‘Kasanu’ is the next step. Here, the fabric is dyed in a cold solution of myrobalan, derived from the powdered nut of the harade tree. This turns the cloth yellow and also acts as a mordant to hold the dyes. After dyeing and calendering (smoothening the fabric), it is laid flat to dry under the sun. ‘Rekh’, the third step, is a crucial one. This is when you draw the outline of the design on the fabric. “A resist made of lime and gum arabic is pasted onto the cloth to define the outline. For double-printed fabrics like the ‘bipuri’, this step is repeated on the reverse side of the cloth,” Sahil explains. Colour theory The subsequent steps involve dyeing the fabric with different colours, drying, washing, and repeating the cycle until the entire design is completed. “The dyes must be prepared just before the process so they are easy to apply,” he says. ‘Neela’ (blue) is made from the indigo plant, ‘laal’ (red) by boiling tamarind seed powder with alum, and black by soaking rusted iron, jaggery, and gram flour and then cooking the mix with tamarind seeds. ‘Leelo’ (green) is derived by dipping indigo-dyed fabric in a pomegranate and turmeric solution, ‘peelo’ (yellow) is made from turmeric, and a ‘bhuro’ (brown) shade is obtained by dying a fabric with a rhubarb extract. Blue, black, red, and white were traditional colours used in the prints. “These colours symbolised various aspects of the universe — red for earth, black for darkness, white for clouds, and blue for the universe. Today, ajrakh prints also feature green, yellow, and brown,” says Bhai. It is important to allow each dye to dry completely before proceeding to finish the ‘ekpuri’. “In the case of ‘bipuri’, the fabric is dyed on one side, dried halfway, and taken back to the workshop to dye the other side before allowing it to dry again,” Sahil elaborates. To prepare the background colour, primary dyes such as blue or red are mixed in the water and boiled. Different parts of the fabric are immersed in different boiling coloured water and then left to dry. How to spot a handmade ajrakh fabric Machine-made ajrakh fabrics are widely available now and make use of synthetic colours, says Mohammad Sahil Khatri. “To spot a genuine hand painted ajrakh print, look for imperfect designs like smudged colours or patterns that are slightly off. Also, pay attention to the colours. Synthetic colours are bright while natural dyes are more muted,” he adds. In ‘ekpuri’ ajrakh fabric, the pattern shows through the non-dyed side whereas the back side of a machine-done fabric will be plain, he explains. Tips to maintain With proper care, you can retain the colour of ajrakh-printed textiles for at least 10 years. “Wash them in cold water. Avoid soaking. Dry them in warm yet shaded areas. Refrain from using harsh chemicals or perfumes on them,\" advises Savitha Narayanan. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Choosing a side table for a room can be a daunting task. Not only does it have to be functional, versatile even, but also blend with the decor of the room. Kishore K V, an interior design consultant from Mumbai, lists some questions you should ask yourself before getting one. Do you have a clear idea of why you need a side table? Are you purchasing one to hold drinks, keys or TV remote, to keep a table lamp, or for the looks? Would you like additional storage space? Experts share more pointers. Size up A side table should be as high as an armchair or sofa in your room. A shorter table will do but not higher. While you don’t want to buy a huge side table, it should at least be 18 inches wide. “Anything smaller will not be functional. And if you want to place a bedside lamp on it, a 22-inch-wide side table will be ideal,” says Radhika Susheel, an interior designer from Kochi. Function factor “If you have a small room, get a side table with additional storage or one that can turn into a drinks-and-snack table for gatherings,” says Chennai-based design consultant Shraddha Chitran. You can serve drinks on tables with ceramic, stone and glass tops without worrying about scratches. You won’t need coasters; just wipe them clean. While going for a multi-purpose table, choose one with an open shelf to hold books and other night-time essentials like a sleep mask, ear plugs and night cream, suggests Kishore. Complimentary decor In terms of looks, Radhika says that round and oval tables go well with most furniture. “They look great in a room that has boxy pieces like rectangular sofas, chairs and coffee tables,” she says. If you have children or pets, she suggests going with a table with rounded edges or a circular table. “Square or rectangular side tables give a more formal look to a room,” she adds. If your room has a lot of upholstered furniture pieces, sleek and simple side tables work best. If your room is furnished with modern pieces, you can choose something ornate. In contemporary settings, some people prefer a slightly taller side table. “This helps to highlight plants or showpieces kept on top of them,” says Kishore. Radhika says while marble and stone tops look sophisticated, wooden tables emit a warm look and metal or glass side tables exude a contemporary style. Go experimental If a side table is not the centrepiece of a room, Kishore says you can experiment a lot. “Choose ones in bright yellow or pastel shades, or tables with curvy or oddly shaped legs,” he offers. But don’t get carried away, he advises. Avoid placing a big side table near a sofa with big and bold patterns – it can make the room look stuffy and overwhelming. Don’t add too many side tables in a room. Keep one next to a sofa or a chair, or one between a pair of chairs. “If you want to limit the number of side tables in a room, go for a coffee table instead,” says Shraddha. Mix and match It’s fine to have a pair of identical side tables in a room. But if you are planning on more than two side tables, then don’t try to match them all. “The tables should largely belong to the same look or theme though. For example, all the tables could be made with either teak wood or bamboo. Or they can have common accents done in either gold or copper. A common feature will give the room a cohesive look,” Shraddha adds. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : A Kannada film based on the lives of migrants from northeast India living in Bengaluru is slated for release next week. Titled ‘Chilli Chicken’, the film directed by Prateek Prajosh is a story of five boys who work as waiters in an Indo- Chinese restaurant in Bengaluru. The restaurant is owned by a local Kannadiga named Adarsh, played by Shrunga B V. “An unexpected event sets things in motion,” Prateek says about a turning point in the film. In summary, the film dwells on how these boys navigate through their lives away from home and how they deal with circumstances that make them feel like outsiders in their own country. In a conversation with Showtime, the director talks about the real-life incident that inspired the film, working with actors hailing from strife-torn Manipur, and the relevance of the film. Edited excerpts: Why did you want to tell a story about people from the northeast working in Bengaluru? When we visit cafés or restaurants in the city, there are (high) chances that you will encounter a person from the northeast or Nepal. We see them so often around us but don’t know anything about them. All we know is that they look a certain way. I feel there’s a lack of empathy towards the community. We wanted to address this through the film. It’s important to tell the story of migrants. The film is loosely based on a true incident that happened in Frazer Town in 2014 where a hotel staff from the northeast died. The story was brought to my attention by Siddhanth Sundar (also the music director of the film) and it has stayed with me since. We developed the story during the Covid-19 pandemic. Tell us about your research in portraying a true picture of their lives. We spoke to a lot of people who work as waiters and servers, and even students and people with corporate jobs. We understood what the general grievances were. We brought them to the fore. Chinese food is very popular here (Bengaluru). Most of the boys from the northeast work in these restaurants for the simple reason that they look ‘Chinese’ or ‘Oriental’. It makes these restaurants look authentic. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the discrimination against them skyrocketed. The virus was from China but these young boys and girls were called ‘Corona’. That’s when I thought it was important to address this issue (the discrimination meted out to them). Why is the film called ‘Chilli Chicken’? Chilli chicken is an Indo-Chinese dish. Apart from that, it’s a racial slur. People from the northeast are also called ‘momo’, ‘chinky’ and ‘chowmein’. People think it’s a casual joke but we never fully understand how they feel. The idea was to create an awareness (among viewers) to be conscious of the terms they use in front of people of northeast origin. What challenges did you face while making the film? The challenge at the scripting stage was the amount of research we had to do. I was particular about telling the story in a sensitive manner — both from a Kannadiga as well as a northeast person’s point of view. It took us a while to collect stories for the film. Another challenge came during the production. Two of our main actors are from Manipur. And Manipur has been burning for the longest time. There came a situation when we were not sure if these actors would be able to make it to the shoot on time. The trickiest part was that these five boys from Manipur and other north eastern states had never spoken a word of Kannada in their lives. They had to come down, learn the language, and dub their lines. Any interesting incidents from the shoot? When we were shooting, a bunch of kids thought we were shooting with the popular K-Pop band, BTS. It’s coming from an innocent place but you see how ignorance can stem from anything. I wanted to tell them that this is not a K-drama and that the actors are from India, from the northeast. But the actors didn’t want to let these kids down. So they pretended to be members of the K- Pop band. The kids took many pictures with them. This gave me an idea for a hashtag for social media (promotions) - #nammaKdrama. It’s not a Korean drama but a Kannada drama. It’s crazy how ideas come from the most unexpected places. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Asli or naqli? Ramoji Rao was asked this question by an intern during a workshop at Ramoji Film City. The aim of the workshop was to teach print journalists the nuances of TV journalism. Rao was planning to expand the ETV channel network, airing in only Telugu back then, to five more languages. He was hosting an intensive workshop for journalists he had handpicked from various parts of the country. Journalists visiting Ramoji Film City, spread across 2,000 acres, stood confused and astonished, unable to distinguish between what was real and what was fake. A temple where they offered prayers in the morning would vanish by evening. Through the gates of a jail, they would find themselves entering a school. A church became a mosque at the back and a temple from the side. Everything was so intriguingly designed that they were baffled. Rao arrived to address the journalists, accompanied by a security team armed with AK-47 rifles. He encouraged the journalists to ask questions. The first came from a girl who pointed to the AK-47 rifles: “Are they real or fake?” Rao burst into laughter and replied, “Our journalism, ethics, and social service are real, but many things you see in Film City are not.” Passion for movies Rao’s 87-year life journey was anchored on this principle. He infused a social responsibility dimension into his films, TV shows, and newspapers. This is how Rao, who hailed from Krishna district in Andhra Pradesh, became renowned across the country and even secured a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. His journey won him one of India’s highest civilian awards, the Padma Vibhushan. As a young boy who used to watch two movies a week, Rao went on to create Ramoji Film City, where two films could be made every week. From the time he watched movies to the time he oversaw Film City operations, sitting in a nine-story office there, his life was filled with many dreams. When I entered his office as the head of the ETV news division, I knew I would take back with me a wealth of stories every time I met him.Once, he said, “Do you know I am also a film star?” If you search for Ramoji Film City on Google, you will find everything about me, but you won’t find that I have acted in films,” he said, chuckling. That was just two years after he had started the film magazine Sitara. I had close contact with him for nearly a decade. Rao could identify a need, and meet it, and this was the secret behind his success. Whether in cinema, television, politics, or hoteliering, this was his strategy — filling the gaps. Within a few years of starting Sitara, he set up awards for cinema. He was also the first to focus on those who remained in the shadows in the film industry, and give them due recognition. He loved watching films and reading books. He merged these passions and emerged victorious on the big screen. A less-known aspect of his life was that he ran magazines, Chatura and Vipula, for literature enthusiasts. A story published in Chatura, ‘Prema Lekha’, was adapted into a film. Thus, Rao’s cinematic dream began with ‘Srivariki Premalekha’ (1984), and from there, he never looked back. Refreshing change Amid films with eight murders and 18 fight sequences, a gentle breeze of love stories emerged. Rao’s films also told real-life stories of survival. Beginning with hits such as ‘Kanchanaganga’ (1984), ‘Mayuri’ (1984), and ‘Pratighatana’ (1985), his production house Usha Kiran Movies went on to produce 87 films in multiple languages. Rao understood that ensuring films reached the audience was as important as making films. This led to the establishment of the Mayuri Distribution Company. To popularise songs from his films, he started a cassette company with the same name, and for promotion, he had the daily Eenadu. He conquered one milestone after another. A significant milestone in this journey was Ramoji Film City. Universe in a city Ramoji Film City, established in 1996, became a preferred destination for shooting films and TV serials in all Indian languages. It was said that one could walk into it with a script and walk out with a film. Its exceptional capabilities attracted the attention of even Hollywood, making it a location for many big productions. One day, Rao asked me if I could arrange for an elephant. I was stunned. A film required nine elephants, and they had managed to secure only eight. The ninth was proving elusive. While I was still processing this request, he told me a circus company had set up camp in Shivamogga. He suggested that I speak with them to see if they could lend us an elephant for four days. This was how Rao always succeeded in his ventures. He conducted exhaustive research and knew every member of his staff across the country. He was also aware of the tiniest details from every corner of the nation. My friends and I would often joke, “God created the universe and the universe waited for Rao to create a film city.” Before I joined Ramoji Film City as the head of ETV News, the poet Jayant Kaikini had given me a piece of advice: “Never post any letters there; otherwise...” It was only after I arrived there that I realised all the post boxes were part of film sets. Train with tyres Once, while wandering around, I saw a train appear on the road, seemingly out of nowhere. The train had truck tyres. It could halt anywhere and the actors could sing duets on it! When I joined ETV, Rajamouli was directing the serial ‘Santhi Nivasam’ for ETV Telugu. Years later, the sets of ‘Baahubali’ attracted crowds. Recently, I saw fans flocking to the sets of ‘RRR’. Those who have trained under Rao have become eminent figures in cinema and TV today — directors, actors, musicians, singers, and more. Too many to count. Once, I asked Rao why he hadn’t written an autobiography. Without missing a beat, he brought out a book from his private room. He started flipping through its pages. It was filled with stories of people who had beaten difficult odds to climb every step in life. “Society needs autobiographies of such individuals,” he said. “The lives of those who have fought for a dignified existence should not be left undocumented.” Rao often said, “Make a mistake, no matter how big. Make another mistake, but I will never let you make the same mistake twice.” As he leaves at 87, amid a trail of monumental achievements, I can’t but hope that his departure is ‘naqli’ news. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Six months ago, I got a call and a deep voice said, “Am I speaking to Rumi Harish?” I knew who it was. I dropped the phone in excitement, and then quickly picked it up. The voice said, “I am Rajeev Taranath”. I stammered, “Sir, sir, yes, I know.” Years ago, he had asked me to perform for the Taranath Foundation. He had said I had his mother’s name Sumati, and he felt good to see me chatting and singing. But this time, he did not utter a word about my dead name, or his mother’s name. He was so sensitive about my transition. As a student of Pandit Ramarao Naik, I had sung in his presence since my childhood days. He was a phenomenon, known for his intensity and deep knowledge of the ragas. This time, he started talking about how he was impressed with ‘Jaunpuri Khayaal’, a book written by Dadapeer Jyman about my life. He congratulated the two of us.I suspected he had not recognised who I was, and mentioned my dead name to tell him who I was. He paused, and said that he did not want to hurt my sentiments by talking about that name. It was like a moment where my taan (fast phrases) went off track and got reined back in. I couldn’t have asked for a better acceptance; many of my own people have not acknowledged my changed being. Not once did he bulldoze me with platitudes, as the elderly often do. He chatted happily about Mysuru, where he lived, music, and a bunch of other things. One day, he called and said, “Hello Rumi, I want to ask you something, but I don’t want you to misunderstand me.” Immediately, I thought I knew where it was going and cursed all cis men for their curiosity about the anatomy of my manhood. I steeled myself to talk about my gender surgery. What came from him was totally unexpected. He said, “So, you have done gender transition, but have you done voice transition?” I blabbered an incoherent answer. “Wait, are you on testosterone? Has your singing voice broken?” His questions soothed me. This act of compassion is extremely rare. In his teen years, his voice had broken and he had not been able to sing. He asked me what I was doing. I began explaining everything that I had gone through to sing after my transition. He said, “Listen, come to me, I will help you out. Don’t keep waiting for your voice to get better… If I could start learning the sarod at 51, you can now sing with the voice you have.” I had approached many musicians seeking help to sing through this transition. They had avoided me because of my identity or were clueless about how to train me in this phase. This had pushed me into despair. But that call brought back my guru Ramarao to me. Disillusioned by classical music circles and the people in it (with a few exceptions) I had stopped attending concerts; I had even stopped listening to music. I felt guilty--I had followed my heart to be what I was today, but had not asked my voice what it wanted. I could not sing for a year and a half. My voice was broken and sounded like a bark. I was not sure whether I wanted my singing flexibility back or the voice of my previous gender. While I continued to live with a shaky voice, I did everything possible to bring back my singing. I succeeded to an extent and was able to get some stability in my voice. From February this year till June 11, when Taranath died, I was transported to a different world altogether. When I went to see him in Mysuru, he said, “You have not lost your singing. Why worry, just sing. Everything will fall into its place. Mind you, I will be a tough teacher.” He laughed like a baby, and his eyes said a lot more. He kept singing all the time I was there. He just wouldn’t stop, from raga to raga, thumri to dadra, he sang and made me sing too. That’s when I realised that riyaz (music practice) is not something we do for a few hours. It is a way of life — you are immersed in thoughts of music, and you take off on the wings of your thoughts. Lalit is a raga with a complicated scale. My first class began with him singing Lalit. I was repeating what he sang, and he stopped me. He said, “Don’t parrot me. That is to learn the notes, and you have already done that. Follow my thoughts, see the journey of my thoughts, allow me to see your thoughts and challenge me. The most beautiful part of music is the movement you create and the density of the notes you construct in the abstract. Yet, you have to see it, see the line of movement, see how you construct a thought.” I sighed, trying to grasp the thought, and he sang more complex ragas related to Lalit. I was trailing. This experience reminded me of Aditi Upadhya (one of my teachers and daughter of the illustrious singer and composer Pandit Dinkar Kaikini). She leads, and helps students construct thoughts in music to make it into a poem or verse. Finding the keynote Given my situation in life, I could not go to Mysore as frequently as I wished. I requested him to reduce the frequency of my classes. That did not go down well with him. But within two days, he called me back and insisted that I take more frequent, online classes. He was undeterred and had taken up the challenge of training me. “Keep seeking your sa (the first note). Seek till you are a beggar before the note, till you breathe your last,” was his advice. When I went to see him, a day before he breathed his last, I stood looking at him in the ICU, knowing that all of us students would soon face a void. I came out numb. One of his friends, in the waiting room, said: “Rajeev gave me your book and shared the story of how you tried to learn from musicians who turned you down. He said it is a mistake if we don’t teach people from diverse identities. Who are we to stop the river of music? He said if he didn’t teach Rumi, he would be betraying our history of music”. I was overwhelmed. Taranath is a phenomenon that touched many lives, but for him to take me into his fold, breaking all conservative dogmas, is to practise the politics of love. It does not discriminate, and it gives us the dignity and confidence to live. I won’t say thank you Rajeev. I now have a mission in my life — seeking my sa — and that is a tribute that I will pay for a lifetime. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Buoyant, upbeat, optimistic, confident – choose any word, and it would aptly describe the mood in I.N.D.I.A after the bitterly fought Lok Sabha elections. The alliance may not have enough seats to usurp power but some of its members now want to unseat the Narendra Modi government, which they believe is on the crutches in its third term. Others in the alliance insist on caution though. The adrenaline rush is understandable, but the big question staring the Opposition in the face is whether the competing interests of the partners would allow it to stay together for the next five years. Questions are bound to rise as the bloc will face Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, Haryana, and Maharashtra by early next year, and some prominent allies are all set to break ranks to fight against each other. They say that the alliance was only for the Lok Sabha elections. Despite being aware of these future divisions, people did vote for the bloc. But the question remains whether they will accept it in the future. In Delhi, the AAP will not cede space to the Congress in the Assembly polls slated for early 2025. Similarly, the Congress has made it clear that it does not need an ally in Haryana to win the state polls to be held later this year. In the just-concluded general elections, the Congress and AAP were allies in these two states. The Lok Sabha polls itself revealed cracks in Jammu and Kashmir, which is expected to see Assembly polls by September 30. It is to be seen whether PDP will be accommodated by the bloc in the Assembly polls though the National Conference refused to cede a seat to PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti. Maharashtra is where the I.N.D.I.A bloc is unlikely to see much trouble, but seat-sharing negotiations are all set to be tricky with a resurgent Congress, which won 13 seats – the most among the MVA allies – itching to make claims for more Assembly seats. This is likely to upset the Shiv Sena (UBT) more than the NCP. Congress has already flexed its muscles with state chief Nana Patole demanding more seats though the party’s central leadership has asked him to tone down. The poll outcome has resulted in churning in the extended NCP and Shiv Sena families amid murmurs of the MLAs linked to Ajit Pawar and Eknath Shinde getting in touch with Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray. If the poll-bound states have troubles, the bloc also has national dilemmas. Aspirations and impatience mark the mood in the alliance after Congress, Trinamool Congress and Samajwadi Party performed well cornering the BJP in their areas of strength. Though Congress has improved its numbers in direct contests against the BJP, it is yet to achieve a critical mass that could bring it closer to the orbit of power. Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, and Himachal Pradesh had not returned a single Congress MP in 2024 and if it hopes to defeat BJP in the future, it will need victories in these states as well as improve its standing in Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. West Bengal will be another state that will be under intense scrutiny. Will Left and Congress continue to remain allies, or will the latter move to the Trinamool Congress camp? A senior TMC leader said, “If Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury had not insisted on more than two seats, the alliance would have worked, and the BJP would have been reduced to six seats.” As the undeclared leader of the bloc, it is also to be seen whether the Congress would continue to be accommodative like it was in Lok Sabha seat sharing. It contested for 328 seats, the least it has in its electoral history. It would have to take forward the consensus approach with a demanding ally like the TMC and a stronger Samajwadi Party, which improved its numbers from five in 2019 to 37 this time to emerge the third largest party in Parliament. The TMC has already upped the ante, saying it “won’t be a photocopy of someone else’s strategy” and wants a speedy attack on the Modi government. “We are not waiting in the lobby. Our driving style is more aggressive. Maybe some are not used to it,” a TMC leader said after the post-results meeting of the bloc. With the Opposition hoping for the collapse of the NDA government owing to its inherent contradictions, one of the challenges for I.N.D.I.A would be how to counter Narendra Modi creating a situation where he lays all the blame for instability at the doors of BJP’s allies in the NDA and the Opposition and himself opts for midterm polls to turn the tide in his favour again. The question is whether the I.N.D.I.A bloc has enough wherewithal to afford a midterm election. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The annual Amarnath Yatra, set to begin on June 29 this year, is a deeply revered pilgrimage for millions of Hindus, with historical and social significance. This journey to the abode of Lord Shiva in the south Kashmir Himalayas is steeped in ancient lore, with the cave's naturally occurring ice lingam symbolizing the Guardian of the Absolute and dating back thousands of years. Legend has it that Lord Shiva revealed the secret of immortality (Amar Katha) to Parvathi in the cave, situated at 3,888 meters above sea level. Though it was mentioned in Puranas, the local folklore has a Muslim shepherd Buta Malik ‘re-discovering’ it. A Sufi saint gave Malik a bag of coal, which turned into a bag of gold coins. He went out again to look for the saint but instead discovered the cave shrine with the ice lingam. The Yatra, in an organised form, began in 1934 under Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh. It was halted during the partition in 1947 but resumed in 1949 with the intervention of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India's first home minister. The pilgrims travel 46 km from Pahalgam or 14 km from Baltal base camps to reach the cave, navigating steep, winding mountain trails by foot or riding on ponies, pithus, or palkis. Terror threats to Yatra The annual pilgrimage is a big challenge for the security forces as it attracts hundreds of thousands of devotees to a historically volatile region, especially in light of potential terror threats. After the Lok Sabha elections, which saw a good turnout, successfully holding the Yatra this year would demonstrate that the administrative machinery in Jammu and Kashmir is well-prepared and capable of handling the logistical and security challenges for the assembly polls in the Union Territory. On June 16, Union Home Minister Amit Shah chaired a high-level meeting to assess the security situation in J&K and the preparations for the upcoming Yatra. In response to recent terror incidents in the Jammu region, the Centre has deployed over 500 companies of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to ensure that the Yatra proceeds smoothly. Senior officials from the army, police, CRPF, and BSF have held several meetings to review the security situation for the upcoming Yatra. J&K police chief R R Swain acknowledged the ongoing threats, stating that enemy forces aim to disturb the peace. However, he assured that the security forces are taking all intelligence seriously and working tirelessly to maintain security. “It (a successful yatra) would reflect improved security, political stability, administrative readiness, and public confidence, all of which are essential for holding free, fair, and credible elections,” said a senior official. The Yatra has faced numerous terror threats in the past. In 1994, Pakistan-based Harkat-ul-Ansar banned the pilgrimage to protest the demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. Despite threats, the Yatra continued even during peak militancy years. However, in 2000, the terrorists killed 25 people, including 17 pilgrims, at the Pahalgam base camp. More such attacks occurred over the next two years, but major incidents ceased after 2002. The Yatra has persisted despite unrest in Kashmir, such as the 2008 protests over land transfers to the Shrine Board. In 2017, a terror attack on a pilgrim bus killed seven people. Between 1990 and 2017, 53 pilgrims were killed, and 167 were injured in 36 attacks on the Yatra. Environmental concerns Environmental challenges also necessitate regulating the Yatra. In 2022, flash floods at a base camp near the cave shrine killed over a dozen pilgrims and injured several others. The construction of a road to the cave shrine last year sparked controversy, with some Kashmiri Pandits and opposition parties warning of ecological catastrophe. Sanjay Sapru, a social activist, emphasized the need to balance the sanctity of the Yatra with environmental preservation. “There has to be balance. Simply increasing the number of pilgrims each year should not be the sole indicator of its success,” he told DH. He said the Yatra symbolizes true Kashmiriyat as continuous support of Kashmiri Muslims has always been crucial for ensuring the seamless conduct of the religious pilgrimage, regardless of the circumstances in the Valley. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The annual pilgrimage to the Amarnath Holy Cave shrine in south Kashmir manifests both religious devotion and communal harmony. This Yatra attracts hundreds of thousands of Hindu pilgrims from across India. The local Muslims facilitate the Yatris, be it with their hospitality or by providing ponies, pithus (rucksacks), and palkis (palanquins) to help them reach the abode of Lord Shiva. The local Muslim community plays a crucial role in ensuring the pilgrims' safety and comfort, demonstrating a spirit of unity that transcends religious boundaries “We see the pilgrims as our guests,” says Ghulam Ahmed Dar, who has been providing palanquin services to the Yatris for over a decade. “In our culture, guests are considered a blessing, and we do everything in our power to ensure they have a safe and comfortable journey.” Afaq Wani, who offers transport services to the pilgrims, echoes this sentiment. “Our religion, Islam, teaches us to be kind to everyone regardless of colour, caste, creed, or religion. In the Quran, Allah says: ‘Help one another in acts of piety and righteousness,’” he explains. Wani participates annually in a special prayer for the Yatra in the Mattan area of Anantnag district. The logistical support provided by local Muslims is deeply appreciated by Hindu devotees, who often express their gratitude for the warm hospitality. Ramesh Kumar, a devotee from Punjab, shares his experience: “The warmth and support we receive from the local Muslim community are overwhelming. They go out of their way to help us, often in very challenging conditions. This Yatra would not be possible without their dedication and kindness.” Meena, another pilgrim, recalls an instance when a Muslim family helped her when she fell sick on the trek. “Their care and concern were no less than what I would have received from my own family. This is the real spirit of India, where humanity rises above religious differences,” she says. In Kashmir, often portrayed as a strife-torn region, the Yatra stands as a symbol of unity and mutual respect. It weaves a tapestry of harmony, in defiance of the terrorists. “This Yatra is a microcosm of what India truly is,” says Shabir Ahmad, a volunteer managing a community kitchen during the Yatra. “People of different faiths coming together sends a powerful message of peace and unity,” he adds. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : It was Rashmi’s turn to answer Mrs Narsappa’s question: “Who is the one person in the world you idolise?” Before her, Mithun predictably had said, “Kohli”. Manju before him had said Neeraj Chopra… Gopi hadn’t listened too carefully to everybody’s answers, but he’d sat up when Vijay of all people had said Greta Thunberg. He hadn’t expected Vijay to be interested in environmental awareness. That made him pay attention to everyone’s answers…he didn’t want anybody to mention HIS idol’s name before he got a chance to answer Mrs Narsappa’s question. He needn’t have worried. Most students in Rows 1, 2 and 3, were film fans. So names like Hrithik Roshan cropped up a lot. Mary Kom, Deepika Padukone, Sania Mirza and P V Sindhu were favourites among many girls. When he stood up to answer, Gopi puffed up his chest and said, “Ma’am… my hero is Anand Sir… Anand Malligavad!” In the silence that followed, Gopi realised nobody had even heard of his idol. Vijay’s bored, “Who’s thaaat?” pretty much summed up the class’ reaction. But Mrs N was intrigued and said, “That’s interesting Gopi! Tell us more about your idol. The class hasn’t heard about him.” Gopi hadn’t realised how much he knew about Anand Sir, because the words tumbled out of his mouth at top speed. “Ma’am, he’s saved over 30 lakes in Bengaluru in the past 6 -7 years.” Grumpy Shwetha mumbled, “How come I haven’t heard about him, then?” Gopi snapped, “You’ll only hear about him if you listen, right? So let me tell you about him. He is a mechanical engineer who worked for an auto components company, but taught himself a whole lot about lake revival, water conservation and bio-diversity in his free time. Then he went on to revive a dead lake of over 30 acres — it had been dry for over 35 years, and in just 45 days, he and a team of volunteers, brought the lake back to life.” “How come you know so much about this?” Manju asked Gopi, from the bench behind him. “That’s because my grandparents live beside that very lake — the first one Anand Sir revived. Kyalasanahalli Lake. I can now swim there, it’s so clean. There’s 30 acres of water just walking distance from my Ajji’s garden.” Mithun teased him, “So reviving that one lake made him your idol?” Gopi, fiercely proud of all of Anand Malligavad’s many accomplishments, snapped back, “ No… I did mention he’s revived 35 lakes in Bengaluru alone. Between 2017 and 2020 itself he revived nine lakes. Each success led to more lakes restored. Now the UP and Odisha governments have invited him to train locals in lake revival.” Turning to Mrs Narsappa for help, Gopi went on, “Ma’am, he studied the water conservation practices of the Chola kings who ruled parts of the Deccan region over 1,500 years ago. They’d set up a network of lakes, interlinked by canals to not only ensure wide areas of land had water to irrigate crops, but to also prevent flooding during heavy rains.” The mention of ‘flooding’ caught the class’ attention. Many of them lived in areas of Bengluru that often flooded during the rains — ruining homes and cars, and leading to many of them shifting houses. Mrs Narsappa had a nose for homework opportunities. And in Gopi’s impassioned speech on Bangalore’s lake man, she’d spotted a golden chance! “Okay class, Gopi has given me an idea…” The class groaned, many of them shooting Gopi angry looks for ‘giving Mrs N ideas’ that would only mean extra work for all of them. Mrs N continued, “I want each of you to pick a lake Anand Malligavad has restored and write about it. You will all get a week to submit your reports.” Manju stood up, “Ma’am, I want to write about my hero —Neeraj Chopra… can I?” Mrs N replied coolly, “Sure son, you can write about him ALSO!” The class groaned. Ma’am continued, “Remember, you all anyway have to submit a Social Studies project by next month, so water conservation would be a great theme… Gopi, do you know about any other lakes your Anand Sir has revived?” The normally shy Gopi shot up and began reeling off names, “Yes Ma’am — Maragondanahalli Lake, Chikkathoguru Lake… the worst was Konasandra Lake which was more toxic than even Bellandur lake with all its chemical foam that caught fire… totally the 3 lakes Anand Sir has revived covers 800 acres and holds 106 million gallons of waters, cooling the surrounding areas, and raising the underground water table by 8 feet!” “There you go…” Mrs Narsappa snapped her fingers. “I’ll put up the list of lakes on the board tomorrow and all of you can decide who works on each.” Then, turning to Gopi, she asked, “Do you think your grandparents can organise a class visit to the Kyalasanahalli Lake beside their house?” That got the class excited. Gopi jumped up, “Yes Ma’am, maybe Thatha can even invite Anand Sir to explain all that he did to revive a dead lake and we can all swim there too!” On the way home, Gopi heaved a sigh of relief — if his over-enthusiasm had only led to more homework for his classmates, they’d have grumbled at him for weeks! But since he would now be responsible for a class trip, with swimming included, everyone had forgotten about the homework and were eagerly planning for the ‘picnic by the lake!’ #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : It’s a little past noon on June 15. I hop out of an underground metro train in Delhi to get into another. My next train plies above. The air conditioning is ineffective. The train stops every few minutes, blasting a gush of hot air on our faces each time. There are 25 stops to get to my destination. I alight and hail an autorickshaw. The ride feels like somebody has a hair dryer positioned on me. To distract myself, I put on ‘Kabir Bhajans’ by Kumar Gandharva and plug in my earphones. An hour and a half later, I arrive in a low-income colony in North East Delhi’s Sundar Nagri. Located 25 km from the Parliament, Sundar Nagri was once the handloom citadel of Delhi. Now residents are involved in selling vegetables, working in factories, making bindi, rakhi and toys and, very few, into weaving. I am reminded that Kabir Das was also a weaver. According to the India Meteorological Department, Delhi-NCR is about a week away from monsoon and I am here to understand how the killer heatwaves affected these residents. World over, the climate crisis hits the poor disproportionately. A conversation with my ‘cook aunty’ got me thinking about this. “Last year, a student was selling a small room cooler for Rs 800. I was not carrying so much money that day and I also forgot to borrow from you. The next day, the cooler was gone. I never came across a cooler so cheap,” she told me. She regrets not having a cooler this year. So every day, she sits a good five minutes in front of the cooler in my flat, before getting on with the kitchen work. Her words brought into focus the inequality, the disparity between the haves and have-nots. I come from a lower-middle-class family in Madhya Pradesh. Between my brother and I, we earn modestly. I am a freelance writer. I work remotely. I have a choice to stay indoors, steadfastly next to my cooler. That choice is a privilege, I fully know. Buying more ice I have a water bottle and some ORS packets in my backpack but I seem to have forgotten to pack my cap. So using my bag as a sunshield, I start walking towards the colony. Street sellers are getting ready for the Saturday market ‘Sani haat’. Some are arranging clothes, spices and utensils in neat rows on slatted platforms. Some are tying yellow and blue tarpaulin sheets overhead. Some are taking water breaks. It is 2 pm. Close to where the market ends, I meet Bhagwati Devi. The 60-year-old sells a variety of things — fryums, cold drinks, cigarettes and pan masala. Squinting her eyes, she examines the sparse crowds passing by. Her face lights up when a woman stops by to get fryums for her kid. Two weeks ago, she was bedridden because of heat stroke and diarrhoea. “I am old. I can’t take this heat but I have to come back to work,” she tells me in Hindi. According to a report, the demand for ice creams, dairy beverages and curd rose over 40 per cent this summer. So Bhagwati’s cold drinks must be selling quite fast, I think out loud. She lets out a sigh and says, “People are not stepping out much. I may be selling 2-3 more cold drinks per day than last summer.” A recent survey of 700 street vendors in Delhi by Greenpeace highlights the slump. Titled ‘Heatwave Havoc: Investigating the Impact on Street Vendors’, it found that 49.27 per cent of respondents experienced a loss of income during heatwaves, with 80.08 per cent of them acknowledging a decline in customer numbers. Growing expenditure is Bhagwati’s bigger worry. “I am spending Rs 50-Rs 60 more daily to keep my stock cold. Lately, the ice is melting in 12 hours.” Nonetheless, she is glad to have an ice box. “I don’t have a refrigerator at home. My family keeps water bottles in the ice box and enjoys chilled water,” she shares coyly. She moved to Delhi from Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, four decades ago. Neither had such extreme weather back in the day, she reminisces. “Earlier, in Aligarh, we knew there would be nine very hot days and then rain would come. Now, who can predict?” she asks me. I nod, thank her for her time, and head for the colony. I am staring at a narrow alley in front of me. Only one person can use it at a time, either on foot or cycle. In places, hutments, all ‘pakka’, are leaning or stacked on each other, like a collage out of a scrapbook. I am looking for Meenakshi, a homemaker. A kid guides me: “Go straight and knock on the house that has two ‘charpai’ (woven bed) outside.” I set off. I turn back and see that five to six kids are following me like ants in a line. Cooler stories Meenakshi lives in a joint family. It’s a two-floor house, with one room on each level. Her room on the first floor is the most sought-after because it has a cooler. Meenakshi, her husband, her children and her brother-in-law’s children — eight of them — sleep in the 10x10 space. There is no legroom to sprawl but their cooler and a refrigerator they bought last year make up for the discomfort, she says. We sit under the fan in the ground floor room, where her father-in-law lives. I ask the colony kids when they will go and play. The summer vacation is on. “Mummy doesn’t let me go outside in this heat,” says one boy, 6. His sister, 9, reveals the backstory: “Bhaiya, his nose starts bleeding. It’s so hot this time. Even my father is not going out in the afternoon to sell vegetables.” Meenakshi pitches in, “Last week, my son went to a shop to buy toffee around 5.30 pm and his nose started bleeding. Imagine! When I was growing up, we would go out to play after 4 pm or 5 pm.” Meenakshi has been using the cooler non-stop since April, switching it off only to fill the water or when she has to cook. “I can’t keep the fan and cooler on while cooking. The room is small, so the flame on my gas burner keeps going out. I have to wake up at 5 am and finish the cooking and other chores by 8 am, before the room heats up,” she explains. She says unlike other parts of Delhi that are reeling under water shortage and power outage, their colony has no such issues. “Only one day, there was no water supply,” she adds. Her father-in-law stays at home like her. He is struggling with sleep. On most nights, he shifts restlessly on his bed. He only has a humble, noisy ceiling fan in his room. Come morning, he opens the door with hopes of letting in cool air. All day, he moves between the ‘charpai’ outside and his bed inside trying to catch some sleep. Our conversation returns to the cooler. My extended family lives in Parichha, a village once known for jaggery. I spent many summers there. We had a cooler, which we rarely used. Our family used to cover the roof of the house with wood and leaves (making a ‘chappar’) and that was enough. In my home in the town of Shivpuri, prepping a cooler was a family ritual. During winters, we would stow the cooler under a cover that my mother would make from her old sari. And when summer approached, we would clean it with surf and water, change the cooling pads, oil the motor, check the water tank and then install it outside the window on a stand. Meenakshi is itching to tell a story. She says, “When my brother was born, my mama (mother’s brother) gifted us a cooler. We were living in a different slum in Delhi. We were the first family to have a cooler. Every time we installed the cooler at the start of summer, kids in the slum would come to our house to see it. Everyone wanted to be our friend.” Fond memories give way to harsh realities as Meenakshi says, “Because of health concerns, my husband doesn’t want me to go back to making and selling bindis. But I feel I should. We are using the cooler all the time. Electricity and water bills have gone up.” Her husband makes parts for water tanks in a factory. It’s around 3.30 pm. My shirt is clinging to my body. Beads of sweat have erupted on my forehead. The foul smell of the open drainage outside the house is making me nauseous. Toddler cries I meander through the alley, walking past brick-exposed homes, hoping to strike up a conversation with other residents. I see a woman making rakhis for the festival of Raksha Bandhan, coming up in August. She introduces herself as Shabnam. Her house is cramped. It belongs to her sister. She is living here to save on the rent. However, she pays rent to use the washroom upstairs — it belongs to her neighbour. I can see a table fan and a 'matka’ (clay water pot) from the door. “My father gave me a cooler as part of my dowry. But since I have no space for it here, I left it in Bareilly (where she shifted from last year),” Shabnam says while disentangling the rakhi threads. “My husband and I have got used to the heat. I also wash my face and feet for respite from time to time. But I want to have a cooler for my toddler. I feel bad when he cries,” she says, her eyes welling up. She gets up and picks up her toddler. She takes him to the whirring table fan and then wipes his face with water. She takes up seasonal jobs like making rakhis and her husband toils in a factory. Despite the dual income, rising expenses are pinching the family of four. “Our income has not increased but my older kid keeps asking for ice cream and cold drinks. How can we deny them this summer?” she asks. She is also buying more milk. “I don’t have a fridge. It’s a struggle to prevent the milk from curdling. If a guest visits, we get a new packet. In my parent’s place, we would save the milk by placing it in the tank of our cooler,” she shares. The survey cited earlier says household expenses of street vendors shot up by Rs 4,896.52 on average during extreme heat months. Children’s demands for soft drinks and heightened healthcare costs had increased the financial strain, half the vendors said. The report also underscored the physical burden — 73.44 per cent experienced irritability while 66.93 per cent suffered from headaches, 67.46 per cent from dehydration, 60.82 per cent from fatigue and 57.37 per cent from muscle cramps. Shabnam and my conversation peters out, a sign that I must move on. ‘Nothing changes for us’ On my way out of the colony, back to the ‘Sani haat’, I meet a couple — Sunita and Jagdish Pal. They are selling vegetables. Jagdish isn’t pleased with the story I am working on. “You (journalists) come, make your story, and nothing changes for us,” he says. I get his cynicism. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority drafted a Heat Action Plan last year but it is not yet notified. For vulnerable populations, it calls for setting up shaded areas and water points, providing ORS packets, organising medical camps, and shifting schedules for outdoor workers. Over a call later, Greenpeace India’s senior campaigner Avinash Chanchal tells me that street vendors spend 16.2 years of their lives as street vendors on average. Yet, not many were consulted for the heat action plan. Emphasising that extreme heat widens the socio-economic gap, he says, “Money that could be spent on recreational activities for their kids is being spent on things needed for survival.” It’s past 4.30 pm. Walking towards the metro, I am gripped with thoughts. What was the summer of 2024 like for me, especially since May when the mercury has stayed above 40°C consistently? I skipped my evening runs or walks. I cut down weekend visits to plays or comedy gigs. I hung out in places that had air conditioning. A mid-day outing to a second-hand book bazaar left me with a high fever. I stocked my fridge to capacity because I did not want to run to the grocery store for last-minute milk, mangoes or ‘dhaniya’. I am more irritable and less productive because I am struggling to fall asleep — 4 am is the new 11 pm for me. Before hopping back on the metro, I stop by a sugarcane juice stall at the end of the ‘haat’. An old man is sitting in front of a cooler, enjoying his little oasis. Sipping my juice, I tell him, “Too much heat.” He replies with a smile, “Barish se aur haalat kharab hogi, umas badh jayegi (Rain will make it worse; humidity will increase).” His comment takes me back to what Bhagwati had told me about “the fate” of vulnerable populations. She said, “Not just the summer, the weather in Delhi is becoming extreme year after year. Wait for July. The monsoon will hit and these ‘naalis’ (drains) will start overflowing with sewage, stinking up the place. You won’t be able to stand here. Winters are becoming harsh too. Who can control nature? You have to learn to live with it.” Like this story? Email: dhonsat@deccanherald.co.in #Elections2024"

Sunny, turmeric, mango, marigold… the many tones of yellow have ruled forever. Butter yellow is at the top of the colour palette this season, sneaking its way into suave and subtle dressing. Why the colour? Kolkata-based fashion designer Pallavi Singhee, and founder of Verb, says: “Butter yellow is a great colour for the season. Yellow is a mood booster, reminding us of sunshine and positivity. It is a no-brainer even when it rains, as it is refreshing and easy on the eyes.” The muted butter yellow is a good option between the otherwise boring beige and eye-popping lemon yellow. Its soft pastel appeal is what is making it a wardrobe favourite. Goa-based Ruchika Agrawal, head of design of No Nasties, explains, “The colour reminds of the sun, blooming flowers and bright days, which make it a complete mood lifter. Also, the colour complements Indian skin tones,” shares Rikita Saluja, the creative mind behind cloth designs from The Dramebaaz Co, Kolkata. Indian context “Sorbet hues like butter yellow suit Indian skin tones, and go well with summer-friendly fabrics like organic cotton,” says Ruchika. Jaipur-based fashion designer Surbhi Rawat, founder of Studio Surbhi, states that butter yellow is a cool pick as it brings together the warmth and brightness of the season, while maintaining a sense of sophistication. Butter yellow is a muted yet statement colour. “This is why we have created designs in butter yellow inspired by traditional Rajasthani drapes.” Pallavi believes in celebrating the sunny vibe of the colour by contrasting it with other colours. “While working with prints, I’ve used butter yellow with other tonal pastels (like chalky yellows and ivory), and contrasting colours to create a sense of depth and variety,” she explains. Its versatility makes the hue blend well with denim — a staple in every wardrobe — as well as with off-whites and creams, she adds. Butter yellow with brighter yellows might dilute its subtle elegance and result in a chaotic ensemble. One needs to be careful while picking the colours to create a cohesive look, cautions Surbhi. Rikita concurs and adds that one needs to curate different shades of yellow well to put together a dynamic look. “One can pair a butter yellow top with mustard pants and create a harmonious, gradient effect. You can also experiment with more subtle yellow hints like a pale yellow scarf or bright yellow shoes,” she says. The monochromatic look of a solid butter yellow ensemble can make you look taller. Varied palette The colour embraces all silhouettes — from jumpsuits to shorts. “Its soft tone works as a neutral base, allowing it to be paired with bold, printed skirts for a day out, or a sleek blazer perfect for a night outing. Dress it up with metallic accessories for a glamorous look or pair it up with a part of jeans for an everyday ensemble,” says Rikita. Co-ords and shorts are perfect for a casual laid-back look. “If you want a corp-core vibe, style a butter yellow blazer with white shirt and pants. Skirts or dresses are ideal for a night look,” she adds. Tone on tone (using different shades of the same colour) is a style statement, according to Ruchika, who has used the colour in an azul gold kaftan in feather-light organic muslin. Pallavi has designed skirts, jackets, and off-shoulder tops to celebrate the colour’s charm. “Jackets in the colour paired with denim make for a chic and casual look, while skirts and off-shoulder tops in the hue look fresh,” she explains, recollecting her childhood memories of sunny days. “Embellishments and prints used in the ensembles are designed to complement the softness of the colour,” adds Pallavi. Butter yellow is a universally flattering hue, as it works with every body type, age, skin tone, and gender. “Anyone who wears the colour will look good in it,” says Surbhi. Wear it right Designer Pallavi Singhee shares tips on how to get the right yellow glow in your Indian and Western look. Go traditional Butter yellow silk saris suit traditional occasions, while yellow cotton kurtas work best for casual outings. “Celebrate floral and geometric designs in butter yellow. Pair butter yellow Indian wear with gold necklaces and earrings. You could also contrast them with bright colours like pinks and oranges,” she adds. Add a metallic touch with silver or bronze clutches, sandals, or belts. Modern chic Team a butter yellow shirt with a pair of pants or a skirt in white, black or grey. “Pairing a yellow top with denim jeans works well. A jacket or a blazer amps up a stylish, casual look,” she says. Brown belts, shoes, or bags complement yellow outfits. One could get these accessories in shades of mustard or sunflower yellow. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Who doesn’t like an organised bedroom? An efficient wardrobe can help you achieve that. A good design allows you to keep clothes, shoes, accessories and other items in place in an accessible manner. It is a crucial addition to any room as it serves a dual role — of storing one’s belongings as well as enhancing the aesthetics of the room. With the market offering multiple options to choose from, here are some pointers to keep in mind when purchasing an almirah. What’s your type? Wardrobes are broadly of two types — built-in and freestanding. A built-in, walk-in or integrated closet is perfect for a house that you own or will not be moving out from for a while. A standalone or freestanding wardrobe is for people who relocate often. “While these are lightweight and can be moved around easily, one will have to compromise on space here. On the other hand, a built-in wardrobe or walk-in closet is often a permanent solution, and can also be used as a changing corner, depending on how it’s designed,” says Akriti Suheja, a Pune-based interior design consultant. Size matters Refer to interior design magazines or consult with an interior designer before deciding on the size of your wardrobe. Sandeep Sharma, an interior and home designer from Chennai, says that “it is important to identify your room size and be clear about the measurements of the wardrobe you want”. There are several things to keep in mind. Firstly, measure your available floor space. Keep in mind the wardrobe height so that it can be placed at the right spot. “Height is important to hang your clothes and arrange them and other things on shelves,” he adds. The recommended height for a wardrobe is 45 inches or more. Understand your storage requirements. For example, if your clothes are dominated by formal wear like dresses, blazers, saris or salwar suits, you will need several compartments to hang them. “If you own several accessories and shoes, multiple drawers and shelves are a must to organise them. Ideally, choose a wardrobe that has an overhead storage space. You can use that to store items that you use seasonally or don’t use often,” says Akriti. Deeper shelves are preferred since they can provide more storage space. However, make sure that the total measurement is not more than 15 to 20 inches as your apparel will not be easily accessible, she adds. When placing the wardrobe in your room, make sure it is not blocking any window or light source. “Keep adequate distance between the rest of your furniture and the wardrobe so as to maintain a clean look and allow easy movement,” Akriti says. Match your style Make a note of the kind of furniture used in your bedroom. If the bed, chairs and other furnishing are done in a specific wood (such as rosewood or teakwood), it is ideal to find a wardrobe, which complements the same texture. “Take in account the wall shade used in the room too,” Sharma says. The most preferred material for any wardrobe is hardwood. “Take care of such a wardrobe by getting it polished on a regular basis. It is important to do this to keep the wood termite-free,” he adds. Deciding if you want a wardrobe with swing doors or sliding ones is also important. “Swing doors are a traditional choice but they hog space when opened. Sliding doors look modern and they are an efficient option for smaller rooms,” he elaborates. If your bedroom features ornate furnishing, buy a wardrobe with embellished doors. For a neat yet modern look, choose a doorless wardrobe or a wardrobe with translucent doors. “Pick shades that match the room’s existing colour palette,” Sharma adds. Acrylic or plastic wardrobes are available in various colours and work best for children’s rooms. #Elections2024"

The attacks - Just before 6 pm local time (1500 GMT) on Sunday, gunmen with automatic weapons attacked an Orthodox church and a synagogue in Derbent, home to an ancient Jewish community and a UNESCO World Heritage site, the interior ministry said. - Russian media carried footage of the synagogue on fire. Izvestia newspaper said two gunmen ran into the Orthodox church, tried to set fire to its main icon and then opened fire. - At the same time, gunmen also attacked a traffic police post in the local capital of Makhachkala, about 125 km (75 miles) north of Derbent, the ministry said. - Gun battles ensued between law enforcement agencies and the attackers. There was heavy shooting around the Assumption Cathedral in Makhachkala and reports of gunfire on a beach. Repeated automatic gunfire rang out across both cities. - A counter-terrorism regime that allows authorities greater powers to clamp down on people's movement and communications was declared in the region overnight before being lifted early Monday. The victims Sergei Melikov, the head of the Dagestan region, said more than 15 policemen had been killed as well several civilians, including an Orthodox priest, Nikolai Kotelnikov, who had worked for more than 40 years at the church in Derbent. Izvestia said he was killed in front of family members. He was the only confirmed casualty of the attacks. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church , called for resistance to any attempts to radicalise religion. \"I am convinced that it is necessary to do everything possible to exclude the very possibility of attempts to radicalize religious life, to stop any manifestations of extremism and interethnic hostility in any form,\" Kirill said. \"The present and future of our country largely depends on this,\" he said. The attackers Six attackers were killed, Melikov said. Russian Telegram channels showed young men in pools of blood on the street who those posting the images said were the attackers. Russia's state media cited law enforcement as saying that among the attackers had been two sons of the head of central Dagestan's Sergokala district, and that they had been detained by investigators. Another of the attackers was his nephew. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. \"We understand who is behind the organisation of the terrorist attacks and what goal they pursued,\" Melikov said, adding that foreign forces had been involved in preparing the attack. \"This is an attempt to cleave apart our unity.\" #Elections2024"

Located near National Highway in Bengaluru Urban district, the restaurant was penalised by First Additional District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission when they visited the place on June 19. On July 30, 2022, the complainant—a 56-year-old woman named Tahara, resident of Kormangala, was on her way to Hassan for a family trip when she made a pit stop at the above mentioned restaurant for breakfast. She claimed that the food which was served to her was cold and not fresh at all. However, when she complained regarding the same, her concerns were rudely brushed off and she was told they could not provide her with 'hot' food. Tahara further stated that due to her having high blood pressure, she was unable to have the food and could not take her medicines. Commission president B Narayanapappa fined the restaurant Rs 5,000 for deficiency of service. He also fined the eatery Rs 2,000 to recover litigation expenses, Indian Express reported. Over the past few months, many food outlets have come into the limelight over their tendency of serving unhygienic food to customers. Many a time, dead animals or insects can be found in the food these restaurants serve. Recently, an Ahmedabad eatery served a dead rat dipped in sambar at a popular place called the Devi Dosa restaurant in Nikol. On the other hand, a woman in Noida found a centipede in an ice-cream tub that she ordered online. Similar incident occurred, when a family discovered a dead mouse in the bottle of Hershey's chocolate syrup which they had ordered using Zepto.

A report by The Times of India , now points to a series of errors that may have lead to the deadly crash. Serving and retired railway officials told TOI that it pointed to a systemic failure in the Katihar Division of the Northeast Frontier Railway where the accident took place. The article points out that the automatic signal failure occurred between Rangapani and Chatter Hat at around 5:50 am. According to Frontline , railway rules state that in case of such breakdowns the system of Working changes from Automatic Block System to Absolute Block System when failure is declared as “prolonged”. In this case, no such declaration was made by the divisional operations managers (DOM) for three hours. The report further said railway rules specify that when automatic signals fail, a train has to stop for a minute or so at each signal, and must travel at less than 10 km per hour between signals. Moreover, trains require a paper authority called T/A 912 as well as a “line clear ticket” to pass the signals. However, reports suggest that seven trains had passed the Rangapani station before the Kanchanjunga Express. Frontline reports that a paper authority , was issued to all seven trains as well as the Kanchanjunga Express and the goods train that collided with it. Kanchanjunga Express reportedly stopped at every station. Railway laws further say, in case of signal failures in a particular section there should be only one train on the Up track and one on the Down track. However, this was not followed. The station master issued the paper authority to the goods train without verifying whether Kanchanjunga Express had reached the next station which is Chatterhat. Another important aspect, the “line clear ticket”, which is the second part of the permission required to move ahead, was not issued to any of the trains. This implies that this norm was flouted. #Elections2024"

Jawans of the 146th battalion at Madhubana border outpost in Berhampore sector noticed suspicious movement of 5-6 persons who were trying to cross the unfenced stretch of the international border into India along with two bovine animals early on Sunday. Upon being challenged, they threatened the jawans by brandishing sharp weapons. When one of the jawans fired a stun grenade at them, they surrounded him and attacked him with sharp weapons. In self-defence, the jawan fired two rounds, following which the miscreants fled towards Bangladesh, taking advantage of the dark and tall crops in the fields, the statement said. The jawans later seized two medium-sized bulls and two sharp weapons from the spot. The possibility of any of the miscreants getting injured in the firing cannot be ruled out, it said. A similar incident occurred a day back when jawans of the 70th battalion at Lodhia border outpost in Malda spotted the movement of 14-15 Bangladeshis carrying spears and swords. As the smugglers crossed the border and entered India, the jawans fired a stun grenade to disperse them. However, the intruders attacked the jawans with sharp weapons, following which the BSF personnel fired two rounds in self-defence, the statement said. The smugglers then retreated to the Bangladesh side under the cover of darkness. Following this incident, a meeting was held with Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB), where a protest was lodged against the unprovoked attack by Bangladeshi smugglers. The two incidents were preceded by similar recent attacks at Madhubana. \"We have flagged the issue with BGB,\" a BSF spokesperson said. #Elections2024"

Chouhan and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who is BJP's election co-incharge for Jharkhand, held a meeting with party leaders, MLAs, MPs, and workers in Ranchi to prepare strategies for the assembly elections in the state due later this year. He said the BJP had an outstanding performance in the recently concluded Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand where it won eight seats and its ally AJSU Party bagged one. “We had a lead in 52 of the 81 assembly seats in the parliamentary polls. The state played an important role in securing the third term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I congratulate the party leadership, booth workers and people of Jharkhand for the achievement,” he said. The party will work under the leadership of Babulal Marandi and form the next government in Jharkhand in the upcoming assembly polls, he said. Chouhan alleged that the current JMM-led dispensation in the state is \"India’s most corrupt government\". “There is loot everywhere in the state, be it sand, coal, mines and minerals. The chief minister is in jail and many leaders are being arrested on charges of corruption,” he said. Chouhan said that it has become \"necessary to free Jharkhand from bad governance and reinstate the BJP’s good governance to make the state 'Viksit' (developed) Jharkhand\". Earlier, Chouhan and Sarma planted trees at ICAR, Namkum campus and Lichi Bagan in Ranchi's Hatia area as part of the party's 'Ek ped maa ke naam' initiative. \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi is concerned about the environment.

It has been found that three teachers are posted in a junior basic school which has only 13 students, while many schools are facing shortages of teaching staff. The problem of such distribution of teachers may be addressed by the exercise\", he said. Responding to the move, the state's youth Congress leader MD Shajahan Islam alleged that the BJP-led double-engine government has been \"forcing the poor students to get admission to private-run schools. \"The BJP government has failed to improve the education system in its six-year rule. We came to know that the education department has initiated a process to close down 160 schools in West Tripura district alone, citing less-enrolment. Where will the poor students go? The youth Congress strongly protest the move\", he said. CPI (M)-backed Tribal Students' Union general secretary Sujit Tripura claimed that the government has been trying to shut down many schools in rural and tribal areas to deprive the tribal students of education. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The CBI on Sunday took over the probe into alleged irregularities in the medical entrance exam NEET-UG following a reference from the Union education ministry, while the National Testing Agency cracked the whip against more students as it debarred 17 from centres in Bihar after detection of \"malpractices\". With a section demanding the cancellation of the May 5 exam, the ministry officials reiterated the government's earlier stand that the incidents of malpractices were \"localised\" or \"isolated\" and it was not fair to jeopardise the careers of lakhs of candidates who cleared the exam rightfully. In an optional retest held for students whose grace marks were scrapped after the matter reached the Supreme Court, only 813 of the 1,563 such candidates appeared on Sunday. These candidates were awarded grace marks by the NTA to make up for the loss of time at six centres due to a delay in the start of the examination on May 5. There were allegations that it led to inflation of marks and contributed to six of the grace mark candidates from the same centre in Haryana scoring a perfect 720 marks along with 61 others. \"At least 52 per cent -- 813 out of 1,563 candidates -- appeared for the retest on Sunday. While no candidate appeared in Chandigarh, the number of candidates appearing from Chattisgarh (291), Gujarat (1), Haryana (287) and Meghalaya (234),\" a senior National Testing Agency (NTA) official said. Over 13 lakh candidates out of around 25 lakh qualified the NEET-UG this year and they will compete for around 1.8 lakh MBBS/dental seats. Amid allegations of irregularities as well as \"bunching of high scorers\", the NTA stated that the top one lakh candidates are spread across 4,500 centres all over the country. Moreover, nearly two third of these are from rural or semi-rural areas, it stated. The Bihar Police's Economic Offences Unit (EOU) handed over a report to the Education Ministry on Saturday following which the probe was handed over to CBI for comprehensive investigation. \"Based on the inputs received 17 candidates who appeared from centres in Bihar were debarred. This takes the number of total candidates debarred from the exam this year to 110,\" an NTA official added. The agency had earlier debarred 63 candidates for adopting unfair means in the exam. On Saturday, 30 additional candidates from Gujarat's Godhara were also debarred. Amid countrywide protests and litigation by aspirants, the CBI filed the FIR in connection with alleged irregularities in NEET-UG under IPC sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating) among others. Officials said the ministry alleged in a complaint, now part of the FIR, to the agency that \"certain isolated incidents\" occurred in a few states during the conduct of the examination. \"The ministry of education has requested the CBI to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the entire gamut of alleged irregularities, including conspiracy, cheating, impersonation, breach of trust and destruction of evidence by candidates, institutes and middlemen,\" a CBI spokesperson said. The role of public servants, if any, connected with the conduct of the examination and also into the entire gamut of events, and the larger conspiracy will also be under the scanner, according to the officials. Meanwile, the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) questioned two teachers who run a private coaching centre in Latur district in connection with the alleged irregularities. The Centre had on Saturday night removed NTA DG Subodh Kumar Singh and put him on \"compulsory wait\" till further orders. The opposition stepped up its attack on the government over the issue, with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Sunday demanding Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan's resignation. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said the buck stops at the doorstep of the top echelons of the Modi Government and shuffling the bureaucrats is no solution. Party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra alleged the Modi government has handed over the entire education system to the \"mafia\" and the \"corrupt\" after the Centre cancelled UGC-NET and postponed NEET-PG and CSIR-UGC-NET. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin said the cancellation of exams was not a one-off event \"but the final nails in the coffin of an incompetent and broken system of centralised selection\". The BJP, however, asserted the government has taken on the NEET issue \"head on\". \"It notified the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024, appointed a high powered committee to look at streamlining exam process and eliminating lose ends, sacks NTA DG, orders CBI probe in NEET (UG), besides postponing several exams, preempting possible compromises, to safeguard student interest,\" BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya said. He alleged that the Congress' ally RJD was linked to the paper leak in Bihar and its leaders should not use the issue for their \"dirty politics\". The Union education ministry's high-level panel for suggesting exam reforms and reviewing functioning of the National Testing Agency will meet on Monday, sources said. The ministry had on Saturday notified the seven-member panel headed by former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chief K Radhakrishnan to ensure transparent, smooth and fair conduct of examinations through the NTA. On Sunday, the NTA also clarified that its website and all its other web portals are fully secure, and reports that these have been compromised and hacked are wrong and misleading. \"NTA website and all its web portals are fully secure. Any information that they have been compromised and hacked is wrong and misleading,\" a senior official said. The NEET-UG was held on May 5 across 4,750 centres and around 24 lakh candidates appeared. The results were expected to be declared on June 14 but were announced on June 4. The NEET-UG examination is conducted by the NTA for admissions to MBBS, BDS, AYUSH and other related courses in government and private institutions across the country. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday instructed disaster management officials to upgrade the forecast system of water level of rivers and ensure optimum use of satellite imagery provided by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) for better flood management. His remarks came at a high-level meeting called to review the preparedness of flood management in the country. He also reviewed long-term measures to formulate a comprehensive and far-reaching policy to mitigate the menace of floods in the country. He also reviewed the preparations to deal with Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF). At the meeting, he also instructed officials to take appropriate precautionary measures to prevent incidents of forest fire, including creating fire lines and removing dry leaves. Appealing to the states to timely implement the advisories issued by NDMA for flood management, he directed the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Central Water Commission (CWC) to complete the process of recalibrating all the equipment used in flood forecast, at the earliest. There is a need to integrate weather, rainfall and flood warning related apps developed by various departments so that their benefits could reach the targeted population, he said. Natural drainage system should be an integral part of the designs of road construction to deal with inundation of roads, in case of floods, he said. He also asked officials to ensure that floodgates of all the major dams are in good condition and that the flood monitoring centres of the CWC should be in accordance with requirements and of international standards. At least 50 large ponds in the north-east should be constructed so that the water of the Brahmaputra River could be diverted and stored in those ponds, he said adding this will help in developing agriculture, irrigation and tourism in those areas at a low cost and also help in tackling the floods, and, it will eventually benefit the local economy. To tackle forest fires, he said there is a need to regularly create fire lines, remove dry leaves and conduct mock drills from time to time with local residents and forest personnel. Along with this, he also asked to analyse the incidents of repeated forest fires at the same place. He also said that the IMD’s alerts regarding lightning strikes should be disseminated to the public on time through SMS, TV, FM radio and other mediums. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: Even as a row continues to unfold around the irregularities of entrance exams, especially the NEET and NET exams, only 813 of the 1,563 students who were to appear for a retest due to grace marks in the NEET-UG exam took the test. Ministry sources said that tests took place across seven centres around the country. Additionally, in Bihar, due to cheating and malpractices as many as 17 students have been served notices across 13 centres. The government is preparing to face a volley of charges in the Special Session of the Parliament, which starts on Monday, over irregularities in the exams. The ministry on Saturday sacked NTA chief Subodh Kumar Singh and passed the case of paper leaks in Bihar to the CBI, with officials saying that officials of the agency were under the scanner. Ministry sources said that the maximum number of students who were taking the NEET-UG retest after a Supreme Court order were from Haryana – retests took place in two centres in Jhajjar. In one centre, of 312 students who were to take the retest, only 178 (57.05 per cent) appeared, and in another 109 of 182 students (59.89 per cent) students appeared. In Meghalaya’s Tura, only 234 of the 464 students (50.4 per cent) appeared for the retest on Sunday, and in Gujarat, a lone student took the test. In Chandigarh, none of the 2 students took the test, and in Chhattisgarh, in one centre, 115 of the 185 students appeared (62.16 per cent) and in another, 176 of 412 students (42 per cent) appeared. Ministry officials said that across 13 of Patna’s 70 centres, 17 students have been served notice for malpractices. “Of the 19 students identified, notice was served to 17 students because in two cases the name and roll numbers did not match,” ministry sources said. Officials also said that in the NEET-UG test, 1 lakh top-ranking students were spread out across 4,650 centres, which they said pointed that students from more areas were doing better. The government is expecting a stormy start to the first session of the 18th Lok sabha over the issue. Officials, however, cited a 1986 recommendation which asked for an exam body to be formed. “The CBSE had been doing this for years; it is only in 2017 that the exam body was finally formed,” an official said. While the NEET-UG exams were first under the scanner due to grace marks given to 1,563 students, cases of paper leaks have emerged from Bihar; the education ministry has termed them “localised” instances. The UGC-NET exams were then cancelled, following which the CSIR-UGC-NET and the NEET-PG exams were cancelled because the government felt the exam process was compromised. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi/Patna: A CBI team probing alleged irregularities in the conduct of the UGC-NET examination was allegedly attacked by locals in Bihar's Nawada after which four persons were arrested by police on a complaint from the central agency, officials said Sunday. The incident occurred on Saturday evening when a team of CBI had gone to Kasiadeeh village in the area, they said. \"A team of CBI officials was gheroed, manhandled and attacked by a group of villagers in Kasiyadih village, under the jurisdiction of Rajauli police station, at around 4.30 pm on Saturday,\" the office of the Superintendent of Police of Nawada said in a statement. \"Immediately after receiving the information, a team of police officials led by the station house officer (SHO) of the Rajauli police station reached the spot and pacified the villagers, following which the situation was brought under control,\" it said. Police registered a case and arrested four persons in connection with the incident. It is believed that a driver of the CBI vehicle sustained a minor injury in the attack, sources said. According to local police officials, villagers thought that the sleuths were imposters who were falsely claiming to be CBI officials after they reached the village looking for some suspects allegedly involved in the UGC-NET question paper leak case based on the location of their mobile phone numbers. \"CBI officials were looking for a villager - Phool Chand - in connection with the UGC-NET question paper case case. They seized two mobile phones from the house of Phool Chand,\" said a senior police official in Nawada on the condition of anonymity. An FIR was filed by the local police against the accused on charges of causing disruption in government work and assault, among others. The local police arrested four persons allegedly involved in the attack and they have been sent to judicial custody, they said. Meanwhile, the CBI has asked a Kushinagar-based youth to appear before it in connection with the UGC-NET alleged paper leak case. The youth who was questioned on Saturday at Padrauna police kotwali in Kushinagar in Uttar Pradesh has been asked to join the investigation at the CBI Headquarters in Delhi on Monday, the officials said. The CBI had registered an FIR into the UGC-NET paper leak case on Thursday against unidentified people on a reference from the Union education ministry. The UGC-NET-2024 exam for the selection of junior research fellows, assistant professors and PhD scholars was conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) on June 18 in two shifts across the country. The next day, the University Grants Commission received inputs from the National Cyber Crime Threat Analytics Unit of the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (l4C) that the paper was available on the darknet and allegedly being sold for Rs 5-6 lakh on messaging platforms, sources said. According to the complaint from the education ministry, the inputs from I4C, which functions under the Union home ministry, \"prima-facie indicate that the integrity of the examination may have been compromised\", officials said. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Guwahati: The flood situation in Assam improved on Sunday as the number of people reeling under the deluge in eight districts decreased to over two lakh, an official bulletin said. According to the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), more than 2,07,500 people are hit by the flood in Bajali, Barpeta, Cachar, Darrang, Goalpara, Kamrup, Karimganj and Nalbari districts. Karimganj is the worst hit with over 1.1 lakh people suffering, followed by Cachar with almost 52,500 and Darrang with nearly 30,000 citizens reeling under floodwater, it added. Till Saturday, over 2.6 lakh people were suffering from the deluge in 11 districts of the state. The total number of people losing their lives in this year's flood, landslide and storm stands at 39. Meanwhile, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said at least 50 large ponds should be created in the northeast region to divert water of the Brahmaputra river to help tackle floods and develop agriculture, irrigation and tourism. Chairing a review meeting in Delhi on preparedness for flood management during the monsoon, Shah also emphasised on optimum use of satellite imagery provided by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) for flood and water management. Reacting to the suggestions, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the high-level review meeting sets the tone for further flood management and ensures that the administration moves forward with a 'Zero Casualty Approach'. \"Creating large ponds to divert floodwater from Brahmaputra, as discussed in the meet, will aid in multiple ways- reduce impact of floods, boost tourism and recharge water levels in the area,\" Sarma said in a post on X. Regarding the ongoing flood situation in the state, he said the government is committed to tackling the impact of the deluge effectively and the entire administration is on alert. The administration has been operating 211 relief camps and relief distribution centres in 10 districts, where 79,325 people have taken shelter at present, according to the official bulletin. The authorities have distributed 1,110.11 quintals of rice, 206.43 quintals of dal, 61.95 quintals of salt and 6,194.48 litres of mustard oil among the flood victims of the state during the last 24 hours. At present, people of 810 villages are reeling under floodwater and 4,274.13 hectares of crop areas have been damaged across Assam, the ASDMA said. Embankments, roads, bridges and other infrastructure have been damaged by floodwater in Darrang, Kamrup and Bajali. The Kushiyara river at Karimganj town is flowing above the danger mark, the ASDMA said. On account of widespread flooding, over 1,70,495 domestic animals and poultry are affected across the state. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Kolkata: The Trinamool Congress on Sunday protested against the move by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to start negotiations with Dhaka for the renewal of the 1996 agreement between India and Bangladesh for the sharing of water of the Ganges. The TMC, which is in power in West Bengal, alleged that the Centre did not consult the state government before going ahead to start the negotiations for the renewal of the agreement between India and Bangladesh. The party is likely to take up the matter in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, arguing that the Centre must consult the state governments before moving ahead and starting negotiations with Dhaka for the renewal of the treaty. The TMC supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had in 2011 stalled a move by the then Congress-led government in New Delhi to ink an agreement with Dhaka for the sharing of water of Teesta, another common river that flows from India to Bangladesh. Modi had a meeting with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh in New Delhi on Saturday. The two sides agreed on the formation of a Joint Technical Committee to initiate discussions for the renewal of the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty of 1996. The treaty signed on December 12, 1996, has a validity of 30 years but had a provision for both sides to renew it after negotiations. New Delhi and Dhaka have more than two years to negotiate for the renewal of the treaty. The 1996 agreement stipulated a formula for the sharing of water of the Ganges between upper riparian India and lower riparian Bangladesh at Farakka Barrage, a barrage built in the 1970s across Bhagirathi, one the headstreams of the transboundary river system, near the India-Bangladesh border. Banerjee had in September 2011 opted out of then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s entourage to Bangladesh, protesting against New Delhi’s bid to strike a deal with Dhaka for sharing water of Teesta. She had argued that the farmers of West Bengal depend much on the water of Teesta and the deal would hit them hard. Her protest had stalled the signing of the agreement. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore arrived at the International Space Station recently and now it has been reported that the Indian-origin astronaut and others might be in danger due to a 'space bug'. This bug can cause health issues by infecting the astronaut's respiratory system and leaves other crew members vulnerable to infection as well. Astronauts work in confined environments in space, survivng on limited supplies of water. Their experiements require strict containment, and it becomes even more vital to control any contamination under such circumstances, the European Space Agency explains . Like all humans, astronauts remain vulnerable to infectious diseases. On ISS, which orbits about 400 km above earth, bugs that are found are closely monitored and their physiology is studied to see if the organisms are in any way impacted in the space environment. IIT Madras researchers and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) are currently studying multi-drug resistant pathogens found on the ISS. Their study focuses on the Enterobacter bugandensis bacterial species isolated from the ISS. This bacterial strain is believed to have evolved, becoming more potent within the closed environment of the space station. NASA has been studying this bacteria for a while, and in April, reported \"Thirteen strains of E. bugandensis , a bacterium notorious for being multi-drug resistant, were isolated from the ISS.\" As per the study, due to stress, the strains isolated in the ISS had mutated, becoming \"genetically and functionally distinct compared to their Earth counterparts.\" As per NASA, these strains could persist in the ISS over time, and has co-existed with other microorganisms, even possibly helping other organisms survive in some cases. \"Our comprehensive analysis illuminated not only the ways these interactions sculpt microbial diversity but also the factors that might contribute to the potential dominance and succession of E bugandensis within the ISS environment,\" the study published in Microbiome says. There are two-fold implications of these findings. Firstly, they help understand microbial behaviour, how they adapt, and how evolution works in extreme, isolated environments. Secondly, these findings 'underscore the need for robust preventive measures, ensuring the health and safety of astronauts by mitigating risks associated with potential pathogenic threats.' NASA noted that closed human-built environments like the ISS are unique areas which provide extreme environments subject to microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide levels, and radiation. Microorganisms introduced to these areas must adapt in order to survive, NASA added. \"By delving into microbial dynamics in extreme environments, this research opens doors to effective preventative measures for astronaut health,\" the space agency has said. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Mumbai: India's Kotak Mahindra Bank will increase its pace of opening new branches and add about 175 to 200 branches in the financial year 2024-25, a senior official at the bank said, months after the central bank barred the private lender from sourcing new customers digitally. In April, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stopped Kotak from adding new customers via its online and mobile banking channels, and from issuing new credit cards, due to information technology-related deficiencies. \"We have been adding roughly 150 odd branches for several years now. This year too, the momentum is going to continue,\" Virat Diwanji, group president and head - consumer bank, told Reuters in an email interview on Monday. India's fourth-largest private lender will target the pockets where there is easy availability of deposits, the official said, adding that customer acquisition through branches is seeing good traction. Before the RBI's order, Kotak was heavily reliant on digital channels to source new clients. About 95 per cent of its new personal loans by volume were disbursed digitally in the October-December quarter, while it issued 99% of new credit cards through digital channels. A similar breakup for the January-March quarter is not yet available. Kotak's branch addition plans may not immediately help source new customers, but the strategy may play out in the medium-to-longer term as it will increase its presence and reach, said Kranthi Baithini, director of equity strategy at WealthMills Securities. However, that will come with high overhead costs, he said. Meanwhile, the bank is working \"steadfastly\" to fulfill the RBI's requirements and return to business as usual, Diwanji said. The private lender has stepped up investments to fortify its IT systems, including steps to strengthen its digital payment security controls and meet regulatory data cybersecurity standards, he added. Kotak has hired over 530 employees in the last 12-15 months, a majority of them from tech backgrounds, he said. The bank's focus on personal loans and business loans will continue, Diwanji said. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : By Emma Bubola and Elisabetta Povoledo Rome: When reports spread that Pope Francis had used an offensive anti-gay slur while speaking to Italian bishops at a conference last month, many Catholics were both shocked and baffled. How could a pope known for his openness to and acceptance of LGBTQ+ people use homophobic slang and caution prelates about admitting gay men into seminaries? But the question, and the apparent inconsistency in Francis’ messaging, reflect the deep contradictions and tensions that underlie the Catholic Church’s and Francis’ relationship to homosexuality. The church holds that “homosexual tendencies” are “intrinsically disordered.” When it comes to ordination, the church’s guidelines state that people with “deep-seated” gay tendencies should not become priests. Yet ordination has also long been a refuge of sorts for homosexual Catholic men, according to researchers and priests, who say that at least thousands of clergymen are gay, though only a few are public about their sexual orientation because of the stigma it still carries in the church. While in the past all of these contradictions were muffled by an aura of taboo, Francis’ recent off-the-cuff comments have thrown them into the open. “The pope lifted the veil,” said Francesco Lepore, a former Latinist at the Vatican who left the church, came out as gay and became an activist. The issue is layered by long-standing prejudices, and the sexual abuse crisis that emerged two decades ago inflamed accusations by some bishops and conservative church media outlets that homosexuality was to blame, even though studies have repeatedly found there to be no connection between being gay and abusing minors. Despite evolutions in society, and Francis’ embrace of a more progressive approach, church teachings still describe homosexuality as a deviance and have enshrined that view in regulations and restrictions that critics say perpetuate a widespread homophobic outlook and fuel tensions. “Until they change the law, as long as homosexuality is viewed as a deviance and an illness, nothing will change under St. Peter’s cupola,” said Luciano Tirinnanzi, who wrote a book about LGBTQ people and the church. Yet the presence of gay clergy has been a constant throughout history. St. Peter Damian, an 11th-century monk, fought against “sins of sodomy” in the church. Dante Alighieri punished gay clerics by plunging them into hell in his “Divine Comedy,” and there are documented cases dating to the 16th century of prelates who were accused of performing homosexual acts and killed. (Records of priests, and even cardinals and popes, who were unchaste with women and even had children are also abundant.) Academics and prelates who promote LGBTQ+ rights said that for gay Catholic men, becoming a priest was long viewed as a way to neutralize and overcome the stigma once associated with their sexual orientation, and perhaps even suppress it through celibacy. “A large quantity of young religious men with homosexual tendencies looked for the sublimation of celibacy,” said Alberto Melloni, an Italian church historian. It is hard to know exactly how many priests are gay, as there are no trustworthy statistics, but in the United States, gay men probably make up at least 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the American Catholic clergy, according to dozens of estimates from researchers and gay priests gathered in a 2019 investigation by The New York Times . Some priests and activists say the number is closer to 75 per cent. “The Catholic Church would not be able to operate without its gay priests,” said Francis DeBernardo, the executive director of New Ways Ministry, a Maryland-based group that supports gay Catholics. “That is a simple fact.” But that is also something many in the church are uneasy with. Last month, Francis said that there was already too much gayness, though he used a pejorative to describe it, according to two bishops who attended the conference and confirmed the Italian media reports that triggered an apology from the Vatican. Asked about Francis’ usage of a slur, bishops blamed it on Francis’ relaxed and colorful conversation style. “When there are official speeches, he studies, but when he speaks off the cuff, a word that is not entirely ideal can also slip out,” said Luigi Mansi, the bishop of the Italian city of Andria. Bishop Francesco Savino, a vice president for the Italian bishops’ conference, blamed it on the fact that Francis is not a native Italian speaker. “When he talks, he uses terms that are a mix of Spanish, Argentine, Italian,” he said. Yet despite the surprising use of the slur, it is not the first time Francis has reflected the church’s opposition to having homosexual men enter the ministry. While he has acknowledged that many homosexual priests are good and holy, Francis has repeatedly expressed concern that homosexual candidates for priesthood can end up having relationships and living double lives. In another closed-door session in 2018, reported by the Italian news media, he said men with “deep-rooted” homosexual tendencies should not be allowed to enter into seminaries. Two years earlier, the pope greenlighted a document on priestly vocations that stated just the same, reprising a 2005 document approved by Benedict XVI. The clergy has interpreted these instructions in different ways. The church states that “homosexual men should not be admitted to the orders,” said Piero Delbosco, the bishop of Cuneo, Italy, adding that there could be some leeway to determine whether a candidate might overcome homosexual tendencies. Others, like Mansi, say that “the church doesn’t say that gay people can’t be ordained.” But, he added, the church believes ordination should be avoided because it is harder for gay men to “observe and live celibate for their entire lives.” Experts and prelates who promote LGBTQ+ rights strongly deny this claim. “There are three ways that that’s being interpreted,” said the Rev. James Martin, a high-profile supporter of making the church more welcoming to gay Catholics. It is either no to homosexual seminarians, no to people who cannot maintain celibacy or no to anyone for whom that is the most important thing in their life, he said. Francis’ messaging just added to the confusion, some said. “He needs to clarify his message a little better because it does get confusing,” said DeBernardo. “It doesn’t help the situation. It problematizes the situation.” The confusion, critics said, blurs the line between celibacy and homosexuality, shifting the focus from a legitimate preoccupation with priests who are not chaste to a blanket stigmatisation of all gay clergy. This, they say, can cause some potentially celibate gay men to be barred from ordination, and many more to simply hide their sexuality. The Italian bishops’ conference has adopted new rules that deal specifically with ordaining gay priests in Italy, said Savino. The rules, which are awaiting approval from the Vatican, are not yet public. Francis’ use of the slur was prompted by a question from an Italian bishop about the issue, bishops said. The topic of homosexuality, Savino said, is “very debated” at the moment, as bishops with a more “pragmatic” and “dynamic” approach would like to update the rules. But progressive pushes inside the church often face blowback and prejudice. Francis must play a delicate balancing act between a message of openness and inclusivity while recognising the more conservative sensibilities of the church that remain firmly anti-gay. When Francis last year allowed priests to bless same-sex couples, some bishops in conservative corners of the church pushed back. To placate them, the Vatican issued a statement that said that “local culture” should be taken into account when it came to applying the declaration, but that it would remain church policy. When interviewed on this topic, some bishops referred to homosexuality as a “pathological” condition, a “problem” or used expressions like “normal sexuality” to refer to heterosexuality as opposed to homosexuality. Even the church’s guidelines referring to “deep-seated homosexual tendencies” are “offensive,” Lepore said, because they convey the message that homosexuality can be transitory, healed and overcome. He added that Francis’ effective messages of openness would inevitably be undercut if church teachings and a large parts of the clergy continued to consider homosexuality a disorder and not a sexual orientation. “The difficulties, the rifts that the church lives,” he said. “It all comes from there.” #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : By James Stavridis For more than eight months, the Houthis — an Iranian-backed proxy group based in Yemen — have bedeviled the global shipping industry. The majority of world shipping suppliers, including both container ships and bulk oil carriers, have decided discretion is the better part of valor and are routing traffic away from the Red Sea and Suez canals. This is adding expensive additional days at sea to most routes flowing between Asia, Europe and North America. Kinks are developing in the global supply chains. On Wednesday, a salvage firm reported the sinking of a larger merchant vessel, MV Tutor. The Houthis say they are part of the “resistance” to Israel and are conducting these attacks — which have sunk at least two ships and killed several seafarers — in solidarity with the people of Gaza. They claim to be specifically targeting Western shipping, particularly ships with any connections to the United States or Israel. They have also deliberately targeted warships from the United States and its allies in the Gulf region, nearly hitting several with either land-based ballistic missiles, airborne drones or sea-skimming unmanned craft packed with explosives. Thus far, the Western response has been anemic, indecisive, and mostly defensive. NATO and Gulf Arab warships have shot down numerous drones, engaged some of the surface craft and launched a handful of strikes ashore at Houthi infrastructure that is directly tied to the attacks. Is it time to increase the level of offensive military firepower directed at the Houthis, or even at their sponsor state Iran? What are the risks and benefits of such a campaign, and what should it look like? My own experience in counter-piracy operations runs deep. In addition to a handful of such ops in Asia (notably in the Strait of Malacca), I commanded NATO’s counter-piracy mission for four years in the Red Sea and off the Horn of Africa as Supreme Allied Commander. We tried lots of different techniques against a far less capable force of Somali pirates — mostly teenagers with minimal training and equipment. Over time, we learned that playing defense — convoys, hardening the merchant ships with barbed wire, security details on large merchant ships, shared intelligence — was necessary but not sufficient. What we learned was that to defeat pirates operating from bases ashore you need to go ashore and neutralise the attacks before they successfully get out to sea. Once the pirates or their weapons — missiles, drones, unmanned high-speed boats — are in the open seaway, the challenges multiply. When we began to strike the pirate bases ashore, capture or kill the pirates and destroy their equipment, the threat gradually reduced. While the Houthis are far better trained, equipped and organized thanks to their masters in Tehran, the same principle applies: Go ashore. An effective campaign would consist of four phases. The first, as always, is to focus significant intelligence assets on building a coherent picture of exactly where Houthi strike assets and command and control are located. This will require a combination of overhead intelligence (including multi-spectral analysis), offshore communications intercepts, cyber intrusions, and possibly human intelligence gathered on the ground by cooperating agencies ( Saudi Arabia , Israel and other local national intelligence services along the Red Sea). US Central Command via the Fifth Fleet Commander in Bahrain should oversee this effort. The next phase would be strikes with both cruise missiles (e.g., US Tomahawks) against Houthi command and control centers. The Iranian intelligence services are clearly supporting this campaign, and the fused intelligence products are likely being developed in Yemen by the Houthis supported by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Striking such centers will blind the Houthis and reduce the lethality of their efforts. This should be accompanied by an effective information warfare campaign showing the costs of the strikes to the Houthi Yemenis and Iranians. The third phase of should consist of strikes conducted against the Houthi physical infrastructure used for the attacks — i.e., coastal radars, manned Houthi maritime craft (especially those with surface radars), land-based ballistic missile launchers, unmanned speed boats, maintenance facilities, ammunition caches and drone construction (and arming) centers. The Western coalition is finally beginning to conduct such strikes in earnest. Over the past few days at least six such strikes have been conducted against Kamaran Island near the Yemeni port city of Salif. This is the first set of strikes against what is clearly a center of the Houthi anti-ship capacity, a target set that should have been attacked long ago. The Port of Salif has also been implicated in the attacks on commercial shipping and Western naval forces. This is an example of the type of strikes that must be increased and directed not only against Salif and Kamaran Island, but also other Houthis centers ashore. Fourth and finally, a campaign plan against the Houthis must include severing their supply chain back to Iran. This is challenging but not impossible. Clearly, Iran is providing not only intelligence but also hardware, including components for drones, ballistic missiles and unmanned speed craft. These are being sourced via the Iranian military complex (which is also providing drone support to Russia for its war against Ukraine). This may require striking Iranian assets directly, to include their intelligence-gathering ships in the Red Sea and North Arabian Sea; offshore Iranian intelligence gathering platforms outside the Arabian Gulf; Iranian logistic vessels moving weapons and components to Yemen. Some may find direct strikes against Iranian sovereign assets too provocative. I’d invite anyone looking at the situation to reflect on the direct attacks thus far — now numbering in the dozens — of ballistic missiles and drones shot down (fortunately) by US warships. If one of those ballistic missiles were to get through and strike a US destroyer with a tightly packed crew of 350 sailors, we would be very close to a war with Iran. Better to send a strong signal now than to have to react with overwhelming firepower against Tehran after US casualties. There is certainly sufficient firepower in the North Arabian Sea, including the massive US aircraft carrier USS Dwight Eisenhower and supporting cruisers and destroyers armed with cruise missiles, to undertake a significant bombing campaign. Our allies, both the Gulf Arabs and NATO partners, are likewise engaged. With the right campaign plan, we can inflict sufficient damage to the Houthis to cause them to cease and desist. We need the will to do so. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Although Prime Minister Narendra Modi has signalled a continuation in foreign policy in his third term by not changing his external affairs minister, the world is perhaps treating him differently. This is most evident in India granting permission to a US Congressional delegation’s visit to the Dalai Lama recently. India’s facilitation of the delegation is being projected as sending a signal to Beijing before the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Astana, Kazakhstan’s capital on July 3-4. China’s President Xi Jinping and Modi are likely to meet there. The meeting will take place four years after the loss of an estimated 2,000 sq km of India’s land to China along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. India has claimed that five of the seven contentious border issues in Ladakh — Depsang, Galwan, Gogra, Kakjung, the north bank of Pangong lake, Kailash Range, and Demchok — have been resolved. Only Depsang and Demchok still need to be addressed. However, experts have pointed out that this ‘resolution’ is nothing more than ‘disengagement’ — the two sides agreeing to be separated by a few kilometres to avoid eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation. There is no actual de-induction of additional forces sent to Ladakh by either side, over the last four years. As for Depsang and Demchok , China has refused to even discuss disengagement from the transgressed points in the 21 rounds of border talks between Beijing and New Delhi. Further, China has refused to restore the status quo as it existed in April 2020 in all the disputed border points. Under these circumstances, what can a weakened Modi in his third term achieve by annoying China on the Tibet issue? It is quite likely, therefore, that the visit reflects arm-twisting by the US to push India towards a more proactive stance on Tibet. The bipartisan US Congressional delegation was led by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul and included known China-baiter , former House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Also, surprisingly since the Dalai Lama was scheduled to visit the US for medical treatment on June 20, McCaul, Pelosi, et. al. could as easily have met him there and assured him of US efforts to pressure China towards an ‘unconditional dialogue’ with him. The logistics suggest, therefore, that visiting him in India was staged to push New Delhi to commit to a more aggressive posture towards Beijing. It is important to ask why India permitted this politically charged byplay. India is being drawn into playing a provocative game without any significant means of controlling its outcome. It is one thing for the Prime Minister of India to have a warm exchange of messages on X (earlier, Twitter) with the President of Taiwan in the euphoria of an election victory, but quite another to signal a more forward foreign policy vis-à-vis China. ‘Every provocation in international affairs must have a clearly defined diplomatic objective. For example, when China renamed 30 places in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh in April 2024, it was asserting its claim over the territory which it calls South Tibet or Zangnan. However, there seems to be no clear goal in publicly displaying warmth towards Taiwan or allowing the seven-member US Congressional delegation to meet the Dalai Lama in India.’ India, in fact, does not support Taiwan’s independence from China. Following the ‘One China policy’, it has refrained from establishing full diplomatic ties with Taiwan . Taipei and New Delhi only maintain commercial, cultural, and educational ties through cultural centres and associations. In Tibet too, India officially has recognised the Tibet Autonomous Region as a part of China since 1954. Although the Sino-Indian Agreement, or the Panchsheel Agreement, lapsed on June 6, 1962, in the midst of the India-China War, India’s position on Tibet has remained unchanged. India reiterated its recognition of Tibet as a part of China in the joint declaration signed by India’s then Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and his counterpart Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in 2003. India’s position on Tibet has often been compared to China’s position on Kashmir . Each has a nuanced position without India questioning the sovereignty of China over Tibet and yet sheltering the Dalai Lama and Tibetan refugees, and China supporting Pakistan without explicitly questioning India’s sovereignty over Kashmir. If these policy positions still hold, then allowing US Congressmen to meet the Dalai Lama and express support in India for ‘the rights of the Tibetan people under international law, including their right to self-determination’, seems inexplicable. Moreover, by holding official meetings with the visiting US Congressional delegation the Modi government signalled support, though the discussion, it is reported, focussed on bilateral strategic partnership . Although the US also acknowledges Tibet as part of China, the Resolve Tibet Act passed by the two Houses of Congress (not signed by President Joe Biden as yet), advocates the right of Tibetans over their future — not ruling out independence. For India, however, advocacy of self-determination in Tibet is a departure from the past. India has not supported Tibetan independence earlier, nor allowed international leaders to meet the Dalai Lama in India or address the media. The other issue of concern for the international community is the succession of the Dalai Lama through reincarnation . The Dalai Lama, the 14th spiritual and political leader of the Tibetans, is not in the best of health, and will turn 89 on July 6. The Americans are worried about whether the reincarnation will take place in China and fear the political consequences of an atheist China choosing the next Dalai Lama. India, which borders Tibet and houses more than 72,000 Tibetan refugees will also have to deal with the fallout of the event. Experts believe that India should limit itself to facilitating the Dalai Lama and his senior advisers to choose his successor/reincarnation without getting too deeply involved in the process.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) saga has the potential to centrestage the issue of unemployment in Indian politics, and it is now up to the renewed Opposition to fight for the youth. June 4 was not only a turning point in Indian politics but also a day when the NEET examination results were prematurely announced, allegedly amidst the din of the election results — presumably to avoid any scrutiny. The Congress-led I.N.D.I.A. bloc has gained a significant footprint in national polity, and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failed to secure a simple majority of 272 seats in the Lok Sabha on its own. Political observers credit the strengthening of the Opposition to high inflation and massive unemployment, among several other reasons. In the middle of the campaign, when the news of the NEET paper leak started trickling in on May 6, the Congress was the first to react, with its top leadership attacking the Modi government. Importantly, the Congress’ campaign had a special focus on unemployment and recruitment in government jobs. Its much-debated manifesto promised not only a law on paper leaks, but also fast-track courts, monetary compensation for the aspirants, a Right to Apprenticeship Law to skill freshers entering the market, and a job calendar for filling, what Congress claimed, 3 million vacancies in government jobs. ‘Paper Leak Se Mukti ’, ‘ Pehli Naukri Pakki’, and ‘ Bharti Bharosa ’ — these guarantees espoused by the Congress, made it seem that the party was sincere in its outreach to the young voters, especially those who have borne the brunt of wasted years, preparing for government entrance examinations. It is not a surprise that Congress won the support of small towns, semi-urban centres, and rural India. The I.N.D.I.A. bloc benefitted heavily from this support in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Eastern Rajasthan — where joblessness, including issues of the Agnipath scheme, made sure that the young unemployed voted against the BJP. A CSDS-Lokniti post-poll survey states that even though the BJP was able to get about 37 per cent votes from those under the age of 35 years, the I.N.D.I.A. bloc closed this gap to 35 per cent under this category. The Congress has also consistently made the snatching of reservation of the SC, the ST, the OBC, and the EWS jobs, by not filling government vacancies a potent issue in this election. This has also had a spiralling effect in rural India. The NEET paper leak and the cancellation of the NET-UGC examination, both conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA), have yet again put the focus back on the youth. The future of 3.3 million students is at stake, with multiple cases being filed in the Supreme Court and the apex court warning the Union government that not even 0.001 per cent negligence in conducting the examination would be tolerated . The entire process of examinations to actual recruitment has become painstakingly cumbersome. Aspirants leave their small towns and villages, pawn their family silver on coaching for years, and toil hard, only to be told that the exam is cancelled due to paper leaks. Paper leaks for government recruitment have become a norm. In the last seven years, at least 70 paper leak cases have shattered the dreams of more than 20 million students. The dearth of government jobs, still a priority for most of the youth, is evident when a whopping 1.3 million students appear in the UPSC exam for a total of just 1,255 vacancies. In the NEET case, the Union education minister first called the allegations of paper leaks ‘motivated’. Later, when the news of the arrests in Bihar, Gujarat, and Haryana started pouring in, he retracted his statements by saying “some irregularities had come to light” at “some specific locations”. The UGC-NET 2024 exams were cancelled a day after it was conducted. I.N.D.I.A. bloc leaders were quick to demand the cancellation of NEET, on similar lines. It is important to note that out of the 100,000 NEET seats, around 55,000 are in government colleges where they are reserved for the SC, the ST, the OBC, and the EWS categories. The alleged massive rigging in the marks and ranks, which has been pointed out by the aspirants, has increased the cut-off for reserved seats for marginalised students. All this has not happened in a day. In the past decade, the Modi government has systematically sought to control every sphere of education — be it autonomous institutions like the NCERT, the UGC, the NTA, or even institutions of eminence such as the IIT, the IIM, and the FTII, among others. Universities, which are the fountainheads of idealism and dissent have been turned into mini-war zones where freedom of academics, researchers, and students have been mercilessly clamped upon by appointing mediocre acolytes from the Sangh parivar. No Indian university figures in the top 100 universities, globally. The BJP, in its arrogance and hurry to control every institution, sought to colourise education, and then privatise it. Privatisation is good if done under proper regulation, but the BJP even failed to implement that. Private universities, often owned by either politicians or big corporations, are forced to navigate the hurdles of excessive regulation by the State. Manufacturers are not able to hire skilled workers. About 83 per cent of those skilled under the much-hyped ‘Skill India Mission’ did not get any placement . Even though almost 10 million graduates pass out every year, 42.3 per cent of graduates under the age of 25 years remain unemployed. The 2024 Lok Sabha elections did not make a government, it made an Opposition. Now that the BJP’s political capital has severely diminished, its insecurity to control institutions must also be curtailed. The I.N.D.I.A. bloc, led by the Congress, has a significant part to play. Only then will our education and recruitment systems witness meaningful reforms.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Agriculture is the least-preferred occupation and the village, the least preferred home in India today, a far cry from the Gram Swaraj -- the republic of villages -- that Mahatma Gandhi envisaged. This dichotomy is rooted in India’s colonial history, and there has been a wide range of studies on the agrarian question and peasant struggles. ‘De-colonisation’ is a rather undramatic term for one of the most dramatic processes in modern history: the disintegration of empire as a political order, and the de-legitimisation of racial subjugation as the dominant structuring principle. What was missing in this discourse, though, was the question of power. It was in this backdrop that Ranajit Guha’s groundbreaking ‘Subaltern Studies’ appeared as the alternative dynamic, and presented the simple but obvious argument that the fundamental division in society was the one of the relations of domination and subordination. Guha’s Elementary Aspects of Peasant Insurgency (EAPI), published in 1983, is a classic work in subaltern studies and explores rebel consciousness during the Indian colonial period. EAPI describes from the peasants’ viewpoint the exploitative relations in rural India from 1783 to 1900. Peasant rebellions usually aimed not simply to expropriate property, but to reverse relations of domination and subordination, to “turn the world upside down”. They were marked by ‘negation’, a consequence of the fact that the peasant’s “identity amounted to the sum of his subalternity…he learnt to recognise himself not by the property and attributes of his own social being but by a diminution, if not negation, of those of his superiors”. The appearance of EAPI, created a ferment in such diverse disciplines as history, anthropology and literature, compelling a radical rethinking of knowledge and social identities authored and authorised by colonialism and western domination. EAPI is a powerful example of scholarship. In this wide-ranging study full of brilliant insights and methodological innovation, Guha returns to 19th-century peasant insurrections in colonial India. Reading colonial records and historiographical representations with a prescient eye, he presents a thought-provoking narrative of peasant-insurgent consciousness: mythic visions and bonds of community. Challenging the idea that peasants were powerless agents who rebelled blindly against British imperialist oppression and local landlord exploitation, Guha emphasizes their awareness and will to effect political change. He suggests that the rebellions represented the birth of a theoretical consciousness and asserts that India’s long subaltern tradition lent power to the freedom struggle led by Mahatma Gandhi. Early in EAPI, Guha writes that peasant revolt in colonial India “was traditional only insofar as its roots could be traced back to pre-colonial times, but it was by no means archaic in the sense of being outmoded; it was, in fact, as modern as elite politics”. It should be no surprise then that farmer revolts reappeared in the wake of the growing crisis of the Indian State in the 1970s, and have recurred since. The dominance of the nation-state, cobbled together during the nationalist struggle against British rule, became precarious with growing social and political inequalities and conflicts. The outbreak of powerful movements of different ideological hues -- not least JP’s Nav Nirman movement -- challenged the State’s claim to represent the people, and the State resorted increasingly to repression to preserve its dominance. Combining coercive measures with the powers of patronage and money, on the one hand, and the appeal of populist slogans and programmes, on the other, appear a recurring theme ever since for the State to gain legitimacy. How then might we situate India as a Republic at 75? Those interested in India and those inimical to it, describe it in different vocabularies. Such scholarship has usually been marked by a teleology in which the future of India often tends to be seen in the present of the western world. The evident differences are then listed as marks of an incomplete ‘transition’. Analysing India’s progress is often a search for what is wrong and its shortcomings, and of how far it has progressed in its ‘transition’ to where the West has already arrived. We need to reject this, not out of nationalist self-assertion, but because this approach stems from the inadequate de-colonisation of our minds. If we recognise that India’s long civilisation does not represent an earlier point in the arc of western historical development, it follows that articulating our future will require abandoning some of our conceptual vocabulary, born of our colonial past. To recall Jacques Derrida: “White mythology …remains active and stirring, inscribed in white ink, an invisible design covered over in the palimpsest.” Read Ranajit Guha’s EAPI. It tells you, without saying so, why India must seek its own ‘world view,’ independent of the western paradigm. And it is time to re-assert our autonomy, not as subalterns but as those who are now capable of writing our own history, free of colonialist or nationalist narratives. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Dinesh Saklani, the head of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), which prepares school-level textbooks in India, has argued that high school students should not have to learn about communal riots. “Why should we teach about riots in school textbooks?” Saklani asked, “We want to create positive citizens, not violent and depressed individuals.” The immediate context for these comments was the NCERT’s decision to remove from its textbooks references to the 2002 Gujarat riots and the demolition of the Babri mosque. Saklani argued that these lessons would be “offensive [and] create hatred in society.” If you’ve been reading this column regularly, you might recall that three years ago, I had, in fact, agreed with that logic. In a 2021 Z-Factor column titled “A case against History,” I had proposed that Indians should simply agree to bury the past and forget about it. I had cited the example of Rwanda, where people from across ethnic lines collectively decided to forget that country’s infamous genocide in the 1990s. Victims of the genocide refused to commemorate their losses because it brought back painful memories. People refused to ponder about it so that they could live with their neighbours without being haunted by their possible role in the violence. Yet, this approach only works if all of society decides to turn the page on violence. In parts of the world where violence was so widespread and gruesome that it scarred the mind, peace was made possible because memories of that pain brought people together. The costs of the two World Wars, for instance, made the European Union possible. Germany, which had until then had a long and storied history of warring with its neighbours, is today the most vocal champion of a pan-European identity. By contrast, India has made a habit of identity-based violence. According to data from the National Crime Records Bureau, India sees tens of thousands of incidents of rioting each year, including hundreds of cases driven by religious or caste identity. In recent years, ethnic violence has gripped places as diverse as Manipur and Delhi. But since communal riots are often localised, Indians have never had a nationwide reckoning of why they happen so often. Continued rioting has been reinforced by rising social bias and plummeting social trust. In 2021, a Pew survey found that only 23 per cent of Hindus and 29 per cent of Muslims felt that Hindus and Muslims had much in common with each other. 45 per cent of Hindus did not want to live next door to a non-Hindu neighbour. For Muslims, that figure was 36 per cent. In his comments this month, the NCERT chief rhetorically asked whether teaching about riots is the purpose of education. I would argue that countering these social biases should be the purpose of education. In that regard, the example I would cite for India is not Rwanda, but Singapore -- another country born out of bloody ethnic riots. In 1995, Singapore’s then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong announced that the national curriculum will teach students about the horrors of the 1964 race riots between ethnic Malays and Chinese, which had resulted in Singapore’s partition from Malaysia. Goh argued that this was necessary so that younger Singaporeans would recognise “what dangers lie just off the highway” and not “trip up over sensitive issues of race, language and religion.” The resultant curriculum aimed to educate young students about the domestic fault lines that can cause violence. Perhaps Indians need to do that, too. Today more than ever, Indians must recognise what causes violence and how they can avoid it. And maybe it’s also time to re-learn the essence of that dirty word, ‘secularism’. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : China’s recent aggression in every direction in its neighbourhood is leading to a storm building up for itself. Its massive and intrusive military build-up and exercises across the Taiwan Straits, South China Sea and on the borders with India are not only unnerving for the countries involved but are also causing them to push back. The non-resolution of the border stand-off since 2020 has created an armed stalemate on India’s borders. Another front, albeit a politico-diplomatic one, is opening on the Tibet issue with the US congressional delegation’s visit to Dharamshala. China upped the ante following the visit of Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan in August 2022 when she was Speaker of the US House of Representatives. China’s military crossed the median line that separates it from Taiwan, and has kept up its intimidatory tactics ever since. On April 8 this year, it conducted “combat readiness patrols” in response to US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s visit to Taiwan. These Chinese intrusions have intensified after Taiwan’s presidential elections earlier this year. Yet, it seems, Beijing’s two-pronged approach – applying military pressure from outside and running influence operations inside Taiwan -- are not working. China’s heightened political rhetoric on ‘One China’, frequent military activities, attempts to diplomatically isolate Taipei, or foment internal political struggles in Taiwan have raised concerns about potential miscalculation and accidents leading to an escalation in the Taiwan Straits. Another potential conflict is emerging in the South China Sea between China and the Philippines at the Second Thomas Shoal. China claims 80 per cent of the whole region, despite The Hague tribunal quashing its claims in July 2016. On June 17, China’s coastguard vessels rammed into a Filipino military boat, armed with a domestic legislation to seize any foreign personnel in the disputed seas. The ensuing skirmish left a Filipino soldier with a severed finger and two vessels destroyed. The incident came close to what Philippine President Marcos has declared as a red line – any Filipino casualty. The US invoked the 1951 Mutual Defence Treaty with the Philippines, but tensions did not subside. Closer home, China has not accepted the olive branch extended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his remarks to Newsweek last month. On the other hand, it has been exerting military pressure on the borders and in India’s neighbourhood, specifically in Maldives, Sri Lanka and Nepal. Despite 21 meetings at the military level for “dis-engagement and de-escalation” on the borders, three areas still remain contentious. China is opening another front in Tibet. In August 2020, China’s Communist Party began “sinicising Tibetan Buddhism” and enhanced Han Chinese intrusions. China built more than 600 “well-off society” villages on the borders with India, Nepal, Bhutan and was even preparing to do so in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir. Nearly one-third of these built-up structures came up on the path that the Dalai Lama took in 1959 while fleeing to India. It is an indication that Beijing is preparing to effect a transition to the 15th Dalai Lama. Beijing has announced that it will exercise a “golden urn” process of selecting the 15thDalai Lama, a bid to cause schisms among Tibetans. The bipartisan US congressional delegation’s visit to Dharamshala on June 18-19 came in the light of these developments and was meant to apprise the Dalai Lama of the Resolve Tibet Act that the Biden administration is considering signing into law. Among other things, the delegation suggested resumption of the stalled dialogue between China and Tibetan representatives, stopping Chinese disinformation about Tibetan history and culture and, intriguingly, “self-determination” for Tibet. While US delegation visits to Dharamshala are not exactly new, considerable interest and publicity was generated both due to the “self-determination” comment and the delegation’s meetings with PM Modi and External Affairs Minister Jaishankar. Since the Roosevelt administration in the early 1940s, the US has considered Tibet a part of China (under the then Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek). The US continued to follow this policy even after China came under Communist rule, only raising human rights issues from time to time. The Obama administration in its ‘G2’ phase with China downgraded the Tibet factor, signalled by Obama meeting the Dalai Lama in the Maple Room of the White House, meant for spiritual leaders, rather than in the Oval Room. Such obsequiousness toward China began to change with Obama’s ‘Pivot to Asia’, a change that accelerated under the Trump and Biden administrations. While India is cautious of the vagaries of US policy toward Beijing, the pounding pressure that China is exerting on Delhi may yet be a factor in how the Modi government views the Tibet issue going forward. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : When B R Ambedkar circulated the draft of the Constitution to the members of the Constituent Assembly in 1948, he expected criticism from the members on one aspect or the other. What he perhaps did not expect was that the most criticised Article of the draft Constitution would be Article 13 -- the article which guaranteed the fundamental freedoms of all Indian citizens. Article 13 of the draft Constitution guaranteed eight freedoms -- of speech, expression, peaceful assembly, association, movement, residence, ownership of property, and profession. With the exception of property, all these freedoms continue to be fundamental rights protected under Article 19 of the Constitution. The criticism was made, however, in the context of clauses (2) to (6) of the Article, which gave the government power to restrict these freedoms on several grounds. These, too, have continued as clauses (2) to (6) of Article 19 of the Constitution. Most of the criticism, as Ambedkar pointed out, seemed to be based on a misunderstanding of the American Constitution’s guarantee of civil liberties. While the American Constitution does not impose limits on freedoms, the US Supreme Court has upheld laws made to limit violent and dangerous speech, pointing out that there’s no such thing as an absolute right of freedom of speech. Not all members were convinced. In the ensuing debate over the draft Constitution, Mahboob Ali Baig wondered if any free speech could survive in the new republic if the hated colonial laws were allowed to continue under the exceptions found in Article 13. Zahirul Lari argued that all the many grounds for exceptions to the fundamental freedoms essentially reduced the rights to a “nullity”. When Article 13 was taken up for discussion on December 1-2, 1948, a number of amendments were suggested. Amendments moved by, among others, Damodar Swarup Seth and Hukam Singh wanted to do away with clauses (2) to (6) and deny the government any power to restrict rights. K M Munshi, as I’ve mentioned in a previous article, wanted to remove “sedition” as a basis for restricting free speech. As with the right to life and liberty, the question of fundamental freedoms got members very worked up. Thakur Das Bhargava and Ambedkar had a heated exchange which required the Chairperson to step in to calm tempers. The debate which took place on December 2, 1948, about this article is worth reading in full. It would be impossible for me to even try to summarise the diversity of views and concerns that were expressed by members both in support of and against the text of the draft Article 13. Notwithstanding Ambedkar’s technical response to them, members worried that clauses (2) to (6) of Article 13 gave governments too much power to restrict fundamental freedoms. At the heart of these concerns were the worries that British laws, which had been used so harshly against them, would continue to find justification under these clauses and continue to oppress Indians; that while democratic government was all very good, it meant nothing if the State continued to use the tools of colonial government to control the people. The pessimistic critics were outnumbered, however, by the optimistic supporters, and Article 13 passed with a couple of minor amendments which Ambedkar himself accepted as necessary to make the freedoms more robust. Despite the heated exchange, Ambedkar accepted Bhargava’s amendment adding the word “reasonable” to clauses (3), (4), (5) and (6) to limit what kind of restrictions could be placed by law on freedoms. Curiously, though, this word was not added to clause (1), which outlined restrictions on freedom of speech and expression, and it would take the First Amendment to the Constitution to make this change. Reading the debates on draft Article 13 in 2024 serves as a healthy reminder that the task of building the Indian Republic did not end in 1950 when the Constitution came into being. Governments will try to overreach their powers and citizens will have to act to keep them in check to preserve their fundamental freedoms. What the Constitution really does is to give us the democratic space to do this peacefully and reasonably. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : As the newly elected representatives for the 18th Lok Sabha prepare to join Parliament, it may be appropriate to reflect on the performance of the previous MPs from Karnataka and flag the lessons they hold for us. The most egregious failure of the previous MPs (17th Lok Sabha) from Karnataka, where 25 out of 28 were from the BJP, is the extent to which they reneged on their responsibilities to uphold and promote the state’s interests. Even as the BJP defied the cooperative federalism enshrined in the Constitution and imposed several draconian Acts, Karnataka’s BJP MPs either remained silent about such trends or sought to openly implement various RSS-BJP programmes in their constituencies. Worse yet, they failed to support Karnataka’s rights to fair allocation of GST funds and key programmes such as the MNREGS and drought relief. Will the new MPs continue to kowtow to the dictates of increasing centralisation, or will they boldly champion the interests of Karnataka? Will the new MPs — including three former chief ministers H D Kumaraswamy, Jagadish Shettar and Basavaraj Bommai — advocate for Karnataka’s rights to formulate its own laws regarding agriculture (a state subject) and land? Or, will Kumaraswamy, in his new avatar as Union Minister, privilege the unregulated expansion of extractive industries over the rights and interests of farmers? At the constituency level, most MPs of the 17th Lok Sabha had asserted their contribution as linked to promoting large-scale infrastructure projects such as airports, highways, high-speed trains etc., over that of providing basic infrastructure such as drinking water, sanitation, health and education facilities. Only four out of the 28 MPs took proactive and pro-people measures to address the dire food and health situation during the Covid-19 pandemic, indicating the extent to which the abandonment of emergency supervision by the MPs exacerbated distress in the state. Despite this track record of negligence towards constituents’ interests and well-being, several senior politicians were re-elected, which is a sign of the extent to which our electoral democracy is run on balancing the power equations of caste, capital and cultural idioms. Instead of upholding the rules of law and system functioning, elected representatives are often assessed by people based on personal access. They are deemed ‘good’ if they provide small personal favours or are socially amenable. This approach and the failure to make access to elected representatives a part of a transparent, democratic system has meant that citizens position themselves as supplicants. They seek favours via their elected representatives instead of asserting their citizenship rights through open and reliable systems with which the elected representative should be held accountable. The Prajwal Revanna case exemplifies this and indicates how such relationships — where elected representatives act as patrons and citizens as subjects or clients — undermine not only the democratic functioning of larger systems but also force citizens to become sacrificial victims, as seen in the Hassan case. Contrary to the expectations that they uphold the rule of law and promote comity and harmony in society, eight BJP MPs of the previous Lok Sabha indulged in hate speech, fuelled communal tensions and made misogynistic statements. That such a politics of hate cannot go far is evident in the case of Tejaswi Surya’s declining vote share despite the fact that he was re-elected from a constituency that consists of ardent supporters of the Modi-RSS-BJP dispensation. One hopes that this batch of MPs, comprising some seasoned politicians and seven re-elected members from the BJP, will strive to change the previous record and uphold the Constitution’s mandate of fostering fraternity among all citizens. This batch also has five fresh, young MPs (Sunil Bose, Priyanka Jharkiholi, Yaduveer Wadiyar and Shreyas Patel) who won on the strengths of their families’ caste, wealth and social standing in specific regions. Will these young representatives champion the needs of the new generation, advocating for open opportunities, equal rights and overarching democratic cultures? Or will they reproduce the culture of privilege and domination from which they emerged? At a time when the mixed mandate in Karnataka’s parliamentary election flags the possibility of challenging the intense saffronisation of society and state systems, we must repose on this new batch of parliamentarians a small glimmer of hope. If C N Manjunath was elected on the basis of recognising his healing touch, then one wishes that he will rise above the cultural politics of the BJP and emerge as a representative who fosters the healing of this deeply wounded society and state. It is only through this form of rapprochement and systemic accountability of elected representatives that we can address the possibilities of authoritarianism and forge new humane relations between citizens and their elected representatives.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : It is shameful that despite a decade of unhindered majority rule by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led NDA government at the Centre, India still has the highest number of malnourished children in the world, and we are nowhere near fulfilling Sustainable Development Goal number two, ‘Zero Hunger,’ by 2030. Despite being the fastest-growing major economy and having ambitions to become the world’s third-largest economy, India cannot provide enough nutrition to its youngest children. Could this be because of the misplaced priorities of Modi 1.0 and Modi 2.0? An important task for the new Union government is to make early childhood care and education (ECCE) a right for children below the age of six years. In 2002, the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) said that the proposed Article 21A, giving a fundamental right to education of children from six to 14 years, should be amended to include education of all children ‘up to the age of 14 years’, which would cover children from three to six years as well. It also recommended that after Article 24, Article 24-A be added to say, “Every child shall have the right to care and assistance in basic needs…”, which would include the provision of daycare, health, and nutrition to all children under the age of six years. The 2015 law commission report on ‘Early Childhood Development and Legal Entitlements’ pointed out that though India ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989, “the idea of justiciable rights for children, especially young children, has not yet taken shape”. Hence, it endorsed the NCRWC recommendations on Articles 21-A and 24-A. However, despite these recommendations, the Integrated Child Development Service (ICDS) does not place legal obligations on the executive or provide rights to young children and has ‘a fragmented approach based on targeted interventions.’ Amending the Constitution as recommended by the NCRWC may take time, especially with the new government finding its footing. With the Karnataka government setting up a commission in October to usher in a State Education Policy (SEP), a state-level law to make the ICDS a legal right is possible. Such a law is also a necessity in Karnataka today due to the confusion created by multiple agencies duplicating services for children. For instance, the Karnataka rural development and panchayat raj department has initiated ‘Koosina Mane’ (daycare centres), and the education department has started pre-primary sections for children in ‘Karnataka Public Schools’. Orders to start 1,008 pre-primary centres in the Kalyana Karnataka region were issued on June 11 — even before the SEP commission submits its recommendations. Though the intention of these departments is laudable, they have initiated the pre-school classes without consultation or convergence with the women and child development department, which oversees the ICDS. In a meeting chaired by the chief secretary on January 7, 2019, the women and child development department contended that other departments that were providing pre-primary education were duplicating the ICDS’ work and were not able to provide all the services given by the ICDS. Both the education and women and child development departments are yet to share with the State Cabinet their differing stands on the topic. Hence, as recommended by the law commission, the exclusive law for children under the age of six years needs to lay down that ‘the state should emerge as the primary duty-bearer’ under ‘a single institutional framework with a legislative foundation’, and multiple actors should not dilute this responsibility. It suggested ‘a statutory authority or Council for Early Childhood Development be created’. In Karnataka, it would also be desirable for the law to prescribe that all ECCE services be provided only under the women and child development department. This law is also necessary due to the current lack of standardisation of the norms, infrastructure, budgets, etc. for anganwadis. In April 2021, the High Court of Karnataka expressed shock at the status of infrastructure in anganwadis after the government admitted that of the 65,911 anganwadis, 21,686 had no toilets, only 33,146 had electricity, and only 29,560 had fans. Almost all anganwadis lacked separate areas for sleeping and playing and a separate kitchen and store room, as recommended by the Justice N K Patil Committee in April 2012. Despite this poor state of affairs, ICDS budgets have been continuously cut. It must be made a requirement under law that separate infrastructure be provided for children below three years and those between three and six years. Similarly, it must be made mandatory for the State to provide land, especially in urban areas, to construct anganwadis or improve their infrastructure. Daycare for children under six years should be a legal right and universalised; and pre-primary education for children in the age group of three to six years should be made a fundamental right. The required budget for fulfilling these goals would have to be mandatorily provided as a first charge on the resources and fixed within the law. The Anganwadi Workers’ Union has been agitating for years now to regularise their services. Considering the importance of their work and the additional working hours that will be required to provide daycare, anganwadi workers must be made government employees with proper wages, service conditions, including social security, etc. The pre-primary curriculum, the number of teachers and helpers required, their qualifications, and their regular training must be specified. The responsibilities of the grama panchayats and municipalities in ensuring the infrastructure and proper functioning of anganwadis and the composition and functioning of ECCE monitoring bodies, such as the balavikas samitis, at every anganwadi, block, taluk, and district levels will have to be prescribed. A system for licensing and regulating private daycare service providers will also have to be introduced. The enacting of such a law at the earliest, even at the national level, will ensure the development of India’s future generations. (The writer is executive trustee, CIVIC-Bangalore) #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : India Inc has assigned a value of $400 billion to the one-man, one-party rule of the Modi government on its third term. That is the total stock market value lost by BSE-listed stocks on the counting day of June 4, when the BJP, rather than securing a big majority, as projected by the exit polls, was found to just be able to form a coalition government. Once it was perceived that the Modi 3.0 coalition government could be as decisive as the earlier two versions, stock markets recovered their losses and even touched new highs within a span of eight trading days. On June 14, the Nifty 50 touched a new high of 23,490. So was the case with midcap and small cap indices. The Nifty Midcap 100 Index recovered from an intra-day low of 47,246 recorded on June 4 to close at a record high of 55,226 on June 14. The BJP’s two main coalition partners, the TDP and JD (U), are seen as being amenable to Modi’s vision for the Indian economy. The key ministries of finance, defence, commerce, home, and external affairs remain with the BJP, and the same ministers of the Modi 2.0 government will handle these ministries in 3.0 as well, bringing an element of stability and continuity to the policy framework. For now, it would be “business as usual,” said Bhaskar Chakravorti, dean of global business at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. It is clear that India Inc and stock market investors perceive the Modi 3.0 government as being pro-business, in spite of coalition constraints, if any. It was the Modi 2.0 government that drastically reduced the corporate tax rate from 30 per cent to 22 per cent in 2019–20. The Modi 2.0 government had also announced a lower rate of 15 per cent for newly incorporated domestic companies. It had also announced an outlay of Rs 1.97 lakh crore for the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes across 14 key sectors to create national manufacturing champions. Modi’s vision for India rests on the growth of a few giant companies, at the cost of the labour-intensive SME sector. “It would appear [Modi] has decided to back certain horses; these are the Hyundais, these are the Samsungs of India,” economist Swaminathan Aiyar was quoted by Financial Times in a recent article referring to the chaebol conglomerates that dominate South Korea’s economy. “He thinks these guys can do it.” The Modi government’s large spending on public infrastructure also augurs well for the corporate sector for better logistics and improved industrial demand, while the private sector sweats the existing capital with hardly any fresh investments in green field projects. While addressing a webinar hosted by DIPAM in 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the government has decided to monetize 100 PSUs valued at Rs 2.5 lakh crore. The government has “no business” to be in business, as the Prime Minister famously said. Private sector giants have an unsatiable hunger to grab valuable public assets in key sectors. Adani Group’s market cap has skyrocketed from $8.42 billion in 2014 to $43.99 billion as of June 2024, mainly powered by inorganic growth, the takeover of public assets, and entry into the government’s preferred sectors such as green energy, power, and ports. The Opposition’s criticism is that the tax burden has shifted from corporates to people, and the Modi government curtails public subsidies to finance the largesse given to the corporate sector. There has been no substantial reduction in personal income tax rates under the Modi regime. GST rates, which indirectly tax even the poorest of the poor, are high for many items. The Modi government has raised excise duties on petrol, diesel, and cooking gas. More money in the hands of the common man would have spurred consumption and stimulated private capital investment, which accounts for about 25 per cent of GDP. The economic policy of giving concessions to the corporate sector and squeezing the common people, the economic policy of nurturing large corporates and national champions at the cost of the SME sector, and the economic policy of growth without employment generation may be shortsighted. But these policies definitely boost corporate profits and stock prices in the short term. (The writer is a retired corporate professional) #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Life itself, particularly in its human form, is a wonder. Yet there are often times when people slip into existential angst. The purpose of life can become an anxiety. Is it elusive, does one need to seek it out or allow it to pass by? Even as this issue continues to occupy mind space, the traditional Hindu approach makes the task easier. When the purpose is split and spread out over a lifetime it is perhaps less daunting. Dharma, artha, kama and moksha give the fourfold purpose of life. Each in its own way is dynamic, flexible and ever changing, both for an individual and for society. Dharma is the idea of things as they ought to be. It is defined by societal norms, and as society changes it changes too. Sometimes the change is subtle, sometimes it is an act of law, and sometimes it works through strife. All mythologies reflect this in their characterisations and the strategies used for making adjustments. At the individual level, dharma sets out duties. Obeying the laws of the land, caring for infants and the aged, pursuing an occupation which enriches both the individual and society, are all part of dharma. Giving back to society is also an integral part. Care giving, developing a skill, and leading an ethical life are no mean purposes. Kama is the duty to procreate and appreciate the beauty and joys of life. This includes all social relationships, culture, refinements and celebrations. Finding the space to live the way one wants to live is a creative challenge. It can guide the choice of work, satisfaction and contentment. Artha, or material well-being, is the reaffirmation of action as the driving force of productivity. Creating wealth comes from action. The pressure can be viewed as an impetus to change. Satisfaction comes from the understanding that life has not one but many options. Moksha, or liberation, is an entirely voluntary choice. It is a process and completely flexible. To meditate, to be compassionate, to enjoy nature or to play with children, are all matters of choice. The equanimity achieved comes from what has been built up over time. Splitting up purpose makes life flow. The process is hopeful at every stage, and responsibilities discharged honourably mark a character. Coming to an understanding, accepting life with grace, and doing it without causing harm is perhaps as mindful as a life can hope to be. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : By Jeran Wittenstein Nvidia Corp. is the most expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, with its shares trading for roughly 23 times the company’s projected sales over the next 12 months. But there’s a problem with that valuation. In the age of the artificial intelligence boom, no one can figure out what the chipmaker’s revenues are actually going to be — not the Wall Street analysts covering Nvidia or Nvidia executives themselves. So how are investors supposed to calculate whether the shares are expensive or not? For more than a year now, a surge in demand for Nvidia’s chips sparked by the frenzy surrounding AI has made a mockery of Wall Street’s quarterly financial estimates. Analysts aren’t making up numbers, they take their cues from management like they do with every other company. However, even Nvidia’s leadership is struggling to anticipate how much money the chipmaker will generate three months into the future. Since Nvidia’s sales began exploding in its fiscal quarter that ended in April 2023, revenue has exceeded the midpoint of the company’s own forecast by an average of 13 per cent, more than twice the average over the past decade. When Nvidia reported results in August, sales topped its projection by 23 per cent, the biggest beat since at least 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia's price to projected sales is S&P 500's highest. Credit: Bloomberg Photo Ballparking sales Part of what makes modeling for Nvidia so difficult is that supply is the most uncertain variable when demand is booming, making the chipmaker unique, according to Brian Colello, an analyst at Morningstar, who last month raised his price target for the shares to $105 from $91. They’re currently trading at around $127. Assuming steady improvement in Nvidia’s ability to increase supply, Colello said he adds up to $4 billion to Nvidia’s quarterly revenue to ballpark the upcoming quarter’s sales. “I’m not the first analyst to be raising my price target or fair value or being surprised that revenues are far ahead of what we thought a year ago,” Colello said. “It’s been interesting and rewarding but certainly challenging.” Colello isn’t the only one raising his price estimate. On Friday, Melius analyst Ben Reitzes raised his price target on Nvidia for the fifth time this year, to $160 from $125, implying a gain of 26 per cent from Friday’s closing price. Of course, there are plenty of traders buying Nvidia solely based on momentum. Nvidia has gained 156 per cent this year and overtook Microsoft Corp. on Tuesday to briefly become the world’s most valuable company at $3.34 trillion. That rally helped drive a record $8.7 billion into tech funds last week through June 19, according to a Bank of America Corp.’s analysis of data from EPFR Global. Nvidia shares have since fallen 6.7 per cent, erasing more than $200 billion in market value. For investors inclined to stare at discounted cash flow models that have more variability than they have in the past, the gap between estimates and actual results has created a conundrum. In the past five quarters, analyst estimates for Nvidia’s sales have deviated from actual results by an average of 12 per cent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the third-most among the S&P 500 companies that have posted average quarterly revenue of at least $5 billion in the last five quarters and have at least 20 analysts covering them. Wall street having tough time forecasting. Credit: Bloomberg Photo What price? With Nvidia’s business booming and its biggest customers like Microsoft pledging to spend even more on computing hardware in coming quarters, the main question for investors is what’s a reasonable price to pay for a stock whose profit and sales growth is far superior to its megacap peers. Based on current estimates, Nvidia is projected to deliver profit of $14.7 billion on sales of $28.4 billion in the current quarter, up 137 per cent and 111 per cent, respectively, from the same period a year ago. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s sales are expected to rise 15 per cent with Apple projections sitting around 3 per cent. While Nvidia’s valuation multiples are rich, they look more reasonable given Nvidia’s growth, especially considering the estimates keep coming in low. To Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, a bigger concern is that the degree to which Nvidia surpasses Wall Street’s growth expectations will soon start subsiding, just due to the company’s sheer size. That could make it harder to justify the shares’ price tag. “That’s where the risk comes in,” O’Rourke said. “You’re paying a high price for a large market cap company where the beats have been trending lower and that’s likely to continue.” #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: I.N.D.I.A. bloc MPs gathered in the Parliament complex on Monday in a show of strength on the first day of the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha , holding copies of the Constitution and raising slogans on \"saving democracy\". Opposition leaders, including Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, party leader Rahul Gandhi, Trinamool Congress' Sudip Bandyopadhyay, DMK's TR Baalu, among others assembled at the spot where the Gandhi statue once stood in the Parliament complex. Former Congress president Sonia Gandhi also joined the MPs. Holding copies of the Constitution in their hands, they raised slogans such as \"long live Constitution\", \"we will save Constitution\", \"save our democracy\". Rahul Gandhi said they would not allow the Constitution to be \"attacked\" by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. \"This attack is not acceptable to us and that is why we held the Constitution and took oath,\" he said. \"Our message is reaching the public and no power can touch the Constitution of India and we will protect it,\" Gandhi added. Congress leader K C Venugopal said the I.N.D.I.A. bloc leaders entered the 18th Lok Sabha with Mahatma Gandhi's blessings. \"The I.N.D.I.A. alliance enters the 18th Lok Sabha with Bapu’s blessings and with a fresh resolve to give voice to people’s issues, challenges, hopes and aspirations in Parliament and keep the government in check every single minute,\" he said in a post on X. \"We are the guardians of democracy. We are committed to protecting and upholding the Constitution. We are united in our resolve to fight against injustice,\" Venugopal said. The Gandhi statue, which was a popular protest site for MPs, was recently relocated along with 14 other statues that dotted the complex to a new spot named Prerna Sthal. Several opposition parties have claimed that the mandate of 2024 Lok Sabha elections was against the ruling BJP, even though it was able to form the government with support of other parties. The I.N.D.I.A. bloc has also claimed that the results show that the people have backed the opposition parties to \"save the Constitution\". The first session of the 18th Lok Sabha began Monday morning. The newly elected members will be sworn in as members of the Lower House on Monday and Tuesday. The Lok Sabha Speaker will be elected on June 26 and President Droupadi Murmu's address to joint sitting of both the Houses is scheduled for June 27. The debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President's Address will begin on June 28. The prime minister is expected to respond to the debate on July 2 or 3. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Johannesburg: The African National Congress (ANC), which lost its 30-year-old parliamentary majority in last month's vote, must now share power for the first time since the end of white minority rule if it wants to continue governing South Africa . Having opted for a government of national unity over a traditional coalition formation, the party of the late Nelson Mandela is racing to cobble together a patchwork bloc made up of its erstwhile rivals. Here is a timeline of what to expect next: What's happening now? The ANC has until the first session of the new parliament, scheduled for Friday, June 14 to forge its new political alliances before lawmakers sit to choose a president, who is expected to be from the ANC as the largest party. Given its poor election performance, the ANC will need to bring in at least one large rival among its prospective partners. It is talking to parties spanning the political landscape, from the free-marketeer Democratic Alliance (DA) to the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). But major ideological differences and in some cases long-standing animosity are complicating matters. The DA, the largest opposition party, has said it won't join a formation with the EFF or former President Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) party, which came in a surprising third in last month's vote. The EFF has said it will not enter a government that includes the DA or the Freedom Front Plus - two parties that draw support from among South Africa's white minority. MK, in turn, has said it will not partner with the ANC if it is headed by President Cyril Ramaphosa, a rival of Zuma's who replaced him in 2018. The ANC says Ramaphosa's position is non-negotiable. Parliament convenes, elects President The 400-seat National Assembly will hold its first session on Friday where lawmakers will swear the oath of office before electing their speaker, deputy speaker and the country's president. Since the ANC fell short of a majority, having won 159 seats, it will need to draw upon the support of its new political allies to retain the presidency. Under South African law, candidates for president are nominated by members of parliament. If only one candidate is nominated, he or she is then elected. However, in the case of multiple candidates, lawmakers cast secret ballots with a candidate requiring support from a majority of members to be declared president. Zuma's MK party has applied to the country's top court to block parliament from sitting. Despite outperforming expectations and winning 55 seats, MK claims fraud marred the polls, which observers and the electoral commission said were free and fair. Inauguration of the President Following the first session of the National Assembly - usually within days - the newly elected president is sworn in at an inauguration ceremony. He or she will preside over the seventh administration since the end of apartheid and the advent of multi-racial democracy. Cabinet selection The negotiations to form the government of national unity will determine the composition of the executive branch, which is expected to undergo a major overhaul. Political parties will negotiate conditions, including preferred portfolios, positions and cabinet candidates, which the newly elected president will announce in the days following his or her inauguration. Key ministries such as finance, energy, foreign affairs and public enterprises are among the most coveted portfolios. Prior to the election, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, Minister in the Presidency Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Trade, Industry and Competition Minister Ebrahim Patel all indicated they planned to step down. South African law dictates that the president, who has the sole discretion to appoint the cabinet and deputy president, may select no more than two people from outside the National Assembly. Once the cabinet is announced, the president in conjunction with the speaker of the National Assembly and the chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, determines a date for the Opening of Parliament Address. This address outlines the new administration's governing priorities and marks the beginning of the new five-year parliamentary term. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Following the results of the EU elections, where he was beaten by Marine Le Pen's far-right party, the French President Emmanuel Macron took a gamble on his political future and called for new elections for the French National Assembly, dissolving the current one. Macron's call came as a shock to the French people , however, he rolled the dice in hopes of the French people 'waking-up to Le Pen's true face' and overturning his current lame-duck image in European politics. But how exactly do these elections work, who are the big players, and what Macron hope to gain through this snap election? The two national elections of France France holds two national elections for the general public to participate in - the Presidential election and the legislative elections. The French presidential election is a simple election of candidates. Usually, 2 rounds of voting is held. The first round sees voting between all candidates. Should a candidate achieve the majority, they are elected President immediately. If not, a second round is held between the two candidates with the highest vote percentage. The winner is elected president for a term of 5 years. The French legislative elections resemble the the system India uses. The election is between different parties, with each constituency in the country and its overseas territories electing a candidate to represent them in the French national assembly. 577 members are elected to the National Assembly. A party needs a majority of 289 to form the executive body and elect their prime minister. The elected representatives hold the position for a period of 5 years. Elections are held on Sundays in France, with campaigning stopped on Friday, and estimations of winners only allowed after voting is completed. Polling stations are open to any French citizen over the age of 18 and on the electoral roll. Who are the major players in France? In France, currently there are two major parties in the running, among others. The first is the ruling party, Renaissance(RE), or En Marche! as it was earlier known. The hold the majority in the National Assembly, France's lower house and the Senate, France's upper house, and also hold the Presidency, with Macron belonging to the party. They were the party who upset the two-party system of the left-aligned Socialist Party and and right-aligned Les Républicains in 2017, placing themselves as liberal centrists. In opposition is Marine Le Pen and her party, National Rally, a.k.a. Rassemblement National(RN). RN is a right wing populist party that recently gained a large number of seats in the 2024 EU elections. It was this victory, along with a several other factors over the past few years, that led Macron to dissolve the National Assembly in a bid to prevent the far-right from gaining power in 2027. French political parties have been rushing to try and find potential new alliances , though opinion polls show Marine Le Pen's far-right party is likely to win. What does Macron hope to gain? Macron's hope would be that the RN doesn't gain a majority and the rest of the parties ally with the RE to keep the right wing wave from reaching the French government. However, Macron risks a situation where he loses power over the legislative assembly. In usual circumstances, the majority party in the National Assembly is the same as the party the President belongs to. Thus, the President remains the decision maker while the Prime Minister becomes his deputy. Should RN reach majority, Macron will have to make way for the Prime Minister they elect and maintain an uncomfortable cohabitation situation till the Presidential elections in 2027. Victory for Macron will also overturn his currently unpopular image in Europe. It remains to be seen whether Macron's gamble has come at the right time for him, or if it is far too late to stop Marine Le Pen's right-wing revolution in France. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : The Bank of Japan may offer guidance on how it plans to reduce its $5-trillion balance sheet at its policy meeting on Friday, in a slow but steady retreat from its massive monetary stimulus. Below are possible ways the BOJ could move to quantitative tightening (QT), and scale back a balance sheet that has ballooned to nearly 1.3 times the size of Japan's economy after years of aggressive monetary easing. What is the BOJ's current plan? Since ending negative interest rates and bond yield control in March, the BOJ has pledged to keep buying roughly 6 trillion yen ($38 billion) of government bonds per month to avoid the policy shift from causing an abrupt spike in bond yields. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has said the bank will eventually reduce bond purchases, but offered no clues on the timing. The topic was discussed by the board in April with some members calling for the need to reduce the bank's balance sheet including by slowing monthly bond buying, or lay out a plan at some point in the future. What could the BOJ decide on Friday? Sources have told Reuters the BOJ will discuss whether to taper, but that the decision would depend on market developments leading up to the meeting, including moves after the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Wednesday. With Japanese bond yields stable and the yen remaining on a weak note, the BOJ may decide to trim monthly purchases slightly from 6 trillion yen or lower the range at which it buys each month. But given some board members are opposed to an early taper, the central bank may instead decide to offer only vague language committing to reducing future bond buying. Such pledges may be included in the BOJ's policy statement or made in comments from Ueda at his post-meeting briefing. What's at stake? With inflation exceeding its 2% target, the BOJ plans to raise short-term interest rates steadily to levels that neither cool nor overheat the economy - seen by analysts as being anywhere between 1-2%. That means hiking rates several times in coming years from the current range of 0-0.1%. During the process, the BOJ must start reducing its huge balance sheet, which it estimates as pushing down long-term borrowing costs by around 1%, to ensure future rate hikes are effective in scaling back the degree of monetary support. The BOJ has a long way to go. At 125% times Japan's gross domestic product (GDP), its balance sheet is five times the Fed's in ratio-to-GDP terms. That means it needs to start tapering fairly soon, analysts say. What are the risks? Japan's dire fiscal situation means the BOJ must avoid causing sharp yield spikes that would boost the cost of funding the country's huge public debt. Years of heavy-handed intervention by the BOJ has made bond market participants accustomed to its huge presence, which means even slight signs of tapering could destabilise markets. As such, the BOJ won't follow the Fed, which scaled back its balance sheet under a fixed, pre-determined schedule from a peak of nearly $9 trillion yen to $7.4 trillion as of March. Instead, the BOJ will keep indicating how much bonds it will buy on a monthly basis and reassure markets that any tapering will be gradual. It will also maintain a pledge to intervene in the market if yield rises are too sharp. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Bonn: Nearly 200 countries will try to agree a new global goal for funding to fight climate change at this year's UN COP29 climate summit in November in Baku, Azerbaijan. Preparatory talks among countries' climate negotiators, due to finish on Thursday in Bonn, Germany, have laid bare the rifts between governments over who should pay, and how much. Here's where things stand. Climate finance is money that large economies provide to help poorer countries invest in projects to curb greenhouse gas emissions, and cope with the worsening extreme weather unleashed by climate change. In 2009, developed countries agreed that from 2020 to 2025 they would transfer $100 billion a year in such funds. The task for negotiators in this year's UN climate talks is to set a new goal to replace the $100 billion from 2025. Worsening climate change and lagging clean energy investments in developing nations mean estimates for the funds needed have ballooned in size since countries agreed the first climate finance goal. The UN points to an independent report from 2023 which estimated $2.4 trillion of investments per year are needed by 2030 in developing countries - excluding China - to meet climate goals and protect their societies from extreme weather. That would be a four-fold increase from current levels. It includes public finance, as well as private finance and funding from sources including development banks. Ahead of COP29, some countries have proposed numbers for the new goal. The Arab group of countries, which includes Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt, suggest a UN target of $1.1 trillion per year, with $441 billion coming directly from developed country governments in grants. India, African countries and small island nations have also said more than $1 trillion should be raised per year, but with mixed views on how much of this should come from government coffers. Discussions are circling around the idea of a two-layer goal: combining a bigger outer goal that includes all global climate finance - from development bank loans, to private funding - and a smaller, core target for public money from wealthy countries' governments. The developed countries expected to take the lead in providing the funding have yet to suggest a number they would accept, although the US and EU each say the new goal must exceed the previous $100 billion target. Currently, only a few dozen wealthy countries are obliged to provide climate finance. That list of financing nations was decided during UN climate talks in 1992, and hasn't been changed since. The EU and US say that list is outdated, and want to add a new donors including China, the world's second-biggest economy, and countries with high GDP per capita, such as Qatar, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. Beijing has firmly opposed this. The question of which countries must pay is expected to be a core issue at COP29. UN climate talks take decisions by consensus, meaning none of the nearly 200 countries involved can oppose a deal. Today, most public climate finance is loans, with a smaller share of grants, OECD data show. Other types of funding counted include private finance mobilised by governments, export credits, and support from development banks. Some countries suggest defining what climate finance is not. Loans provided at market rates, export credits - neither of these should count, negotiators from small island countries have argued in Bonn this week, citing concerns that climate funding offered as loans is pushing poorer nations further into debt. Countries in Bonn also discussed whether commitments to cut fossil fuel subsidies could be reflected in the climate finance goal - a proposal resisted by oil and gas producers including Oman. With public budgets stretched, countries are hunting for new sources of funding. Ideas set to be discussed at COP29 include taxes on the fossil fuel and defence sectors, and debt swaps where part of a country's debt is forgiven, in exchange for the country investing more in addressing climate change. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : By William Horobin, Michelle Jamrisko, Josh Wingrove and Tom Rees It’s been a decade since the Group of Seven kicked Russia out. Now the club accounting for 44 per cent of the global economy has come to terms with its limitations while embracing its resilience. Their counterweight — an axis of resistance led by China and Russia — is trying to force countries in the loosely-defined Global South to pick sides and tip the balance of power. The G7 response, at a summit this week in Southern Italy, is to craft a creative and exquisitely political solution on how to use the interest from Russian frozen assets to support Ukraine. Its weakness is that several of the leaders landing in Italy are in dire straits back home. US President Joe Biden is behind Donald Trump in many polls ahead of November elections. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is on track for defeat in July. France’s Emmanuel Macron is batting away rumors he’d quit in a snap legislative election he didn’t need to call next month. Faced with two brutal wars, can the G7 muster enough economic, military and persuasive power to stave off the biggest threats to the democratic-led global order since World War II? The battle lines of this new era of geo-economic fragmentation are drawn. No issue illustrates the G7’s isolation better than Ukraine. The group and the European Union have provided the vast majority of aid and foreign military support — while nearly every other nation has mostly avoided the fray or even aligned with Russia. The Ukraine conflict combined with China’s military build-up has raised doubts about G7 military dominance, including whether the US would conceivably be able to both help defend Ukraine, while also responding to any invasion of Taiwan. While Russian defence spending has spiked, the G7’s remains stable — including several countries that are under the 2 per cent of GDP target set for NATO members, a key gripe of Trump. Of course, Russia's smaller economy means that even the doubling of spending as a share of GDP due to the war is roughly the same amount in money terms as the much more modest increase that Germany has planned, according to Bloomberg Economics. For the G7, defending Ukraine is a matter of principle and a defence of democracy itself. For many other nations, it’s just another sign of a multipolar world and the loosening reach of the West. Sanctions initially united the G7 around severing their bilateral trade with Russia, but diverting goods through third countries still allows Moscow to wage war. Germany’s exports to Kazakhstan, for instance, have jumped since Russia’s February 2022 invasion. Also, China has filled in the gaps Russia needs by boosting their bilateral trade. The US this week moved to curb reselling of goods to Russia, widening enforcement on chips made and sold abroad. “On both counts – China and trade diversion via third countries – there’s a big problem,” said Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “Russia isn’t economically isolated.” Over the past 10 years, the world’s center of economic gravity has shifted further away from the West and will likely flip sides before the end of the next decade. The G7 economies are on track to be eclipsed by the rest of the G-20 in terms of gross domestic product by 2030, according to a Bloomberg analysis of World Bank data. Part of the G7’s problem: a malaise since the global financial crisis, marked by stagnant living standards, woeful productivity gains and a shift down in growth rates amid soaring public debt. At the same time, their populations are aging faster than counterparts in the G-20: Half of India’s 1.4 billion population is younger than 30 years old, while about one-fifth of people in the G7 are currently over 65. The aging workforces cloud longer-term fiscal outlooks and leave the world’s richest economies with little capacity to absorb the next shock. Of the seven, only Germany has a lower debt level than 10 years ago, and most are expected to keep piling on borrowing rather than build buffers in the coming years. Meanwhile, Asian economies have enjoyed rapid growth, fueled by an expanding population, globalization and an emerging middle class. “For China in particular, and for other large, fast-growing emerging markets such as India, this expanding economic power is a necessary pre-condition for their increasing geopolitical clout,” said Ben Bland, director of the Asia-Pacific program at Chatham House. Coming out of the Second World War, free trade was seen as the path to prosperity. Now the focus is on economic statecraft. That involves intervention in markets and protectionist industrial policies that feel increasingly like war by other means. Industrial policies — whether they consist of government subsidies, tax breaks or other incentives — have moved from being maligned by the West to becoming the mainstream in Washington, and the subject of growing interest in Brussels. Once a vocal critic of the US’s Inflation Reduction Act, the European Union is debating its own industrial protections because, as former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi put it this year, “other regions are no longer playing by the rules.” The bloc plans to raise levies on Chinese electric vehicles starting next month, escalating trade tensions further. Perhaps uniting around such worries, G7 finance chiefs preparing for this week’s leaders’ summit marked the change in strategy by singling out China in their communiqué and promising to consider measures to ensure a level playing field. Many steps have already been taken unilaterally, with the G7 meeting coming shortly after the Biden administration’s announcement to reimpose tariffs on hundreds of goods imported from China. The EU, meanwhile, is set to announce results of a probe into Chinese subsidies for EVs that could also lead to tariffs. Even if there's some unity within the G7 about deploying these economic tools against China, it’s not lost on Beijing that the emphasis is on punishing competitors — not rewarding friends. Everyone is acutely aware that so-called carrots as well as sticks will need to be wielded to bring the Global South onside. For all its challenges, the bloc remains one of the few international groupings that can mount the kind of massive financial response that’s helped Ukraine fight Russia’s invasion or aspire to set the agenda on major global issues. “There’s no multilateral grouping that’s been effective as the G7 across multiple fronts,” said Caitlin Welsh, a former US official now with the Center for Strategic & International Studies in Washington. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Berlin/Warsaw/Madrid: From Germany and France to Poland and Spain, the far-right made inroads into the youth vote in key states in this EU election - as a generation that has grown up amid constant crises seeks new answers and follows politicians fluent in TikTok and YouTube. Young voters, traditionally perceived to be more left-wing, drove the wave of support for environmental parties at the last EU election in 2019, earning the nickname \"Generation Greta\" after the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. But following the pandemic, the Ukraine war and cost of living crisis, many shifted their support this year towards far-right populist parties that tapped into their concerns, fuelling their overall rise in the June 6-9 EU parliament poll. With the leaders of Europe's often upstart ethno-nationalist, anti-establishment movements mastering new social media better than their mainstream counterparts, they are earning cachet as a subversive counterculture among some young people. They appeal in particular to young men who feel left behind and censored by an increasingly \"woke\" mainstream, analysts say. \"Germany is not going in a good direction and they were the only party with a really clear message, on migration,\" said Christoph, 17, a trade school student in Berlin who declined to give his full name, who voted for the far-right Alternative for Germany. Support for the AfD, which wants to curb migration and warns against what it calls the Islamisation of Germany, was up 11 percentage points to 16% among under-25 year olds, according to an exit poll by Infratest dimap - more than double the 5-point rise among the broader population. The shift, which helped the AfD achieve a historic second place nationwide, was notable in that Germany's decision to allow 16-18 year-olds to vote for the first time had been expected to favour left-leaning parties. Though the far-right did not do well everywhere among young voters - and they are a relatively small category in a continent with an ageing population - the trend will still worry mainstream parties, who face a snap election later this month in France, and federal elections next year in Germany. A recent survey of Germany's youth showed that young people were increasingly worried about inflation, expensive housing and social divisions, and less about climate change. The Greens won just 11 per cent of the youth vote on Sunday, down 23 percentage points. \"There is no longer a sense that if they just work hard then the future will be better, and they are disappointed by the parties in power,\" said study lead author Simon Schnetzer, noting that economic gloom was making them more receptive to the AfD's anti-migration rhetoric. Christoph said his experiences led him to believe Germany's more recent immigrants were more prone to violence and unwilling to integrate. In France, the far-right National Rally (RN) took a 25 per cent share of the vote among 18-24 year olds, according to pollster Ipsos, up 10 percentage points compared with an around 8-point gain overall to 31.4 per cent. To be sure, most of the youth in the EU's two top powers still back leftist parties, and many worry about the latest trend. \"It worries me because I saw the far-right wants to deport people even if they have German citizenship like me,\" said Ensar Adanur, 17, a German of Turkish origin. \"But Germany is home for me.\" In Poland, however, support for the far-right Confederation among 18-29 years old voters increased from 18.5 per cent to 30.1 per cent, making them the leading choice for that demographic. Mainstream parties \"no longer have any credibility for me, the previous government and the current one show it clearly\", said Paweł Rurkowski, 30, an IT specialist who voted for the Confederation. Far-right parties' relative proficiency in young voters' preferred channels of communication - video apps such as Tiktok and YouTube and messaging app Telegram - is a big factor behind their increasing success with that generation, analysts said. The recent German youth study showed that 57 per cent of young people get their news and politics through social media. But German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, like many mainstream politicians, only joined Tiktok a few months ago. \"If you are not on young peoples' channels, you simply do not exist,\" said Schnetzer. Meanwhile social media platforms algorithms favour controversial messages that generate engagement over serious content, said Ruediger Maas, founder of the Institute for Generational Research in Augsburg. The AfD's lead candidate for the EU elections, Maximilian Krah, went viral on TikTok, for example, with dating tips for young men: \"Don't watch porn, don't vote for the Greens, go out into the fresh air ... Real men are right-wing.\" He has some 53,300 followers on Tiktok, compared with just 11,000 and 2,652 respectively for the lead candidates for the centre-left Social Democrats and the Greens. \"My generation doesn't really know about politics but we hear about the AfD all the time,\" said AfD voter Christoph. In Spain, social media influencer Alvise Perez clinched 6.7 per cent of the youth vote, compared with 4.6 per cent of the overall vote, after conducting his anti-immigration and anti-corruption maverick campaign almost exclusively on Instagram and Telegram. Far-right party Vox, meanwhile, which was strong on Tiktok, garnered 12.4 per cent of the vote among those under 25, compared with 9.6 per cent overall. \"It seems to be the only party that really opposes the government when it comes to taboo subjects such as immigration or gender discourse,\" said Xavier, a 22-year-old university student who cast his vote for Vox. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Kyiv: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he will sign bilateral security agreements with the United States and Japan on the sidelines of the Group of Seven Summit in Italy on Thursday. The two countries are set to be the last two G7 nations to sign such deals. Fifteen countries have already signed such deals on security cooperation, pledging to keep up their long-term support in the 27-month-old, full-scale war with Russia. The Group of Seven wealthy nations signed a joint declaration at the NATO summit in Vilnius in July last year committing to establish \"long-term security commitments and arrangements\" that would be negotiated with Ukraine bilaterally. The deals, it said, would promise continued provision of military and security aid, support to develop Ukraine's defence industrial base, training Ukrainian soldiers, intelligence-sharing and cooperation, and support for cyber defence. The sides would also immediately hold consultations with Kyiv to determine \"appropriate next steps\" in the event of a \"future Russian armed attack\". More than 30 countries have since signed the declaration. Kyiv says the arrangements should contain important and concrete security commitments, but that the agreements would in no way to replace its strategic goal of joining NATO. The Western alliance regards any attack launched on one of its 32 members as an attack on all under its Article Five clause. \"There has been speculation that by concluding enough of these agreements, we do not need membership. False. We need NATO membership,\" said Ihor Zhovkva, the Ukrainian president's foreign affairs adviser. Britain in January became the first country to sign one of the security agreements with Ukraine for a term of 10 years, by which time Kyiv hopes to be inside NATO. London said the deal formalised a range of support that it \"has been and will continue to provide for Ukraine's security, including intelligence-sharing, cyber security, medical and military training, and defence industrial cooperation\". Germany and France were next to sign the documents, followed by Denmark, Canada, Italy, Netherlands, Finland, Latvia, Spain, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, Norway and Iceland. Ukraine's Zhovkva singled out as \"very important\" the provision in the British deal under which consultations could be held within 24 hours to provide swift and sustained aid. This, he said, went beyond the \"infamous\" 1994 Budapest Memorandum under which Ukraine was provided with security \"assurances\" by Britain, Russia and the United States in return for relinquishing nuclear weapons from its territory. \"We do not want to repeat the infamous experience of the Budapest declaration, which remained just a declaration,\" he said. Zhovkva said there was no need for Ukraine to rush to agree deals. \"I don't need 10 or 15 agreements concluded within one week. Rather, I would have this same 10 or 15 agreements deeply thought over, well-negotiated and with concrete signs of long-term and varied support for Ukraine.\" #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Seoul: Russian President Vladimir Putin may visit Pyongyang for meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as soon as next week, South Korean officials say. Here's how North Korea-Russia relations began, and how the two countries' ties have warmed in recent years. What is the history behind their ties? As Russia's isolation from the West over its war in Ukraine has grown, analysts say it has seen increasing value in North Korea. For North Korea's part, relations with Russia haven't always been as warm as they were during at the height of the Soviet Union, but now the country is reaping clear benefits from Moscow's need for friends. Communist North Korea was formed in the early days of the Cold War with the backing of the Soviet Union. North Korea later battled the South and its US and United Nations allies to a stalemate in the 1950-1953 Korean War with extensive aid from China and the Soviet Union. North Korea was heavily reliant on Soviet aid for decades, and the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s contributed to a famine in the North. Pyongyang's leaders have often tried to use Beijing and Moscow to balance each other. Kim, who came to power in 2011, initially had a relatively cool relationship with Russia and China, which both joined the United States in imposing strict sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear tests. Russia has since joined China in opposing new sanctions on North Korea, blocking a US-led push and publicly splitting the UN Security Council on the issue for the first time since it started punishing Pyongyang in 2006. In March, Russia blocked the annual renewal of a panel of experts monitoring enforcement of longstanding UN sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes. How are Russia and North Korea interacting? After his country's most recent nuclear test in 2017, Kim took steps to repair ties and he met Putin in 2019 for the first time in the Russian city of Vladivostok. In September last year, Putin welcomed Kim to the Vostochny space launch facility in Russia's far east and promised to help North Korea build satellites, among other vows of cooperation and support. Underlining the deepening ties, then Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu visited Pyongyang in July 2023 and toured a weapons exhibit that included the North's banned ballistic missiles. He later stood beside Kim and saluted those missiles as they rolled by during a military parade. Since Kim and Putin met last year there has been a steady stream of delegations between the two countries on everything from forestry and agriculture to zoos and culture. How has the Ukraine war affected the relationship? North Korea has reciprocated with public support for Moscow after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It was one of the only countries to recognise the independence of Russian-claimed Ukrainian regions, and it expressed support for Russia's annexation of parts of Ukraine. The U.S. and others have accused North Korea of transferring weapons to Russia for use against Ukraine. The debris from a missile that landed in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Jan. 2 was from a North Korean Hwasong-11 series ballistic missile launched from Russian territory, UN sanctions monitors told a Security Council committee in a report seen by Reuters . Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the accusations, but vowed last year to deepen military relations. Shoigu told Russian media last year that Moscow was discussing holding joint military exercises with North Korea. \"Why not, these are our neighbours. There's an old Russian saying: you don't choose your neighbours and it's better to live with your neighbours in peace and harmony,\" Interfax news agency quoted him as saying. What are the economic ties? In 2022 Russia and North Korea restarted train travel for the first time since railway journeys were cut during the Covid pandemic. The train carried an unusually opulent cargo: 30 thoroughbred horses. Shortly after that, Russia resumed oil exports to North Korea, UN data shows, the first such shipments reported since 2020. The vast majority of North Korea's trade goes through China, but Russia is a potentially important partner as well, particularly for oil, experts said. Moscow has denied breaking UN sanctions on oil exports to Pyongyang, but Russian tankers have been accused of helping evade caps on exporting oil to North Korea. Russian officials have openly discussed \"working on political arrangements\" to employ 20,000 to 50,000 North Korean labourers, despite UN Security Council resolutions that ban such arrangements. Russian officials and leaders in occupied regions of Ukraine have also discussed the possibility of having North Korean workers help rebuild war-torn areas. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Seoul: Pop star Ariana Grande is joining Weverse, a superfan platform owned by HYBE, an entertainment firm that manages K-Pop phenomenon BTS. Here is what we know about Weverse and why more pop stars around the world are joining the app. What is the Weverse app? Weverse is an app that specialises in interaction between artists and fans. Artists on the app write posts, livestream and sell merchandise. HYBE described Weverse as a 'super app' that also offers machine translation in 15 languages. When Jin, the oldest member of BTS, spoke to fans on Wednesday after finishing his 18-month-long military duty, his initial livestream crashed before resuming and racking up more than 2 million views in 10 minutes. Released in 2019, the app had more than 10 million monthly active users on average in the third quarter of 2023, according to HYBE. Nine of 10 Weverse users are international. Why is Ariana Grande joining Weverse? Grande will join the app after signing a partnership with HYBE America, the entertainment firm said on Friday, without providing further details. Her channel is yet to launch, and HYBE declined to confirm the opening date. HYBE America, which also manages Justin Bieber and The Kid LAROI, will also continue cooperation with Grande's cosmetics brand R.E.M Beauty, the company added. The new partnership comes after Billboard reported last year that Grande was parting ways with manager Scooter Braun, who she had been with since her debut in 2013. Braun is now the CEO of HYBE America after a $1.05 billion merger deal in 2021 between HYBE and the music executive's Ithaca Holdings. The announcement of Grande's partnership was met with amusement from K-Pop fans online. \"Ariana unnie\" one fan said on X, referring to her with a Korean honorific for older sister. Japanese pop duo Yoasobi, who attended a state dinner at the White House with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in April, also opened their channel on Weverse earlier this month. What does HYBE seek to gain? In a 2022 interview, Weverse President Joon Choi told Reuters that the platform's users are \"superfans characterised by passionate engagement.\" \"They bought merch here, watched videos there, communicated elsewhere ... We didn't have a database of our customers. So, we began developing each service in-house,\" he said in the interview. The app's growth comes against the backdrop of HYBE's efforts to expand as a label including its acquisition of Exile Music, a music label of Spanish language media company Exile Content, in its first major foray into the Latin music market. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Last week the National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) granted a 60-day extension to the grounded airline Go First to complete its insolvency process. It was the fourth time it was doing so. In this issue of DH Deciphers , Abhilash Reddy , unpacks why the matter is dragging and how it got here. How long has the Go First insolvency process been going on? NCLT admitted Go First’s insolvency plea last year on May 10. But more than a year later, the case is still nowhere near resolution. The airline was granted its first extension on November 23, when the 180-day timeline for completing the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) expired. The second extension happened on February 13 this year when April 4 was set as the deadline. The third extension was granted on April 8, which ended on June 3. What was the reason given this time for seeking extension yet again? Struggling to find a buyer the airline and also the assigned Resolution Professional (RP) bore the brunt of the ire of the two-member NCLT bench, which pronounced that this was the last extension being granted. Seeking the extension it was argued that the situation had altered with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) deregistering the airline’s 54 aircraft at the behest of the Delhi High Court (HC), enabling lessors to reclaim their aircraft. With the RP not challenging the Delhi HC order as yet, prospective buyers have revised their offers, with one of them (EaseMyTrip’s CEO Nishant Pitti) even withdrawing his offer. Now, the lenders do not find the revised offers palatable. More time has been sought to extricate the airline from this fix. Who are the suitors still in the fray? SpiceJet's Ajay Singh and Sharjah-based aircraft lessor SkyOne FZE, which has not so long ago set up shop at Gujarat’s GIFT city, are the remaining contenders today. The backstory on how Go First went bankrupt The airline has blamed its downfall squarely on the malfunctioning of the Pratt & Whitney engines that left most of its A320neo fleet grounded, which had the company grappling with loss in revenue and other additional expenses to the tune Rs 10,800 crore. News reports at the time of its filing for insolvency pegged the airline’s total debt at Rs 11,463 crore. How did Go First’s exit impact Indian aviation market? According to DGCA data, Go First had a market share of 7-10% in terms of passengers carried. Its exit at a time when Indian air traffic was soaring, inevitably put pressure on the Indian airlines remaining, with SpicJet operation too doddering for a while. As Indigo and Air India, which have a market share of 80% with the remaining 20% divided among the smaller players, took on the added load, air fares started soaring. Such was the price rise that the Civil Aviation Minister felt compelled to intervene at one point. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Johannesburg: Cyril Ramaphosa was re-elected as South Africa 's president on Friday with the support of once rival parties that have agreed to join his African National Congress (ANC) in a new government of national unity. The ANC - which was forced to share power for the first time in 30 years after losing its majority in last month's vote - still has to work out how to divide up the top cabinet jobs and overcome ideological differences with its new partners. Here is what has happened and what to expect next: What has happened? Just a few hours after the first session of the new parliament got underway on Friday, the white-led, pro-business Democratic Alliance (DA) announced it would co-govern with the ANC \"in a spirit of unity and collaboration\". Two smaller parties, the socially conservative Inkatha Freedom Party and the right-wing Patriotic Alliance, are also part of the pact. The Marxist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party said it will not be part of a government that includes the DA or the Freedom Front Plus - two parties that draw support from the white minority. The uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) party, led by former President Jacob Zuma, is also not part of the unity government. MK, which came in a surprising third in last month's vote, has said it will join an alliance of smaller opposition parties in parliament called the \"Progressive Caucus\", which includes the EFF and the centre-left United Democratic Movement. This alliance will be the official opposition to the coalition government. Parliament elects president On Friday, lawmakers took their oaths of office at the first session of the 400-seat National Assembly since the May 29 vote, then elected the ANC's Thoko Didiza as speaker and DA member Annelie Lotriet as deputy speaker. Ramaphosa was elected by lawmakers for a second term in office. He was going against EFF leader Julius Malema. Since the ANC fell short of a majority, Ramaphosa drew upon the support of his new political allies to retain the presidency. Under South African law, candidates for president, speaker and deputy speaker of the National Assembly are nominated by members of parliament. If only one candidate is nominated, he or she is then elected. In the case of multiple candidates, lawmakers cast secret ballots with a candidate requiring support from a majority of members to be declared the winner. Inauguration of the president Ramaphosa will be sworn in at an inauguration ceremony on Wednesday, June 19. He will preside over the seventh administration since the end of apartheid and the advent of multi-racial democracy. Cabinet selection The negotiations between the parties in the unity government will determine the composition of the executive branch, which is expected to undergo a major overhaul. Political parties will negotiate conditions, including preferred portfolios, positions and cabinet candidates, which the newly elected president will announce in the days following his inauguration. Key ministries such as finance, energy, foreign affairs and public enterprises are among the most coveted portfolios. Prior to the election, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, Minister in the Presidency Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Trade, Industry and Competition Minister Ebrahim Patel all indicated they planned to step down. South African law dictates that the president, who has the sole discretion to appoint the cabinet and deputy president, may select no more than two people from outside the National Assembly. Once the cabinet is announced, Ramaphosa in conjunction with the speaker of the National Assembly and the chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, determines a date for the Opening of Parliament Address. This address outlines the new administration's governing priorities and marks the beginning of the new five-year parliamentary term. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : President Vladimir Putin of Russia will travel to North Korea for a two-day visit starting Tuesday to meet with one of the main arms suppliers for his war against Ukraine. As the war has dragged on, Russia has found itself in dire need of conventional weapons, including artillery shells, that North Korea could supply. Here’s some background on what has happened so far and why it matters. What do we know about earlier arms shipments? The United States first accused North Korea of selling artillery to Russia as far back as September 2022, seven months after the war started. At the time, North Korea denied the accusations. Then, in August, the White House warned that Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un were conducting arms negotiations, and in September, Kim visited Putin in eastern Russia. Just weeks later, U.S. officials said that North Korea had shipped more than 1,000 containers of arms to Russia for use in the war in Ukraine. By March, officials said, North Korea had sent close to 7,000 containers of weapons to Russia. If filled with 152 mm artillery shells, the containers could carry as many as 3 million rounds, South Korea’s defense minister said. Or, if filled with 122 mm rockets, they could hold more than 500,000 rounds. They could also have held a mix of both weapons, he said. In his latest estimate, the minister, Shin Wok-sik, last week put the number of North Korea shipping containers sent to Russia at 10,000. Additionally, the White House said in January that Russia had begun launching ballistic missiles produced in North Korea. Arms control experts said that fragments of the short-range Hwasong-11A ballistic missile have been found in the aftermath of Russian airstrikes on Ukrainian cities for months, including in Kharkiv in February. North Korea may also be supplying anti-tank missiles, and portable surface-to-air missiles, as well as rifles, rocket launchers, mortars and shells, South Korean military officials told journalists in November. How important are these weapons? The war in Ukraine is a war of attrition, with Russia and Ukraine trying to outgun each other, firing thousands of artillery shells, missiles and rockets every day. That means that all of the munitions that North Korea gives helps Russia maintain an edge over Ukraine. The Hwasong-11A series missiles, in particular, have a high degree of precision and are difficult to shoot down, experts have said. But at least some of the other weapons are thought to be old or otherwise somewhat ineffective. Last fall, the top U.S. military official at the time, Gen. Mark Milley, said he doubted it would be “decisive” when asked if 152 mm rounds provided by North Korea would have a big impact on the battlefield. “Would it have a huge difference? I’m skeptical of that,” he said shortly before stepping down as chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Bangkok: Thailand weathered a critical day of court cases on Tuesday, including those involving the fate of the prime minister and the main opposition, dodging an immediate political crisis in Southeast Asia's second-largest economy. Four cases before the courts involved the country's most powerful politicians: Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, former prime leader Thaksin Shinawatra, the popular opposition Move Forward party and upper-house lawmakers. For decades, Thailand's politics has been shaped by a struggle between its conservative-royalist establishment, supported by the military, and populist parties such as those backed by Thaksin and the current opposition Move Forward party. \"These cases highlight the fragility and complexity of Thailand's political climate,\" ANZ Research said in a note. \"On the economic front, the immediate concerns are the potential for disruptive protests and delays to fiscal policy implementation.\" How is the Prime Minister involved? Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, a political novice who took office last August, has been accused by a group of conservative senators of breaching the constitution when he appointed a former lawyer with a conviction record to his cabinet. Srettha, who denies any wrongdoing, could face dismissal if the Constitutional Court rules against him. If Srettha is removed from office, a new government must be formed and his ruling Pheu Thai party would need to put forward a new candidate for premier to be voted on by parliament. The court said on Tuesday that the next hearing in the case will be held on July 10. What is the case against Thaksin? Thaksin, the influential former premier who was ousted in a 2006 military coup, was formally indicted in a criminal court in Bangkok for allegedly insulting the royalty and other charges linked to a 2015 media interview on Tuesday. A criminal court subsequently granted bail to the billionaire politician, who has said he is innocent, and instructed Thaksin to appear at an evidence review and hearing on August 19. \"He did not commit any wrongdoing,\" Thaksin's lawyer Winyat Chatmontre told reporters on Tuesday. Thailand's lese-majeste law, one of the world's toughest, carries a maximum jail sentence of up to 15 years for each perceived royal insult. The 74-year-old returned to Thailand to a rock star's reception last August after 15 years of self-imposed exile. Hours after his arrival, Shinawatra family-backed Pheu Thai and Srettha sailed through a parliamentary vote to pick the prime minister, fuelling speculation that Thaksin had struck a deal with his former enemies in the conservative establishment. Thaksin and the Pheu Thai party have denied this. Is the opposition under threat? Another case could lead to the dissolution of the progressive Move Forward party, which has 30 per cent of seats in the lower house after winning last year's closely-fought election but was blocked by conservative lawmakers from forming a government. The dissolution of Move Forward's predecessor party, Future Forward, in 2020 over a campaign funding violation was among the factors that triggered massive anti-government street protests. The Constitutional Court is considering an Election Commission complaint that alleges the Move Forward party breached the constitution with an election campaign to reform the country's royal insult law. Move Forward, which denies any wrongdoing, ceased efforts to change the law following a January verdict from the same court that ruled the party's plan to amend the law was a hidden effort to undermine the monarchy. The court set the next hearing for the case on July 3. What about the senate election? The Constitutional Court also delivered a verdict on Tuesday on the ongoing selection of a new 200-member Senate, saying the complex, three-tier process was lawful. If the process had been cancelled or delayed, it would have temporarily extend the term of military-appointed lawmakers who have been central in determining government formation, including last year's manoeuvre to block Move Forward from forming a government. The current upper house was hand-picked by the military following a 2014 coup that ousted an elected Pheu Thai government that had been led by Thaksin's sister, who still lives in self-imposed exile. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Beijing: During a visit to Australia this week, Chinese Premier Li Qiang made a classic goodwill gesture that boded well for relations between the two countries: he offered to send pandas. The offer comes as ties between Australia and its largest trading partner improve after a diplomatic dispute that lead to China imposing a raft of restrictions on Australian agricultural and mineral exports in 2020. Native to China, pandas have through the years become \"envoys of friendship\", earning China's outreach to countries it gifts the animals to the name of panda diplomacy . They have also been used to show Chinese anger. So what is panda diplomacy and how does it work? Since its founding in 1949, the People's Republic of China has used panda diplomacy to boost its international image, either by gifting or lending panda to foreign zoos as goodwill animal ambassadors. Former Chinese leader Mao Zedong in 1957 gifted a panda, Ping Ping, to the former Soviet Union to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution that ushered in the Soviet regime. To further cement ties with its socialist allies, China dispatched another panda to the Soviet Union in 1959 and five more to North Korea between 1965 and 1980. In 1972, Beijing gifted two pandas, Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing, to the United States after then President Richard Nixon's historic visit, in a sign of normalised China-US relations and marking a pivotal moment for China's foreign policy. Since then, other countries including Japan, France, Britain and Spain have also been given panda. Since 1984, China stopped gifting pandas due to their dwindling numbers and began loaning them to overseas zoos instead, often in pairs for 10 years, with an annual fee of up to about $1 million. While keeping pandas can be costly for zoos, they are seen as drawcards for visitors and help generate income. The pandas typically return home to southwest China after the loan agreement ends. Panda cubs born overseas are no exception, and would be sent home between the age of two and four to join a Chinese breeding programme. China has a history of using pandas to reward its trading partners. A 2013 Oxford University study said the timing of China's lease of pandas to Canada, France and Australia \"coincided with\" uranium deals and contracts with these countries. The panda agreements with other countries, including Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, also coincided with the signing of free-trade agreements. Sometimes, pandas are also used to express China's displeasure with a nation. In 2010, China recalled two US-born pandas, Tai Shan and Mei Lan, after Beijing warned Washington against a scheduled meeting between then-President Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama, which Beijing views as a dangerous separatist. In a recent downturn in bilateral ties, Ya Ya, on loan to the US for 20 years, was returned in April 2023. Concerns over her health had also fanned nationalist sentiment on China's social media, with animal advocates accusing the Memphis Zoo in Tennessee of providing inadequate care to the animal. In November last year, three other pandas left, leaving only four giant pandas on US soil. That month, Chinese President Xi Jinping then hinted that he was open to sending more pandas to the US after meeting with President Joe Biden in California, a gesture seen as Chinese willingness to improve ties. China's domestic conservation programmes have seen the status of pandas improve from endangered to vulnerable. The population of giant pandas in the wild has grown from around 1,100 in the 1980s to 1,900 in 2023. There are currently 728 pandas in zoos and breeding centres around the world. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : By Doug Drury for The Conversation Rockhampton: On Monday, Virgin Australia flight VA 148 set out from Queenstown in New Zealand bound for Melbourne. Not long after takeoff, the right engine of the Boeing 737-800 jet started emitting loud bangs, followed by flames. The pilot flew on with the remaining engine, bringing the plane’s 73 passengers and crew to a safe emergency landing at nearby Invercargill airport. Virgin Australia says the dramatic turn of events was caused by a “possible bird strike”. Queenstown Airport played down the likelihood of bird strike, saying “no birds were detected on the airfield at that time”. While we don’t know exactly what happened, bird strike is a common and real risk for aircraft. It can damage planes, and even lead to deaths. How common are bird strikes? A bird strike is a collision between an aircraft and a bird. (Though the definition is sometimes expanded to include collisions on the ground with land animals including deer, rabbits, dogs and alligators.) The first bird strike was recorded by Orville Wright in 1905, over a cornfield in Ohio. Now they happen every day, with some seasonal variability due to the migratory patterns of birds. Perhaps the most famous migratory bird strike occurred in 2009, when US Airways Flight 1549 encountered a flock of migrating Canadian geese shortly after taking off from LaGuardia Airport in New York. Both of the plane’s engines failed, and captain Sully Sullenberger was forced to pilot it to an unpowered landing in the Hudson River. Between 2008 and 2017, the Australian Transport Safety Board recorded 16,626 bird strikes. In America, the Federal Aviation Administration reported 17,200 bird strikes in 2022 alone. Where do bird strikes happen, and what are the effects? According to the International Civil Aviation Organization, 90 per cent of bird strikes happen near airports. In general, this is while aircraft are taking off or landing, or flying at lower altitudes where most bird activity occurs. The effect of bird strike depends on many factors including the type of aircraft. Outcomes may include shutting down an engine, as may have happened with the Virgin Australia flight. This plane was a Boeing 737-800, which has the capability to fly on a single engine to an alternate airport. In smaller aircraft, particularly single-engine aircraft, bird strikes can be fatal. Since 1988, 262 bird strike fatalities have been reported globally, and 250 aircraft destroyed. How do manufacturers and pilots defend against bird strike? Most bird strikes occur early in the morning or a sunset when birds are most active. Pilots are trained to be vigilant during these times. Radar can be used to track flocks of birds. However, this technology is ground-based and not available worldwide so it can’t be used everywhere. The two largest manufacturers of passenger jets, Boeing and Airbus, use turbofan engines. These use a series of fan blades to compress air before adding fuel and flame to get the thrust needed to take off. Bird strike in one of these engines can cause severe damage to the fan blades, causing the engine to fail. Engine manufacturers test the safety of these engines by firing a high-speed frozen chicken at them while the engine is operating at full thrust. The Australian Government’s Civil Aviation Safety Authority circular on wildlife hazard management outlines what airports should do to keep birds and animals away from the vicinity of the airport. One technique is to use small gas explosions to mimic the sound of a shotgun to deter birds from loitering near the runway. In areas with high bird populations, airports may also use certain grasses and plants that do not attract the birds.

    "article_content": "Follow Us : By Coco Liu Just like humans, most smartphones function best within a certain temperature range. For devices made by Apple and Samsung, it’s 32°F-95°F (0°C-35°C), while China’s Xiaomi boasts an upper threshold of 104°F. As extreme heat becomes more common, more phones are spending time outside that comfort zone. Once a phone exceeds its normal operating temperature, built-in thermal sensors trigger a series of actions that can include temperature warnings, slowed operations and even shutoff. That’s a feature designed to keep the phone intact while it cools off. But frequent exposure to heat distress can also reduce the lifespan of a smartphone’s battery and damage other internal components. Industry-wide data is hard to come by, but Asurion — a US firm that provides phone insurance services and runs about 700 smartphone repair stores — observed nearly 15 per cent more battery-related issues during last year’s record hot summer compared to the rest of 2023. As this summer shapes up to be even hotter, here’s what you need to know about keeping your smartphone cool, calm and collected. When do smartphones start to overheat? Pretty much everything you do with your handset creates heat, and since smartphones can’t sweat like humans, that heat builds up. When temperatures outside are also high, it doesn’t take long for a phone’s temperature to rise significantly. During last year’s heat wave in Europe, for example, temperatures topping 45°C (115°F) killed a number of mobile phones on the Italian island of Sardinia. “It’s only once you get to an ambient temperature of 110°F or higher, or when the device is exposed to direct sunlight on a very hot day, where the vast majority of phones will begin to run into issues,” says Tom Paton, founder of Green Smartphones, an online phone-comparison platform. That kind of heat is becoming more common as global temperatures rise. May marked the Earth’s 12th consecutive month of record-breaking temperatures, and included heat waves in India, Thailand and Egypt. In the US, a heat dome building over the mid-Atlantic is expected to break temperature records this week. How do you know if your phone is in distress? Most smartphones warn users about imminent overheating. Third-party apps such as AIDA64 (for Android and iOS) and Cooling Master (Android) can also monitor real-time phone temperatures. Paton applies a more basic rule of thumb: If your phone gets uncomfortable to hold, it’s beginning to overheat. A phone that’s performing slowly is another red flag, says Nicholas Bains, a smartphone expert at Asurion. The phone will deliberately slow down its processing so it doesn’t produce even more heat, though Bains warns that this can sometimes happen too late to prevent damage. “Your phone is able to protect itself in the moment,” he says. “But frequent and repeated exposure to high heat can have long-term effects on your phone’s performance and can permanently shorten its battery life.” How can overheating damage your phone? Heat presents a major risk for a smartphone’s battery. While the battery degrades naturally over time, prolonged exposure to high temperatures can wear it out prematurely, says Kyle Wiens, chief executive officer of iFixit, an electronics repair business and advocacy group. The adhesive used for phone screens can also start to loosen once temperatures exceed its melting point, Wiens says. Paton adds that the phone’s central processing unit (CPU) can be damaged if its maximum operating temperature is exceeded. In extreme and rare cases, heat buildup can result in battery combustion, which can cause a fire or small explosion. But most immediately, you’ll experience a loss of functionality and potentially data, as overheating causes apps to glitch or crash. How can I protect my smartphone from heat? Keep your phone out of direct sunlight, or anywhere else the heat might be magnified (like the dashboard of a car). Avoid intensive phone use. The less a phone’s processor has to run, the easier it is for the device to stay cool. To minimize background activity, try using Airplane Mode. Remove your phone case. If you don’t want to strip your handset, there are also phone cases designed to achieve better heat dissipation by using breathable materials and increased airflow. Charge your phone in a cooler environment. Charging itself generates heat, so try to avoid it when your phone is already hot. If you must charge, don’t use the phone while it’s juicing up. Let an overheated phone cool down gradually. Your smartphone doesn’t like heat, but it also doesn’t like extreme temperature fluctuations. Putting a phone in the refrigerator to cool it down, for example, can be as harmful as letting it overheat in the first place. “Sudden temperature changes can cause additional damage to internal components,” Paton says. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : New Delhi: A delegation of US lawmakers met the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama on Wednesday in India's northern town of Dharamsala. The meeting annoyed Beijing, which urged the United States on Tuesday to \"fully recognise the anti-China and separatist nature of the Dalai clique\" and refrain from \"any form of contact with it\". Why is the delegation in India? The bipartisan seven-member group of American lawmakers is visiting India to meet the Nobel peace laureate, the Dalai Lama. The United States has long supported the rights of the Tibetan people to practice their religion and culture, and has accused China of human rights violations in the remote Himalayan region that borders India. A bipartisan bill passed this month by the US House of Representatives aims seeks to push Beijing to hold talks with Tibetan leaders, stalled since 2010, to secure a negotiated agreement on Tibet and spur China to tackle Tibetan aspirations on historical, cultural, religious and linguistic identity. Among the delegation are the two authors of the act, titled 'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act' or the Resolve Tibet Act, along with Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the US House of Representatives. The delegation also met officials of Tibet’s government in exile, which functions from India. Who is the Dalai Lama? Born in 1935 as Lhamo Thondup, the Dalai Lama was identified as the reincarnation of his predecessor at the age of two, and enthroned in 1940 as the 14th Dalai Lama in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital. Beijing invaded Tibet in 1950, and the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against its rule, since when he has lived in exile in the Himalayan town of Dharamsala. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. Why is the visit controversial? It has riled China at a time when Beijing and Washington are struggling to improve ties, and India's relations with China have also been strained since a military standoff on their Himalayan frontier killed 24 soldiers in 2020. US President Joe Biden is expected to sign the Resolve Tibet Act soon, in a bid to find a resolution for the dispute, although Washington considers the Tibetan Autonomous Region to be a part of China. \"This visit should highlight the bipartisan support in the US Congress for Tibet to have a say in their own future,\" the chief of the US delegation, and one author of the bill, Michael McCaul, said ahead of his departure from Washington on Friday. What are China's objections? China accuses the Dalai Lama of being a \"splittist\" or a separatist, but he says he wants genuine autonomy for his remote Himalayan homeland. While Beijing has always objected to his meetings with foreign leaders, this has not prevented the Dalai Lama from meeting them, including US presidents, although Biden has not met him yet. However, the most contentious issue is the task of appointing his successor. While Beijing has said it has the right to approve a successor, in a move set to strengthen its control over Tibet, the Dalai Lama says only the Tibetan people can make that call, and his successor could be found in India. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : London: With extreme heat gripping much of the Northern Hemisphere this week, authorities and public health experts have issued heat warnings to help keep people safe. Parts of China, India, the Middle East, southern Europe and the United States are bracing for the possibility of new record highs. Heat affects health in several ways. Heat exhaustion, which can include dizziness, headaches, shaking and thirst, can affect anyone, and is not usually serious, providing the person cools down within 30 minutes. The more serious version is heatstroke, when the body's core temperature goes above 40.6 degrees Celsius (105 degrees Fahrenheit). It is a medical emergency and can lead to long-term organ damage and death. Symptoms include rapid breathing, confusion or seizures, and nausea. As climate change continues to drive temperatures upward in coming years, the danger of humidity is also expected to rise. Warmer air can hold more moisture. And more moisture in the air makes it harder for people to sweat to cool down. Some people are more vulnerable, including young babies and older people, as well as people who must stay active or are more exposed, such as homeless people. Existing conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as diabetes, can also heighten risk - and be exacerbated by heat. Many countries do not record heat as a specific cause of death, which means we do not have statistics to gauge this risk on communities. However, a 2021 study in The Lancet estimated that just under a half-million deaths can be attributed to excess heat every year - a conservative count that lacks data from many low-income countries. Many in Europe fear a repeat of the 2022 summer, during which heatwaves killed an estimated 61,000 people, scientists said. The risks will continue to rise as climate change pushes global temperatures even higher in coming decades. Apart from testing a body's internal thermostat, extreme heat can pose a host of other, secondary risks. Warmer temperatures encourage the growth of bacteria and algae. So heatwaves can raise the risk of water being contaminated with diseases like cholera, or of water bodies becoming choked with toxic algae. Heat can also damage crops, adding to concerns about food security. Starting from 2030, experts expect that global death tolls will increase by 250,000 per year as a result of four climate-related health risks: heat stress, malnutrition associated with food insecurity, malaria, and diarrhoea, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Wildfires fueled by dried-out trees or shrubs can lead to dangerous levels of air pollution, which can cause lung inflammation and tissue damage. Studies have also suggested that both extreme heat as well as exposure to wildfire smoke could also be linked with low birthweight and premature births. Heat stress can also contribute to poorer mental health. Rising night-time temperatures can disrupt people's sleep patterns, worsening mental health outcomes. Experts say more deaths occur earlier in the summer when people's bodies have not had a chance to acclimatize to the season. Location matters, too; people are at higher risk in places where they are not used to such heat, including parts of Europe. As outdoor work becomes dangerous amid high temperatures, some countries and communities have shuttered schools or forced a shortening of daytime work hours for businesses. Public health agencies from India to the United States have issued advice on keeping cool, including avoiding exertion where possible and staying hydrated. Authorities often aim to help by setting up cooling centers, distributing extra water or providing free access to air-conditioned public transport. Workers should think about having more breaks and changing their clothing too, scientists said. It is important to check in on the vulnerable, including older and isolated people, they said. Heatstroke is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional attention. #Elections2024"

    "article_content": "Follow Us : Bhubaneswar: BJD president Naveen Patnaik held a meeting with his party's nine Rajya Sabha MPs on Monday and asked them to emerge as a \"vibrant and strong\" opposition in the Upper House of Parliament during its upcoming session that would begin on June 27. At the meeting, Patnaik also asked the lawmakers to raise issues concerning the state's interests in a befitting manner. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the party's leader in Rajya Sabha Sasmit Patra said, \"The BJD MPs this time will not be confined to speaking on issues only, but are determined to agitate if the BJP-led government at the Centre ignores Odisha's interest.\" Besides raising the demand for special status to Odisha, the BJD MPs will raise the issues of poor mobile connectivity and low density of bank branches in the state, he said. \"Odisha's demand for revision of coal royalty has been ignored by the Centre for the last 10 years. This is causing great loss to the people of the state who are deprived of their rightful share,\" he added. Maintaining that the nine MPs in Rajya Sabha will act as a strong opposition, Patra said Patnaik has given clear instructions to fight for the rights of the state's people in the Parliament. When asked whether BJD would maintain its earlier stance of giving issue-based support to the BJP-led government, he said, \"No more support to BJP, only opposition. We may go to any extent to protect the interests of Odisha.\" Later, Patra told PTI , \"There is no question of supporting the BJP. The BJD president asked us to act as a strong and vibrant opposition if the NDA government continues to ignore the genuine demands of Odisha.\" The BJD has nine MPs in the Rajya Sabha, while it failed to win any seat in the recently held Lok Sabha elections, for the first time since its formation in 1997. The BJD also lost power in the state with the BJP bringing an end to its government of 24 years. The BJD not only supported the BJP in Parliament on different issues over the last few years but also helped Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw get elected to Rajya Sabha in 2019 and 2024. At a meeting with senior BJD leaders on Sunday, Patnaik had said, \"You all know that the BJP has got four seats more than the majority mark in the Odisha assembly. At the Centre also, it does not have a majority on its own. Hence, you should work hard, stay united, and strengthen the party.\" #Elections2024"
